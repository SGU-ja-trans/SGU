1
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:08,463
<i>I may be on the verge of discovering
the true nature of Destiny's mission.</i>

2
00:00:09,899 --> 00:00:12,596
<i>You've had control of this ship
the whole time!</i>

3
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:14,336
Why wouldn't you tell anyone?

4
00:00:14,404 --> 00:00:17,202
The Lucian Alliance is planning
an attack on Earth.

5
00:00:17,874 --> 00:00:20,900
<i>I killed Riley.
I suffocated him with my own hands.</i>

6
00:00:20,978 --> 00:00:23,242
You are a good commander.

7
00:00:23,313 --> 00:00:26,112
<i>There is no mission other
than getting these people home.</i>

8
00:00:26,184 --> 00:00:29,381
<i>It was never about going home, it's
about getting us to where we're going.</i>

9
00:00:29,454 --> 00:00:31,820
That is the mission.

10
00:00:32,857 --> 00:00:34,916
<i>They're machines.
One simple directive,</i>

11
00:00:35,026 --> 00:00:37,256
<i>"Find alien technology
and destroy it."</i>

12
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:39,159
I'm getting damage reports
from all over the ship!

13
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,529
Rush, whatever you're gonna do,
you got to do it now!

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,363
<i>Recognition software,
friend or foe.</i>

15
00:00:43,435 --> 00:00:45,562
<i>What if we tell them
that they're the enemy?</i>

16
00:00:45,637 --> 00:00:47,298
<i>Ginn and I figured out</i>

17
00:00:47,373 --> 00:00:50,968
<i>how to dial the ninth chevron back to Earth
while Destiny recharges in a star.</i>

18
00:00:51,043 --> 00:00:53,341
<i>Tell them not to try
and dial Earth. It won't work.</i>

19
00:00:53,412 --> 00:00:55,040
<i>If they go through with it,
they're all going to die.</i>

20
00:00:55,115 --> 00:00:56,810
Stop trying to scare people
and get on with this.

21
00:00:56,883 --> 00:00:58,578
Wait three seconds, then follow me!

22
00:00:58,651 --> 00:00:59,743
<i>The connection was made,</i>

23
00:00:59,953 --> 00:01:02,387
but you were the only one
who made it through to Earth.

24
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:07,117
We're down to about 20% efficiency here.

25
00:01:11,065 --> 00:01:12,327
That's about all we're going to get.

26
00:01:14,368 --> 00:01:15,767
Moving on.

27
00:01:20,908 --> 00:01:22,968
- Sir.
- T.J.

28
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:24,979
Hey, I've had a number of people
reporting headaches.

29
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,772
Couple of cases of nausea and dizziness.

30
00:01:26,848 --> 00:01:28,213
I don't know if they're related,

31
00:01:28,283 --> 00:01:30,843
but both cases are sleeping
in fourth floor C quarters.

32
00:01:30,919 --> 00:01:32,750
Yeah, something on this bucket
is always broken.

33
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:36,154
Rush and Brody are working on it.
We need more lime for the air filters.

34
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,859
This is Young. What do we got?

35
00:01:41,964 --> 00:01:42,953
Two gates.

36
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:45,524
One is locked out,
the other looks promising.

37
00:01:46,169 --> 00:01:47,898
I'll send a team.

38
00:01:48,204 --> 00:01:49,899
Whatever you decide to do, I...

39
00:01:49,972 --> 00:01:51,702
- Hey.
- Hey.

40
00:01:51,775 --> 00:01:52,867
They just reported back.

41
00:01:52,943 --> 00:01:55,468
Looks like the planet may have
some of the supplies we need.

42
00:01:55,546 --> 00:01:59,107
Oh! I don't suppose they found any of those
purple fruit we got a while back?

43
00:01:59,183 --> 00:02:00,582
Yeah, yeah.

44
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:02,209
You liked those? Those were awful.

45
00:02:02,286 --> 00:02:03,480
Yeah, they tasted terrible.

46
00:02:05,155 --> 00:02:06,214
So why do you ask?

47
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,024
Why am I always the last one to know?
What were they good for?

48
00:02:12,797 --> 00:02:13,889
Hey, did you see that?

49
00:02:13,965 --> 00:02:15,694
No, no, you can't just change the subject.

50
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:17,564
No, seriously, look!

51
00:02:19,804 --> 00:02:22,103
Something moved out there.

52
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:24,965
There.

53
00:02:28,347 --> 00:02:29,439
What is it?

54
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:35,446
Those are drones.

55
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:43,425
We're under attack.

56
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:02,610
- Evasive maneuvers.
Executing evasive maneuvers.

57
00:03:06,288 --> 00:03:07,585
Weapons active.

58
00:03:15,164 --> 00:03:17,395
- Got one. Five.
- How many are left?

59
00:03:17,467 --> 00:03:19,162
There has to be a command ship
in the vicinity.

60
00:03:19,235 --> 00:03:22,398
Which means a lot more
could be on the way.

61
00:03:32,249 --> 00:03:33,307
Whoa. That can't be good.

62
00:03:33,884 --> 00:03:35,647
We're taking some minor damage.

63
00:03:35,753 --> 00:03:38,688
I'm rerouting power
to shields and weapons.

64
00:03:45,362 --> 00:03:47,422
Nice shot.
You're getting pretty good at that.

65
00:03:47,499 --> 00:03:49,433
- Bring it on.
Let's hope they don't.

66
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:50,490
Maybe we can handle six of them,

67
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:54,528
but we can't jump back into FTL
for another two hours and ten minutes.

68
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,069
That's all of them.

69
00:03:58,143 --> 00:04:00,135
Wait a minute, not exactly.

70
00:04:00,246 --> 00:04:03,807
The command ship just came up
on sensors. It's on an intercept course.

71
00:04:03,883 --> 00:04:05,874
Put them in our six,
give me maximum acceleration.

72
00:04:05,952 --> 00:04:06,976
Yes, sir.

73
00:04:14,928 --> 00:04:17,396
All right, command ship is still gaining,
but just barely.

74
00:04:17,464 --> 00:04:19,762
Now, if we can keep this up
until we're good to jump...

75
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,301
We can't. Not a chance.
We'd blow the engines.

76
00:04:22,936 --> 00:04:25,063
Buy as much time as you can.

77
00:04:30,278 --> 00:04:31,267
What the hell happened?

78
00:04:31,346 --> 00:04:33,906
I thought we left drone-occupied space
behind a long time ago.

79
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,381
Apparently, we were wrong.

80
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,145
No, we weren't.

81
00:04:37,218 --> 00:04:39,550
You think they're tracking us somehow,
coming after us?

82
00:04:39,621 --> 00:04:41,282
- How?
- I'm not sure.

83
00:04:41,356 --> 00:04:43,348
You think it has something to do
with the one we have onboard?

84
00:04:43,425 --> 00:04:44,551
I've considered that.

85
00:04:44,627 --> 00:04:47,357
I thought it might be worth the risk,
you know, to study them.

86
00:04:47,429 --> 00:04:48,623
It's totally dormant.

87
00:04:48,897 --> 00:04:49,955
Get rid of it.

88
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:53,466
Colonel Young, this is Park.

89
00:04:53,602 --> 00:04:57,003
<i>Destiny just cut off power to the
sub-light, probably to prevent a burnout.</i>

90
00:04:57,072 --> 00:04:58,267
Do you want me to override?

91
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,573
- I wouldn't recommend it.
- That's a negative.

92
00:05:00,644 --> 00:05:02,009
<i>How about the command ship?</i>

93
00:05:02,078 --> 00:05:04,137
They've slowed, as well, but still closing.

94
00:05:04,214 --> 00:05:05,909
<i>ETA is less than one hour.</i>

95
00:05:05,982 --> 00:05:07,973
Understood.
How long till we jump?

96
00:05:08,051 --> 00:05:09,643
Yeah, we're cutting it close.

97
00:05:09,719 --> 00:05:10,708
We jumped early before.

98
00:05:10,787 --> 00:05:12,551
And the damage it caused
is precisely the reason

99
00:05:12,623 --> 00:05:14,181
why we can't attempt that again now.

100
00:05:14,258 --> 00:05:16,351
I don't think we can survive
another full-on attack.

101
00:05:17,628 --> 00:05:19,459
You'd better hope that we can.

102
00:05:21,832 --> 00:05:23,390
All right, set her down.

103
00:05:25,136 --> 00:05:26,468
Okay, let's move.

104
00:05:33,545 --> 00:05:35,604
All right, sealed off the area
by the docking collar.

105
00:05:35,681 --> 00:05:37,478
Okay, open the outer door.

106
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:55,365
Destroying that drone only helps us
if we make it to the next jump,

107
00:05:55,436 --> 00:05:57,870
assuming that's how they tracked us
in the first place.

108
00:05:58,972 --> 00:05:59,996
Sorry.

109
00:06:00,574 --> 00:06:01,905
Just panicking out loud.

110
00:06:12,187 --> 00:06:13,313
What's our status?

111
00:06:13,388 --> 00:06:15,913
The command ship's
just coming into range.

112
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:25,959
Okay.

113
00:06:27,803 --> 00:06:29,794
We're not going to make it.

114
00:06:39,116 --> 00:06:40,515
Sir...

115
00:06:50,026 --> 00:06:52,518
We're taking a lot of damage, sir.
We can't hold them off.

116
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:55,655
Now! We have to jump now!

117
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:58,463
Not yet. Transferring all remaining power
to the shields.

118
00:07:05,276 --> 00:07:06,266
Hold on!

119
00:07:14,887 --> 00:07:17,515
Shut off those damn alarms!

120
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:19,989
- How bad is it?
- Well, we're still here.

121
00:07:29,302 --> 00:07:30,326
That was close.

122
00:07:30,403 --> 00:07:34,100
- Yeah. How are the repairs going?
- Could be worse, I guess.

123
00:07:34,174 --> 00:07:35,642
We could use a few more of those robots.

124
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:37,472
Shoot, you're lucky you have two.

125
00:07:37,545 --> 00:07:39,604
No, we're lucky we're still alive.

126
00:07:40,147 --> 00:07:43,116
This ship can't possibly hold up
against another attack like that.

127
00:07:43,184 --> 00:07:46,244
Well, hopefully
they can't track us anymore.

128
00:07:47,054 --> 00:07:49,785
Don't you hate having to start
that sentence with "hopefully"?

129
00:07:53,261 --> 00:07:55,354
We have a planet coming into range.

130
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,955
<i>It appears Destiny wants to drop out
of FTL.</i>

131
00:07:58,033 --> 00:07:59,159
Override it.

132
00:08:00,335 --> 00:08:02,633
We need lime for life support.

133
00:08:03,306 --> 00:08:05,433
This planet might be a good candidate
to have it.

134
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,002
Look, we can't stay in FTL forever.

135
00:08:08,077 --> 00:08:10,841
I'd much rather the ship be
in a better state of repair.

136
00:08:10,913 --> 00:08:13,211
Well, we've dealt with
the most critical issues.

137
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:16,475
Look, I can't guarantee
it's going to be safe,

138
00:08:16,552 --> 00:08:19,681
but I can guarantee
if we don't stop pretty soon,

139
00:08:19,756 --> 00:08:21,724
we're going to have trouble breathing.

140
00:08:22,693 --> 00:08:24,752
Okay. Drop out.

141
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,127
Please tell me there's no more drones
in range.

142
00:08:31,201 --> 00:08:34,933
Screens are clear. For now, anyway.

143
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,171
What do we got?

144
00:08:44,849 --> 00:08:46,875
Good atmosphere. Temperature.

145
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:49,280
Trees. Looks nice.

146
00:08:49,355 --> 00:08:51,323
Okay, let's go.

147
00:08:59,431 --> 00:09:02,196
This is Scott. We're gonna check out
the immediate vicinity of the gate.

148
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:04,169
<i>Have Brody and his team standing by.</i>

149
00:09:04,237 --> 00:09:05,534
Roger that.

150
00:09:05,605 --> 00:09:07,197
Secure the perimeter.

151
00:09:12,412 --> 00:09:13,401
What is it?

152
00:09:13,847 --> 00:09:15,748
I think I heard something.

153
00:09:24,926 --> 00:09:27,121
Stop! Freeze! Halt!

154
00:09:30,766 --> 00:09:32,199
Don't shoot.

155
00:09:33,235 --> 00:09:35,260
- You speak English.
- You came through the gate.

156
00:09:36,004 --> 00:09:37,631
Oh, my God, I know you.

157
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,273
You're Matthew Scott.

158
00:09:42,444 --> 00:09:43,673
And you're Ronald Greer.

159
00:09:46,049 --> 00:09:47,038
How do you know our names?

160
00:09:52,121 --> 00:09:54,214
You're the Ancestors.

161
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,833
They called them the Ancestors?
Why would they say that?

162
00:10:05,903 --> 00:10:08,463
According to Scott,
they claim that their civilization

163
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:12,909
<i>was founded 2,000 years ago
by the crew of the Destiny.</i>

164
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:15,579
They said it was in their
historical archives.

165
00:10:15,647 --> 00:10:17,478
They even had copies of old Kino footage,

166
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:19,983
and that's how they were able
to recognize Scott and Greer.

167
00:10:20,051 --> 00:10:21,678
How is it possible?

168
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:23,476
<i>The other Destiny.</i>

169
00:10:24,823 --> 00:10:26,792
They dialed inside a star, right,

170
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:29,919
and the whole ship went back in time
what, 12 hours?

171
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:33,054
When that happened,
there was two of everyone,

172
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,196
you, me, everyone.

173
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:38,835
We thought that most of them died
in the unstable wormhole

174
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,999
trying to get back to Earth,
but what if they didn't die?

175
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:45,044
What if the wormhole
sent them even further back?

176
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,245
We know solar flares can do that,

177
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:50,579
cause a wormhole to loop back on itself
and move through time.

178
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:53,142
Yeah, but it didn't loop back on itself.

179
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,384
<i>There was no Destiny
here 2,000 years ago.</i>

180
00:10:56,591 --> 00:11:00,391
The wormhole simply jumped
to another gate in the vicinity.

181
00:11:01,663 --> 00:11:05,656
This is unbelievable.
Those people are our descendants.

182
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:07,963
Eli, we didn't go back in time.

183
00:11:08,036 --> 00:11:11,473
Well, no, not us, exactly,
but the other us.

184
00:11:12,174 --> 00:11:13,471
Same DNA.

185
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,341
Come on, am I the only person here

186
00:11:16,412 --> 00:11:18,880
who thinks this could be
the coolest thing ever?

187
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:23,350
Fine, don't you at least want to know
what happened to them?

188
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,321
How they survived
and developed as a society?

189
00:11:26,523 --> 00:11:28,354
<i>You played a lot of SimCity
as a kid, didn't you?</i>

190
00:11:28,425 --> 00:11:30,120
<i>Actually, this is more
like SimEarth.</i>

191
00:11:30,193 --> 00:11:33,185
Come on,
we have to go talk to these people.

192
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,199
There's still no sign of any drones?

193
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,965
No, we should be safe enough here
at the moment.

194
00:11:41,038 --> 00:11:42,335
- See?
But, please,

195
00:11:42,406 --> 00:11:45,341
let's not lose sight
of why we dropped out in the first place.

196
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:47,570
Lime for the scrubbers,
yeah, I know, I know.

197
00:11:48,245 --> 00:11:49,769
All right.

198
00:11:58,423 --> 00:12:02,723
Hey, everyone, this is Jason and Ellie.

199
00:12:07,767 --> 00:12:09,667
- Hello.
- You're Eli Wallace.

200
00:12:10,036 --> 00:12:11,025
Yeah.

201
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:14,831
Chloe Armstrong, and Camile Wray.

202
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:19,234
- Pleased to meet you.
- I don't even know how this is possible.

203
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:22,274
You're all dead, thousands of years ago.

204
00:12:25,152 --> 00:12:28,212
Yes and no.
There's a perfectly good explanation.

205
00:12:28,288 --> 00:12:31,917
<i>The Testament did say that
the Destiny might someday return.</i>

206
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,954
The other me could have guessed
we had gone back in time.

207
00:12:37,165 --> 00:12:40,191
You have to come and meet the others.
The settlement's not far.

208
00:12:40,268 --> 00:12:41,667
Okay, sure, lead the way.

209
00:12:41,736 --> 00:12:43,704
I'll radio ahead and make sure
they know we're coming.

210
00:12:43,772 --> 00:12:44,966
You have radios?

211
00:12:45,874 --> 00:12:47,102
Of course.

212
00:12:47,175 --> 00:12:48,369
No one's going to believe this.

213
00:12:48,443 --> 00:12:50,207
They're totally going to freak out
when they see you.

214
00:12:52,948 --> 00:12:54,006
This is so cool.

215
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:58,116
When we first heard you
come through the gate,

216
00:12:58,187 --> 00:12:59,950
we thought maybe you were from Novus.

217
00:13:00,022 --> 00:13:01,319
What's Novus?

218
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,155
The planet where you founded
our civilization 2,000 years ago.

219
00:13:04,227 --> 00:13:05,660
You mean this isn't it?

220
00:13:05,729 --> 00:13:07,094
This place? No.

221
00:13:07,164 --> 00:13:09,155
Our people came here
as part of an expedition,

222
00:13:09,232 --> 00:13:11,826
one of several sent
to find other viable worlds.

223
00:13:11,902 --> 00:13:13,893
So you use gate travel?

224
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,028
We did.

225
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:16,563
But then one day something happened,

226
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,871
and we couldn't connect
to Novus anymore.

227
00:13:18,943 --> 00:13:20,808
There are no other gates in range.

228
00:13:20,878 --> 00:13:23,813
So you've been stranded here?
How long ago did that happen?

229
00:13:23,881 --> 00:13:26,577
It was before Jason and I were even born.

230
00:13:27,819 --> 00:13:30,515
It's just up this way over here.

231
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:47,670
Hi.

232
00:13:48,741 --> 00:13:51,232
Hey, hey, it's okay. Don't be afraid.

233
00:13:57,684 --> 00:13:58,708
Hello.

234
00:14:14,034 --> 00:14:15,366
Incredible.

235
00:14:15,804 --> 00:14:16,930
This is Yaozu.

236
00:14:18,707 --> 00:14:20,436
That was my father's name.

237
00:14:22,244 --> 00:14:23,643
I'm Camile Wray.

238
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,375
It is an honor to meet you.

239
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,438
Likewise.

240
00:14:31,187 --> 00:14:32,449
Come in, please.

241
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,461
Thank you.

242
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:51,271
May I introduce Landon, Abigale and Betty?

243
00:14:52,442 --> 00:14:53,704
- Betty.
- Hello.

244
00:14:53,777 --> 00:14:55,142
Would you care for some tea?

245
00:14:55,512 --> 00:14:57,377
Yes. Yes, thank you.

246
00:14:57,614 --> 00:14:59,583
- Will you sit?
- Sure. Why not?

247
00:14:59,918 --> 00:15:00,942
Sitting is good.

248
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:13,261
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

249
00:15:13,766 --> 00:15:16,132
You're even more handsome in person.

250
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,930
Betty seems nice.

251
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:28,605
Oh! That's good.

252
00:15:30,483 --> 00:15:32,110
Thank you.

253
00:15:32,185 --> 00:15:36,918
Most of us, myself included,
never imagined this day would come.

254
00:15:37,657 --> 00:15:41,253
<i>Ellie said the Testament
spoke of Destiny's return.</i>

255
00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:44,298
If that's some sort of written history,
I'd love to take a look at it.

256
00:15:44,365 --> 00:15:46,230
- If I could figure out...
- Eli, there's time.

257
00:15:47,401 --> 00:15:49,028
You have questions for us.

258
00:15:49,103 --> 00:15:50,798
We have questions for you, as well,

259
00:15:50,871 --> 00:15:54,671
but first, let me begin
with some ancient words of greeting...

260
00:15:59,381 --> 00:16:00,848
Which means...

261
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,774
Roughly, um,

262
00:16:03,652 --> 00:16:08,282
"May all things go according to the wishes
of those who hear it."

263
00:16:08,357 --> 00:16:09,586
That's right.

264
00:16:18,001 --> 00:16:20,196
There are about 100 people
in this settlement,

265
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:23,706
and a couple of others just like it
scattered in the vicinity of the gate.

266
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,639
That's not much of a civilization.

267
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:28,234
But they claim that Novus,
the planet they came from,

268
00:16:28,312 --> 00:16:30,610
has a population in the millions,

269
00:16:30,681 --> 00:16:34,583
and from the sounds of it,
they were fairly advanced technologically.

270
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:37,419
Obviously they had a head start.
I mean, they had our knowledge.

271
00:16:37,488 --> 00:16:38,751
Did they know they had gone back in time?

272
00:16:38,823 --> 00:16:42,281
No, but apparently the other me
suspected it was possible.

273
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,022
<i>I wrote that one day,
Destiny could return.</i>

274
00:16:45,096 --> 00:16:47,394
Still, they must have been pretty surprised
to see you.

275
00:16:47,932 --> 00:16:50,799
- How long have they been there?
- Thirty years.

276
00:16:52,003 --> 00:16:53,665
They were looking for other viable planets

277
00:16:53,739 --> 00:16:57,869
because their homeworld was suffering
some kind of a natural disaster.

278
00:16:57,943 --> 00:17:00,002
It was volcanoes, earthquakes
or something like that,

279
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:02,579
but I don't know,
they said it was getting pretty bad.

280
00:17:02,782 --> 00:17:05,444
And there was a fair amount
of political tension.

281
00:17:06,185 --> 00:17:07,915
- Not surprising.
- No.

282
00:17:07,988 --> 00:17:09,387
But get this,

283
00:17:10,424 --> 00:17:13,393
there were two predominant countries
on Novus,

284
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,554
each based on
a distinct political philosophy.

285
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:20,157
The people in the expedition
were all from one country called Tenera.

286
00:17:20,233 --> 00:17:23,726
They follow the teachings of this book,
the Testament,

287
00:17:23,805 --> 00:17:26,103
which apparently some of us wrote.

288
00:17:26,808 --> 00:17:31,177
Wait, "Tenera"? That's Ancient.
That means "the land of the young."

289
00:17:31,245 --> 00:17:33,076
Or "the land of Young."

290
00:17:33,681 --> 00:17:36,173
There was also another group of evacuees

291
00:17:37,586 --> 00:17:40,487
who blamed the other me
for what happened.

292
00:17:41,857 --> 00:17:44,690
<i>They thought
Rush was still onboard Destiny</i>

293
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,320
and would one day come and rescue them.

294
00:17:47,396 --> 00:17:50,594
Eventually, he became
some kind of savior figure.

295
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:52,225
They broke off
and formed a country of their own.

296
00:17:52,302 --> 00:17:54,429
Let me guess, "Rusha"?

297
00:17:54,504 --> 00:17:55,835
That's funny.

298
00:17:57,006 --> 00:17:58,769
They called it Futura.

299
00:17:59,175 --> 00:18:00,164
Really?

300
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:01,699
What wrong with Futura?

301
00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:03,103
It's a dumb name.

302
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:04,374
Yeah, how is it dumb?

303
00:18:04,448 --> 00:18:08,214
Apparently, he came up with it.

304
00:18:11,355 --> 00:18:14,722
These people we met believe
that the stargate on Novus

305
00:18:14,792 --> 00:18:18,251
was either damaged or destroyed
in a subsequent earthquake.

306
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,622
Right, so they have no idea
what happened on their homeworld?

307
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:23,022
No.

308
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,601
And check this out. It's a databank,

309
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:28,730
<i>compatible with
Destiny's technology.</i>

310
00:18:29,107 --> 00:18:31,405
It has copies of Kino video clips

311
00:18:31,476 --> 00:18:34,605
the evacuees made their first few years
on the planet.

312
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:35,905
It's us.

313
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:37,108
It's the other us.

314
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,476
Apparently, to the people of Novus,

315
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:44,717
the original Kino is a holy artifact,
like the Dead Sea Scrolls.

316
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,318
Look, are we going to get
the supplies we need or not?

317
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:50,192
Yeah, they're helping us gather
all kinds of stuff.

318
00:18:50,264 --> 00:18:54,496
Good, then perhaps something useful
will come out of this after all.

319
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:01,504
I can't believe you helped found
an entire country

320
00:19:01,576 --> 00:19:04,136
based on the hopes that
he would come and rescue you.

321
00:19:04,212 --> 00:19:06,180
I can't believe you named it Futura.

322
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:07,271
Shut up.

323
00:19:07,348 --> 00:19:09,316
Seriously, isn't that a font?

324
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:14,515
All right, this right here.

325
00:19:15,391 --> 00:19:18,360
Medicinal, food, food.
Okay, thank you very much.

326
00:19:18,694 --> 00:19:20,753
This also goes to Becker, all right?

327
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:24,492
There's a station set up in the Gate Room.
Okay? Make it happen.

328
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,369
Cold. Hydroponics.

329
00:19:36,146 --> 00:19:38,239
Just place it right over there.

330
00:19:39,649 --> 00:19:42,015
This is our bridge.

331
00:19:44,455 --> 00:19:45,888
This is awesome!

332
00:19:45,957 --> 00:19:47,288
He said "awesome."

333
00:19:47,358 --> 00:19:49,690
I'd like you to meet Dr. Rush.
- Hello.

334
00:19:51,262 --> 00:19:52,752
I was just leaving, actually.

335
00:19:57,802 --> 00:19:59,134
Well, you can stay as long as you like.

336
00:19:59,204 --> 00:20:01,104
I'm sure Doctors Volker and Park

337
00:20:01,573 --> 00:20:03,632
have many amusing stories
to fascinate you with.

338
00:20:06,078 --> 00:20:08,137
Is everything all right?

339
00:20:08,447 --> 00:20:11,541
There are those somewhat less enlightened
among our people

340
00:20:11,617 --> 00:20:13,313
who believe he is a demon

341
00:20:13,386 --> 00:20:15,354
who rips souls from human bodies

342
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:18,822
and takes them to hell
where they suffer for all eternity.

343
00:20:22,595 --> 00:20:23,823
It's funny how things have a way

344
00:20:23,896 --> 00:20:26,660
of getting twisted and exaggerated
over time.

345
00:20:26,734 --> 00:20:28,395
While others don't.

346
00:20:29,203 --> 00:20:30,602
He's not that bad.

347
00:20:30,904 --> 00:20:32,769
Many Futurans worship him like a god.

348
00:20:34,174 --> 00:20:36,642
We won't tell him that.

349
00:20:44,486 --> 00:20:46,283
I thought you said it was compatible.

350
00:20:46,354 --> 00:20:47,912
Nothing ever works
the way it's supposed to.

351
00:20:49,491 --> 00:20:50,480
Oh!

352
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:51,983
There.

353
00:20:52,594 --> 00:20:54,960
<i>This is the spot
where we're going to break ground.</i>

354
00:20:55,298 --> 00:21:01,168
<i>Hard to imagine now, but one day,
hopefully, this will all be one big city.</i>

355
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:05,929
<i>And we took a final vote last night
to name the planet.</i>

356
00:21:06,008 --> 00:21:08,841
<i>I suggested it should be something
in Ancient.</i>

357
00:21:08,911 --> 00:21:12,712
<i>Volker said Novus Mundus,
which means "New World."</i>

358
00:21:12,783 --> 00:21:16,651
<i>While appropriate, nobody
really liked the sound of "Mundus,"</i>

359
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,881
<i>except Volker.</i>

360
00:21:19,222 --> 00:21:21,713
<i>Anyway, Novus ended up winning out,</i>

361
00:21:22,292 --> 00:21:26,354
<i>which, it's kind of strange,
because it just... It means "new."</i>

362
00:21:27,365 --> 00:21:29,424
<i>Like, new what?</i>

363
00:21:32,437 --> 00:21:35,964
<i>Well, new everything, I guess,
so Novus it is.</i>

364
00:21:40,612 --> 00:21:43,342
And here we are back at the Gate Room.

365
00:21:45,284 --> 00:21:46,808
This ship is incredible.

366
00:21:46,885 --> 00:21:47,977
It has its flaws.

367
00:21:48,053 --> 00:21:50,214
- Thank you for showing us around.
- You're welcome.

368
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:53,123
And thank you for your people's help
gathering supplies.

369
00:21:53,193 --> 00:21:55,093
They will serve us well for some time.

370
00:21:55,161 --> 00:21:58,062
You've been so kind and patient
answering all our questions.

371
00:21:58,131 --> 00:21:59,428
My pleasure.

372
00:21:59,499 --> 00:22:01,467
We only have one more thing to ask of you.

373
00:22:01,668 --> 00:22:02,896
Of course. What is it?

374
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,564
Will you take us home?

375
00:22:06,206 --> 00:22:08,107
We haven't been able
to dial the gate,

376
00:22:08,175 --> 00:22:09,870
but that doesn't mean that
all of Novus is destroyed.

377
00:22:09,944 --> 00:22:11,707
Just that the gate isn't working.

378
00:22:11,779 --> 00:22:13,144
This ship could take us there.

379
00:22:14,048 --> 00:22:15,106
All of you?

380
00:22:15,182 --> 00:22:19,175
We were supposed to build a colony,
but only with the help of our homeworld,

381
00:22:19,253 --> 00:22:22,553
and an open gateway providing
ongoing support and supplies.

382
00:22:22,624 --> 00:22:23,818
I understand that, but...

383
00:22:23,892 --> 00:22:26,326
We're surviving, but just barely.

384
00:22:27,162 --> 00:22:29,130
We have struggled
through great hardship.

385
00:22:29,197 --> 00:22:32,064
It's hard to imagine
the beliefs of the Futurans

386
00:22:32,134 --> 00:22:34,068
could be so close to the truth,

387
00:22:34,536 --> 00:22:36,869
but here you are, all of you,

388
00:22:38,574 --> 00:22:40,439
come to rescue us.

389
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:44,204
Shouldn't we try and help them?

390
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,581
Forget the relationship,
they're human beings.

391
00:22:47,817 --> 00:22:51,549
Imagine if the situation were reversed,
and it was us asking them for help.

392
00:22:51,622 --> 00:22:52,748
And we did,

393
00:22:52,823 --> 00:22:56,452
and despite the fact that they barely have
enough to survive on their own,

394
00:22:56,527 --> 00:22:59,257
they've helped us gather
everything we need and more.

395
00:22:59,329 --> 00:23:01,991
Yeah, because they thought
we were their way off that planet.

396
00:23:02,065 --> 00:23:03,657
Well, correct me if I am wrong,

397
00:23:03,734 --> 00:23:06,533
but we can't take that many people
onboard even if we want to.

398
00:23:06,604 --> 00:23:08,799
Based on the address,
I figured out where Novus is.

399
00:23:08,873 --> 00:23:10,306
It would only take us a week to get there,

400
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:12,969
and, yes, yes, I've done the math.

401
00:23:13,044 --> 00:23:14,875
With the lime we got from the planet,

402
00:23:14,946 --> 00:23:18,713
we should be able to make it just before
the atmosphere on the ship gets toxic.

403
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,308
Yeah, with nothing in reserve.

404
00:23:20,386 --> 00:23:23,219
So what happens if we get there
and we don't find any more?

405
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,487
We're stuck,

406
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:27,958
and that's not to mention
the drain on our food and water supplies.

407
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,721
These people were advanced 30 years ago.
They could be even more advanced now.

408
00:23:31,797 --> 00:23:33,993
Hell, maybe they could even help us
restore the ship

409
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,625
to its full working capacity.

410
00:23:35,702 --> 00:23:37,863
Or they could have died
in subsequent earthquakes.

411
00:23:37,938 --> 00:23:40,998
I mean, do they even know what was
causing the problem in the first place?

412
00:23:41,074 --> 00:23:42,132
According to Yaozu,

413
00:23:42,209 --> 00:23:44,177
their scientists
were beginning to form a theory

414
00:23:44,244 --> 00:23:46,542
before the expedition was launched.

415
00:23:47,081 --> 00:23:48,639
They had evidence to suggest

416
00:23:48,716 --> 00:23:52,243
that a rogue black hole
was approaching their solar system.

417
00:23:52,954 --> 00:23:54,615
Well, I take it that's not good.

418
00:23:54,689 --> 00:23:58,557
The resulting tidal forces
could tear the whole system apart.

419
00:23:58,626 --> 00:24:01,026
So we could use all our supplies
to get them there,

420
00:24:01,095 --> 00:24:03,257
and then find no planet?

421
00:24:03,332 --> 00:24:06,267
It might not have happened yet.
It could take hundreds of years.

422
00:24:06,335 --> 00:24:08,098
Please, let's not forget,

423
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:10,900
we still don't know
how those drones tracked us.

424
00:24:11,773 --> 00:24:12,899
Now, until we figure that out,

425
00:24:12,975 --> 00:24:18,073
our best form of defense is to spend
as little time out of FTL as possible.

426
00:24:18,147 --> 00:24:21,514
The last thing we need right now
is an unnecessary drain on our resources.

427
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:25,714
The planet's in our path,
so we check it out.

428
00:24:26,122 --> 00:24:28,283
If they are still alive,
maybe we can help them fix the gate,

429
00:24:28,358 --> 00:24:29,723
and they can rescue their own people.

430
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,721
Is that your final decision?

431
00:24:32,796 --> 00:24:34,388
Let's finish loading the supplies.

432
00:24:41,739 --> 00:24:43,730
<i>- Eli, get that thing out of my face!
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.</i>

433
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:49,669
<i>Yeah, it's time.</i>

434
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:54,180
<i>On the next contraction,
I want you to push, okay?</i>

435
00:24:54,252 --> 00:24:55,844
<i>Okay.
All right.</i>

436
00:24:57,923 --> 00:24:59,482
<i>Keep pushing!</i>

437
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:03,552
<i>- Keep pushing! Keep pushing!
- I'm pushing! Where is he?</i>

438
00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:05,961
<i>Matt said they were scouting a place
for an irrigation canal.</i>

439
00:25:06,032 --> 00:25:07,363
<i>That was hours ago!</i>

440
00:25:07,433 --> 00:25:10,266
<i>Yeah. He's gonna be here,
all right? Just stay focused.</i>

441
00:25:10,336 --> 00:25:11,325
<i>Okay.</i>

442
00:25:11,971 --> 00:25:13,872
<i>Deep breath and then push.</i>

443
00:25:14,308 --> 00:25:15,297
<i>Now!</i>

444
00:25:19,513 --> 00:25:21,037
<i>- Hey.
- Hi.</i>

445
00:25:21,114 --> 00:25:23,810
<i>- I didn't want you to miss it.
No, I'm here.</i>

446
00:25:23,984 --> 00:25:26,043
<i>It's gonna be all right.</i>

447
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:27,712
<i>I can feel
the baby's head.</i>

448
00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:31,953
<i>Okay, on the next contraction, I
want you to give one big push, okay?</i>

449
00:25:32,026 --> 00:25:33,015
<i>Okay.</i>

450
00:25:41,303 --> 00:25:42,292
<i>It's a boy!</i>

451
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,566
<i>A boy!</i>

452
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,777
<i>First baby is born on Novus.</i>

453
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,887
<i>He's beautiful!</i>

454
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:23,078
<i>We have been here 10 years now.</i>

455
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,808
<i>Our little town's coming along.</i>

456
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,250
<i>Some of us even have children.</i>

457
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,256
<i>It's been a struggle at times,</i>

458
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:38,563
<i>but it's been kind of fun to
try to find ways to make this work.</i>

459
00:26:41,401 --> 00:26:46,771
<i>I just wish my mother could see
what I've done, meet her grandson.</i>

460
00:26:52,045 --> 00:26:54,378
<i>That's my only real
regret in all this.</i>

461
00:26:59,353 --> 00:27:01,821
<i>I remember
when we first came here.</i>

462
00:27:01,889 --> 00:27:05,347
<i>It was, well, it feels like
a long time ago now. It was...</i>

463
00:27:05,426 --> 00:27:10,831
<i>We had very little, it was really hard,
but I think it brought us together.</i>

464
00:27:11,433 --> 00:27:14,869
<i>Everything we have here,
we have built with our own hands,</i>

465
00:27:15,503 --> 00:27:19,269
<i>and now we stand at a precipice.</i>

466
00:27:19,541 --> 00:27:25,606
<i>Some of us want to divide,
and sure, yes, we have our issues,</i>

467
00:27:25,681 --> 00:27:29,082
<i>and we have our differences,
but we can't lose perspective.</i>

468
00:27:29,151 --> 00:27:33,383
<i>As your leader, I may not
have been perfect, I know that.</i>

469
00:27:33,823 --> 00:27:38,227
<i>But I know that I tried my best,
and that I persevered.</i>

470
00:27:38,295 --> 00:27:43,198
<i>Now, as a group, we will survive.</i>

471
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,497
<i>We will prosper
as long as we can remember</i>

472
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:49,733
<i>above anything else
that we need each other,</i>

473
00:27:50,475 --> 00:27:53,103
<i>and we need to help each other.</i>

474
00:28:00,184 --> 00:28:03,813
That doesn't change anything
here and now.

475
00:28:04,055 --> 00:28:06,820
I just thought it might sway your decision

476
00:28:07,693 --> 00:28:09,923
seeing that they are us.

477
00:28:10,195 --> 00:28:14,359
As much as we'd like to ignore
their problems, we're all human beings.

478
00:28:15,434 --> 00:28:17,902
We have a responsibility to each other,
don't we?

479
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,337
Well, unfortunately, what we should do
and what we can do

480
00:28:20,406 --> 00:28:21,395
are too far apart.

481
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:26,140
We'll stop by their home planet,
and we'll see what happened.

482
00:28:29,415 --> 00:28:31,110
I'd like to say goodbye.

483
00:28:31,184 --> 00:28:32,173
Sure.

484
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,963
It's not a question of not wanting to help.
It's a question of resources.

485
00:28:44,031 --> 00:28:47,468
There are so many of you,
and the ship's damaged,

486
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:49,432
and I'm so sorry.

487
00:28:50,205 --> 00:28:53,140
So, it seems the Futurans were wrong
after all.

488
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:55,199
I only wish we'd known sooner.

489
00:28:55,744 --> 00:28:58,474
We could have avoided
generations of conflict.

490
00:28:58,547 --> 00:29:01,311
We may be able to get the Novus gate
up and running again.

491
00:29:01,784 --> 00:29:04,617
If we can, we'll dial in and let you know.

492
00:29:08,357 --> 00:29:09,722
We'll be waiting.

493
00:29:14,897 --> 00:29:16,729
What was that?
Eli?

494
00:29:17,201 --> 00:29:18,327
I don't know.

495
00:29:18,402 --> 00:29:19,528
Over there.

496
00:29:24,641 --> 00:29:26,131
Oh, my God.
What?

497
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:29,236
- What was that?
- We need to get the hell out of here now!

498
00:29:31,015 --> 00:29:33,779
- Do you have a safe place to hide, a cave?
- Not nearby.

499
00:29:34,185 --> 00:29:35,413
We have to get to the gate!

500
00:29:35,486 --> 00:29:36,919
We need to evacuate your people
right now.

501
00:29:36,988 --> 00:29:39,456
- I don't understand...
Incoming!

502
00:29:39,524 --> 00:29:41,389
Go, go, go, go! Run!

503
00:29:41,459 --> 00:29:43,825
Go to the gate! Go to the gate!
Go, go, go! Hurry!

504
00:29:44,262 --> 00:29:45,628
Come on, go, go, go!

505
00:29:45,965 --> 00:29:48,365
Jason,
take everyone to the gate now!

506
00:30:02,949 --> 00:30:05,179
- Report.
- A command ship just dropped out.

507
00:30:05,518 --> 00:30:07,611
- Can we jump?
Yeah, we're good.

508
00:30:07,687 --> 00:30:11,783
Brody, this is Young. Dial the planet.
Get Scott's team back here immediately.

509
00:30:11,858 --> 00:30:14,657
<i>They just dialed in. Drones
are attacking the planet, as well.</i>

510
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:17,994
<i>Scott is requesting permission
to evacuate the locals to Destiny.</i>

511
00:30:21,235 --> 00:30:24,033
Tell him to go ahead.
We'll hold them off as long as we can.

512
00:30:26,474 --> 00:30:28,204
Come on, come on, come on! Go, go, go!

513
00:30:28,277 --> 00:30:29,676
Come on!

514
00:30:29,978 --> 00:30:31,377
Go, go, go!

515
00:30:31,446 --> 00:30:33,141
- We got this!
- No way!

516
00:30:33,215 --> 00:30:35,149
Not until these people are safe!

517
00:30:37,286 --> 00:30:38,776
Come on, right up there.

518
00:30:39,221 --> 00:30:43,420
Okay, guys, keep coming through!
Keep coming, don't bunch up!

519
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:48,094
- How the hell did they find us?
- I don't know.

520
00:30:48,665 --> 00:30:50,223
To the left, to the left! Come on!

521
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,995
Get down! Get down!

522
00:31:22,934 --> 00:31:24,527
We can't take much more of this.

523
00:31:24,737 --> 00:31:26,534
<i>Colonel, we've lost the
connection to the planet.</i>

524
00:31:26,605 --> 00:31:28,334
<i>Scott and his team
still haven't come through.</i>

525
00:31:28,407 --> 00:31:30,102
Well, try to dial them.
Find out what happened.

526
00:31:30,176 --> 00:31:32,303
<i>We've tried already!
The address won't connect.</i>

527
00:31:32,378 --> 00:31:35,142
The gate is now saying
it's no longer operational.

528
00:31:38,952 --> 00:31:40,943
Okay, that's it. We have to go.

529
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,179
Make the jump.

530
00:31:44,524 --> 00:31:46,116
- Colonel!
- Do it!

531
00:32:04,579 --> 00:32:07,549
I hate to be the one to say this,
but we're stranded here.

532
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:13,351
<i>Well, even if we can't use the gate,
Destiny can still come back for us.</i>

533
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:17,049
- What?
They were under attack, as well,

534
00:32:17,126 --> 00:32:18,491
and the ship was already damaged.

535
00:32:19,328 --> 00:32:22,025
Even if they got away,
they wouldn't be able to risk it.

536
00:32:22,132 --> 00:32:23,463
But the drones are gone.

537
00:32:23,533 --> 00:32:25,091
But they don't know that.

538
00:32:25,168 --> 00:32:27,033
And without the gate,
we have no way to tell them.

539
00:32:28,304 --> 00:32:29,771
What were those things?

540
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:31,033
Robot ships.

541
00:32:31,441 --> 00:32:33,068
There's no pilots.

542
00:32:33,143 --> 00:32:35,077
A mechanical army of drones

543
00:32:35,145 --> 00:32:38,013
programmed to seek out and destroy
all technology foreign to them.

544
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:40,982
They took out our generators
and long-range transmitter.

545
00:32:41,052 --> 00:32:45,216
And they were built to win a war
between two alien races in this galaxy.

546
00:32:45,289 --> 00:32:48,349
When the war was over,
the weapons were left behind.

547
00:32:48,426 --> 00:32:49,893
Why would they come here?

548
00:32:52,597 --> 00:32:54,121
That might be our fault.

549
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,060
We encountered them
a little while ago.

550
00:32:57,269 --> 00:32:59,169
It seems they've been tracking us
ever since.

551
00:32:59,237 --> 00:33:02,138
We thought we'd lost them,
but apparently not.

552
00:33:02,741 --> 00:33:04,106
<i>They're chasing Destiny.</i>

553
00:33:04,176 --> 00:33:08,079
It still doesn't explain
how they found us here.

554
00:33:11,384 --> 00:33:12,442
The gate.

555
00:33:13,986 --> 00:33:17,114
An active gate
is a massive subspace event.

556
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:20,458
They must have found a way to detect it
from long range.

557
00:33:21,395 --> 00:33:24,125
You said that there were
more settlements nearby.

558
00:33:24,631 --> 00:33:27,395
Do they have generators
and other technology, as well?

559
00:33:30,237 --> 00:33:31,329
We have to warn them.

560
00:33:34,909 --> 00:33:36,604
It's probably too late.

561
00:33:38,913 --> 00:33:41,939
It has to be the active gate.
Every time we drop out, we dial.

562
00:33:42,016 --> 00:33:44,416
We've been broadcasting our position
through subspace.

563
00:33:44,486 --> 00:33:45,646
It's the only thing that would explain

564
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,951
<i>why they attacked the planet
and Destiny at the same time.</i>

565
00:33:48,023 --> 00:33:50,992
So we are safe as long as we don't dial.

566
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,119
But the gate is our supply line.

567
00:33:53,195 --> 00:33:55,595
Well, we can use a shuttle in the meantime,
as necessary.

568
00:33:55,664 --> 00:33:59,464
The drones' ability to detect an
active gate must have some limitation.

569
00:34:00,069 --> 00:34:01,935
Well, I'll have to do the calculations,
but I agree.

570
00:34:02,005 --> 00:34:04,496
We should be able to use the gates again
at some point.

571
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,842
Okay, what about the team on the planet?

572
00:34:10,413 --> 00:34:12,404
Well, we don't even know
if they're still alive.

573
00:34:12,983 --> 00:34:14,678
Don't we have to take that chance?

574
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:19,318
And risk the ship and everyone onboard?

575
00:34:24,795 --> 00:34:25,784
He's right.

576
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:54,087
Listen, I'm sorry. We're not going back.

577
00:35:07,741 --> 00:35:09,834
Camile said you were out here.
What are you doing?

578
00:35:11,045 --> 00:35:13,240
I had an idea,
wanted to check something out.

579
00:35:13,315 --> 00:35:16,182
I'm assuming
this thing's never going to dial again.

580
00:35:16,251 --> 00:35:17,650
No.

581
00:35:18,053 --> 00:35:19,452
So, what's your plan?

582
00:35:19,521 --> 00:35:22,319
Gates use short range
subspace transmitters.

583
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:25,382
<i>It's how they communicate status updates
with Destiny</i>

584
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,722
before it even drops out or dials,

585
00:35:26,795 --> 00:35:29,993
and I was thinking maybe we can use it
to send a message.

586
00:35:30,066 --> 00:35:32,534
Tell them the drones are gone,
it's safe to pick us up.

587
00:35:32,602 --> 00:35:35,070
And won't the signal call the drones back?

588
00:35:36,105 --> 00:35:37,231
I would like to say no.

589
00:35:38,574 --> 00:35:41,202
The signal is several
thousand times fainter

590
00:35:41,277 --> 00:35:42,939
than the event
caused by an active wormhole.

591
00:35:43,814 --> 00:35:45,304
But you can't know for sure.

592
00:35:45,749 --> 00:35:47,774
It's a calculated risk.

593
00:35:48,185 --> 00:35:50,813
<i>But if the signal's that faint,
will it even reach Destiny?</i>

594
00:35:50,887 --> 00:35:52,411
They've probably
already jumped into FTL by now.

595
00:35:52,489 --> 00:35:55,390
No, it should reach them
if they haven't gone too far.

596
00:35:55,459 --> 00:35:57,690
So this is a total crapshoot.

597
00:35:57,795 --> 00:35:58,784
It...

598
00:35:59,163 --> 00:36:00,152
Pretty much.

599
00:36:02,133 --> 00:36:04,124
So far, I haven't even figured out
how to send a message.

600
00:36:04,202 --> 00:36:06,898
All I can do
is turn this stupid thing off and on.

601
00:36:11,944 --> 00:36:13,935
"Mundus"?
Yeah.

602
00:36:14,013 --> 00:36:16,447
Ancient for "world."
Novus Mundus. "New World."

603
00:36:16,515 --> 00:36:17,709
It sounds stupid.

604
00:36:17,783 --> 00:36:19,842
Yeah, and "Futura" sounds cool?

605
00:36:19,918 --> 00:36:21,977
Yeah, obviously, it's a matter of opinion.

606
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,578
It's a font.

607
00:36:24,256 --> 00:36:25,656
What do we got?

608
00:36:25,992 --> 00:36:27,687
Not sure. Have a look.

609
00:36:27,961 --> 00:36:31,897
It just started blinking like that.
I'm not sure what it means.

610
00:36:40,041 --> 00:36:41,201
I do.

611
00:36:41,676 --> 00:36:45,407
This is Young.
Rush, Chloe, I need you on the bridge now.

612
00:36:47,214 --> 00:36:48,841
It's Morse code.

613
00:36:56,925 --> 00:36:59,223
- Morning.
- Morning.

614
00:37:00,996 --> 00:37:04,557
I'm starting to get the feeling that
we may have to settle in here for good.

615
00:37:05,534 --> 00:37:07,969
- One more shot.
Eli! Hey!

616
00:37:08,404 --> 00:37:10,702
Hey, you did it.

617
00:37:11,374 --> 00:37:13,274
- I did it?
- Yeah, it worked.

618
00:37:13,343 --> 00:37:14,332
How do you know?

619
00:37:23,087 --> 00:37:24,076
Yes!

620
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:29,690
You did it!

621
00:37:31,628 --> 00:37:34,153
Colonel Young said
we're going to take these people home.

622
00:37:52,385 --> 00:37:53,784
Sorry. Hey.

623
00:37:54,086 --> 00:37:55,075
Thanks.

624
00:37:56,856 --> 00:38:00,087
I know I said I wanted to help these
people, but I got to be honest.

625
00:38:01,227 --> 00:38:02,626
I'm glad we're almost there.

626
00:38:02,695 --> 00:38:04,424
I think it's been kind of fun.

627
00:38:04,497 --> 00:38:06,295
Don't tell that to Rush.

628
00:38:06,566 --> 00:38:08,591
He's been even grumpier than usual.

629
00:38:08,702 --> 00:38:10,226
He says the CO2 they're producing

630
00:38:10,303 --> 00:38:13,204
has completely offset the extra lime
we brought onboard.

631
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,872
When they leave, we'll just be right back
to where we started.

632
00:38:15,942 --> 00:38:17,933
Some of them are saying
they'd like to stay.

633
00:38:18,011 --> 00:38:20,537
I know.
You think Colonel Young will let them?

634
00:38:20,615 --> 00:38:22,139
Guess it depends on how many.

635
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:25,481
Well, do you think their planet's going
to be in one piece when we get there?

636
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,316
Absolutely.

637
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,515
The way they described
the seismic activity,

638
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,683
I'd say they got years
before it goes critical.

639
00:38:31,759 --> 00:38:32,783
I don't know.

640
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:35,557
It was bad enough to make them send out
those expeditions in the first place,

641
00:38:35,964 --> 00:38:37,795
and that was 30 years ago.

642
00:38:37,866 --> 00:38:39,800
And what about the politics?

643
00:38:39,868 --> 00:38:41,233
I overheard some of them talking,

644
00:38:41,303 --> 00:38:43,771
and it sounds like
things were getting pretty bad.

645
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,000
Apparently, both sides
had nuclear weapons.

646
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:49,010
No, no, there's no way
it would have come to that.

647
00:38:49,078 --> 00:38:52,013
But they were facing
an escalating natural disaster,

648
00:38:52,081 --> 00:38:53,378
putting pressure on their resources...

649
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,941
Which just as easily
could have brought them together.

650
00:38:57,253 --> 00:39:00,188
Guys, they're our descendants.

651
00:39:01,124 --> 00:39:04,390
We passed down all of our knowledge,
our understanding.

652
00:39:04,462 --> 00:39:06,987
And apparently,
some of our disagreements.

653
00:39:07,832 --> 00:39:09,959
Lieutenant.
- Sir.

654
00:39:10,034 --> 00:39:11,365
We're about to drop out.

655
00:39:11,435 --> 00:39:13,960
As soon as we're in range,
you're going to be flying the first recon.

656
00:39:14,672 --> 00:39:16,071
Yes, sir. I'll go prep the shuttle.

657
00:39:16,675 --> 00:39:18,870
- If it's okay...
- Permission granted.

658
00:39:19,644 --> 00:39:20,633
Thank you.

659
00:39:32,091 --> 00:39:34,059
We'll be passing into
the atmosphere shortly.

660
00:39:38,798 --> 00:39:40,163
No radio signals.

661
00:39:40,366 --> 00:39:43,096
Yeah. I noticed that.

662
00:39:43,836 --> 00:39:45,361
They're supposed to be advanced, right?

663
00:39:55,782 --> 00:39:57,977
- So?
- They're entering the atmosphere.

664
00:39:58,952 --> 00:40:00,477
<i>We're passing through
what appears to be</i>

665
00:40:00,555 --> 00:40:02,785
<i>a pretty thick layer of
particulate matter.</i>

666
00:40:03,091 --> 00:40:04,615
Dust and ash.

667
00:40:08,096 --> 00:40:11,429
All right, getting a reading
on surface temperatures.

668
00:40:16,338 --> 00:40:18,169
It's pretty cold down there.

669
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,534
Oh, God.

670
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:21,869
A nuclear winter.

671
00:40:21,944 --> 00:40:23,172
<i>All right,
cloud's breaking up.</i>

672
00:40:23,245 --> 00:40:25,577
<i>We should be able to see
something here pretty soon.</i>

673
00:40:26,248 --> 00:40:27,237
Whoa!

674
00:40:30,353 --> 00:40:31,342
What is it?

675
00:40:33,023 --> 00:40:34,422
It's a city.

676
00:40:37,127 --> 00:40:40,153
It's a huge, modern city,
and it's completely intact.

677
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,958
It's incredible.

678
00:40:51,275 --> 00:40:53,675
I'm not picking up any radioactivity.

679
00:40:53,878 --> 00:40:56,643
In fact, we're not getting any EM at all.

680
00:40:57,683 --> 00:40:59,742
Of course.
- What?

681
00:41:00,819 --> 00:41:03,379
Well, the layer of dust and ash,
blocking out sunlight,

682
00:41:03,455 --> 00:41:05,650
lowering surface temperatures.

683
00:41:06,124 --> 00:41:08,251
There's really
only one possible explanation.

684
00:41:08,627 --> 00:41:12,621
Extreme volcanic activity.
Like a super-volcano, or worse.

685
00:41:12,699 --> 00:41:16,726
Not exactly nuclear winter,
but just as devastating.

686
00:41:20,073 --> 00:41:21,597
Are you seeing any movement down there?

687
00:41:23,977 --> 00:41:24,966
Negative.

688
00:41:29,883 --> 00:41:32,750
I'm gonna bring us in for a closer look.

689
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:40,257
Sir, we've done another close pass
over the city including the outskirts.

690
00:41:41,529 --> 00:41:43,156
We're not seeing any signs of people.

691
00:41:43,231 --> 00:41:46,792
No smoke from fires,
no tracks in the snow, nothing.

692
00:41:50,205 --> 00:41:53,903
It doesn't look like anyone's
been around here for a long time.

693
00:41:56,312 --> 00:41:58,177
But millions of people lived here.

694
00:42:00,816 --> 00:42:02,681
Where did they all go?

695
00:43:28,176 --> 00:43:29,165
English - US - SDH
