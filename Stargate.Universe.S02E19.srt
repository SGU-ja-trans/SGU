1
00:00:04,188 --> 00:00:08,625
<i>I may be on the verge of discovering
the true nature of Destiny's mission.</i>

2
00:00:10,059 --> 00:00:13,028
<i>You've had control of this ship
the whole time!</i>

3
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,563
Why wouldn't you tell anyone?

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,463
The Lucian Alliance is planning
an attack on Earth.

5
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:21,126
<i>I killed Riley.
I suffocated him with my own hands.</i>

6
00:00:21,236 --> 00:00:23,204
You are a good commander.

7
00:00:23,472 --> 00:00:26,339
<i>There is no mission other
than getting these people home.</i>

8
00:00:26,408 --> 00:00:29,570
<i>It was never about going home, it's
about getting us to where we're going.</i>

9
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,042
That is the mission.

10
00:00:32,713 --> 00:00:34,806
- How do you know our names?
- You're the Ancestors.

11
00:00:35,349 --> 00:00:37,909
<i>It sounds like ALS, Lou
Gehrig's Disease.</i>

12
00:00:37,985 --> 00:00:39,417
Hell of a lot of data here.

13
00:00:39,486 --> 00:00:41,249
Yeah, it looks like
they documented everything.

14
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:44,821
We've been searching what we were
able to transfer from the archive.

15
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:46,516
The ALS cure wasn't in there.

16
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:49,227
<i>What were those things?
A mechanical army of drones.</i>

17
00:00:49,295 --> 00:00:51,125
<i>We encountered them
a little while ago.</i>

18
00:00:51,196 --> 00:00:52,891
<i>It seems they've been tracking us
ever since.</i>

19
00:00:52,965 --> 00:00:54,830
<i>This one canister alone
will last for years.</i>

20
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,026
<i>For CO2 scrubbing.</i>

21
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:58,262
We'll certainly need it
with all these extra people on board.

22
00:00:58,337 --> 00:01:00,497
<i>Well, it's just 10 days
till we drop them off</i>

23
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:02,698
<i>with the people on the
expedition planet.</i>

24
00:01:08,846 --> 00:01:12,212
<i>I'd like to thank you all
for coming to this very special occasion,</i>

25
00:01:12,716 --> 00:01:15,207
<i>the dedication of our
beautiful new school.</i>

26
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:18,019
Hey. Do you have those calculations?

27
00:01:18,088 --> 00:01:21,352
<i>Laying down the foundation
for our educations.</i>

28
00:01:21,423 --> 00:01:23,721
<i>That's why this new
school bears his name.</i>

29
00:01:24,894 --> 00:01:26,361
Bottom left corner.

30
00:01:26,428 --> 00:01:29,158
<i>Do my best to uphold
his legacy of inquiry...</i>

31
00:01:29,231 --> 00:01:32,222
Here's hoping something comes
of Mr. Brody's paper-making project.

32
00:01:36,371 --> 00:01:37,998
<i>Now, please help me welcome...</i>

33
00:01:38,072 --> 00:01:39,629
How many times have you watched that?

34
00:01:39,706 --> 00:01:41,469
<i>Two-term mayor...</i>

35
00:01:42,643 --> 00:01:43,837
There's no TV.

36
00:01:44,111 --> 00:01:47,342
Look, really, Eli, if you've nothing better
to do, there's far more important things...

37
00:01:47,414 --> 00:01:49,813
I'm adding this footage
to my documentary.

38
00:01:49,882 --> 00:01:51,076
I think it's important.

39
00:01:51,617 --> 00:01:53,175
Oh, yeah, why's that, then?

40
00:01:54,387 --> 00:01:55,684
They're our descendants.

41
00:01:55,755 --> 00:01:57,382
Not mine. I wasn't there.

42
00:01:58,324 --> 00:02:00,018
Okay, they're still us.

43
00:02:01,927 --> 00:02:02,951
Humans?

44
00:02:03,828 --> 00:02:05,762
I just wish they hadn't all left.

45
00:02:06,264 --> 00:02:09,597
I kind of liked the idea of
having new faces around.

46
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,328
Oh, yeah?

47
00:02:11,869 --> 00:02:13,894
Well, if they really did spread
all over the galaxy,

48
00:02:13,971 --> 00:02:17,236
I would suggest that the chances
of bumping into them again are pretty high.

49
00:02:19,276 --> 00:02:21,869
Plus, this isn't a passenger ship.

50
00:02:37,092 --> 00:02:38,184
What's this?

51
00:02:38,727 --> 00:02:39,751
It's a gas giant.

52
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,227
<i>For some reason, Destiny's decided
to maneuver around a fat gas giant</i>

53
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:44,525
in order to line up with the star.

54
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,599
What's that about?

55
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,965
<i>Well, I'm sure Destiny has its reasons.
It's happened before.</i>

56
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:51,329
Yeah, but it takes forever.

57
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:52,871
Are you in a hurry to be somewhere?

58
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,506
Well, no, but power reserves
are still at 40%.

59
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,304
It's as bad as my grandfather.

60
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,202
He was always filling his Buick
at half a tank.

61
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,872
Destiny's kind of doing the same thing.

62
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,047
It just struck me as funny.

63
00:03:06,118 --> 00:03:07,107
Oh, yeah, that is funny.

64
00:03:07,753 --> 00:03:09,414
That his life
and the lives of those around him

65
00:03:09,488 --> 00:03:11,011
depended on making it
to the next gas station.

66
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:12,647
That's bloody hilarious, really.

67
00:03:13,891 --> 00:03:15,017
We there yet?

68
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,350
Thirty seconds from contact.

69
00:03:20,264 --> 00:03:23,131
This is Young. We are about to
perform an aero-braking maneuver.

70
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,134
There may be turbulence. Stand by.

71
00:03:27,771 --> 00:03:29,329
- Good morning.
- Morning.

72
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:30,971
- You good?
- Tired.

73
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,823
We've got drones, dead ahead,
a ton of them!

74
00:03:54,895 --> 00:03:56,863
- And a command ship.
- What the hell are they doing here?

75
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,693
Coming right at us.

76
00:04:23,988 --> 00:04:25,216
Where did they come from?

77
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:26,449
Maybe they were here all along

78
00:04:26,524 --> 00:04:27,718
and we couldn't see them
from behind the planet.

79
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:30,555
Still have a couple of minutes or so
before we can safely go back into FTL.

80
00:04:30,727 --> 00:04:32,957
- How soon will they be on top of us?
- A couple minutes.

81
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:34,462
Lieutenant, let's see
if we can get around them.

82
00:04:34,531 --> 00:04:35,589
Yes, sir.

83
00:04:42,037 --> 00:04:43,732
Sir, the swarm of drones
and the command ship

84
00:04:43,806 --> 00:04:45,899
are maneuvering to stay
between us and the star.

85
00:04:45,974 --> 00:04:46,998
Unless you want to head right at them...

86
00:04:47,076 --> 00:04:49,442
- That is a negative. Where the hell is...
How many of them are there?

87
00:04:49,545 --> 00:04:51,910
Oh, I don't know.
I lost count at about 100.

88
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:53,674
- Can we jam them?
- Drones are 30 seconds out.

89
00:04:53,748 --> 00:04:54,942
I can't jam them in 30 seconds.

90
00:04:55,016 --> 00:04:56,074
Doesn't matter, we can jump soon.

91
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,277
We should just punch through.
They won't follow us into the star.

92
00:04:58,353 --> 00:04:59,820
- We're never going to make it.
- We need to refuel.

93
00:04:59,887 --> 00:05:01,285
<i>Well, Destiny can
choose another star.</i>

94
00:05:01,355 --> 00:05:02,788
There's no point in fighting
unless we have to.

95
00:05:02,856 --> 00:05:04,050
Ten seconds to contact.

96
00:05:04,124 --> 00:05:06,558
- Lieutenant, go to FTL.
Not for another 15 seconds.

97
00:05:06,626 --> 00:05:09,151
- How is that not close enough?
They're firing.

98
00:05:16,335 --> 00:05:18,303
- Five seconds.
- Lieutenant, stand by.

99
00:05:18,371 --> 00:05:22,067
Yes, sir. FTL in three, two, one.

100
00:05:30,014 --> 00:05:32,311
This is Young. We are clear of the drones.

101
00:05:34,218 --> 00:05:35,913
Okay, what the hell was that?

102
00:05:35,986 --> 00:05:37,851
It's like they were lying in wait.

103
00:05:38,122 --> 00:05:39,487
Could be we just got unlucky.

104
00:05:39,556 --> 00:05:41,045
You mean they just happened to be here?

105
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,451
Well, they have to be somewhere.

106
00:05:42,525 --> 00:05:45,653
Yeah, but space is really, really big.

107
00:05:45,995 --> 00:05:47,758
Look, as far as we know,
they can only track us

108
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:51,629
when we activate the stargate,
so, please, let's not overreact.

109
00:05:55,103 --> 00:05:57,936
How about let's not under-react?

110
00:06:11,184 --> 00:06:13,744
You don't really think
it was a coincidence.

111
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,310
Call it wishful thinking if you like.

112
00:06:15,388 --> 00:06:18,016
Because you realize
if it's not a coincidence...

113
00:06:18,091 --> 00:06:20,150
Then we have a very big problem.

114
00:06:20,226 --> 00:06:24,559
No. No, no, no, we're totally screwed.
This could be it, the end of the line.

115
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,154
Yeah, I just said that.

116
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,327
So why do we need to find another star?

117
00:06:30,402 --> 00:06:33,268
<i>Destiny will just fly towards
the nearest red dwarf in our path.</i>

118
00:06:33,337 --> 00:06:36,170
Which is exactly why
we shouldn't go to that one.

119
00:06:37,642 --> 00:06:39,769
You think they were waiting for us.

120
00:06:40,111 --> 00:06:41,543
Look, we know they can't track us,

121
00:06:41,611 --> 00:06:43,943
but it is possible that they
can predict our course.

122
00:06:44,014 --> 00:06:46,949
<i>Meaning, if Destiny hadn't plotted
that time-consuming maneuver...</i>

123
00:06:47,017 --> 00:06:48,951
We would've had to fight it out
for the whole three hours

124
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:50,043
before we could go to FTL.

125
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,814
Or be forced to jump prematurely.

126
00:06:51,887 --> 00:06:53,878
Which would have shredded our FTL drive...

127
00:06:55,925 --> 00:06:56,914
We got lucky.

128
00:06:57,393 --> 00:07:00,419
Yeah, we did, but we can't
count on luck a second time.

129
00:07:00,496 --> 00:07:05,990
Plus, we've no option but to recharge,
so we go off the path.

130
00:07:15,876 --> 00:07:16,865
Contacts?

131
00:07:17,277 --> 00:07:18,539
Nothing yet.

132
00:07:18,612 --> 00:07:21,239
We're too far out from the primary
for sensors to pick anything up.

133
00:07:21,314 --> 00:07:22,781
I wouldn't celebrate.

134
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:25,044
Why did we drop out so far away?

135
00:07:25,485 --> 00:07:29,012
To make sure that the minimum time
elapsed before we could go back to FTL.

136
00:07:29,388 --> 00:07:31,150
Don't want to run into drones
with time on the clock.

137
00:07:32,324 --> 00:07:35,191
I still don't understand what
they want from us.

138
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,922
It's nothing personal.
It's what they're programmed to do.

139
00:07:37,996 --> 00:07:40,157
Destroy all technology
other than their own,

140
00:07:40,232 --> 00:07:42,597
and apparently,
they weren't programmed to give up.

141
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:44,700
A few seconds away from FTL
capability, sir.

142
00:07:44,935 --> 00:07:46,061
Copy that.

143
00:07:46,437 --> 00:07:47,563
So far so good.

144
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:50,634
This room needs more chairs.

145
00:07:51,674 --> 00:07:53,665
Here. Please, go ahead.

146
00:07:53,743 --> 00:07:55,870
- No, no, that's your...
- What am I, Captain Kirk?

147
00:07:55,945 --> 00:07:57,936
I need to stretch my legs anyway. Please.

148
00:07:58,448 --> 00:07:59,608
Thank you.

149
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,108
Don't touch anything.

150
00:08:04,486 --> 00:08:06,750
And that's three hours.
We can jump any time now.

151
00:08:06,822 --> 00:08:08,619
- That's good.
That's huge.

152
00:08:09,024 --> 00:08:11,719
I mean, I don't want to jinx
anything but I think we might...

153
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:14,257
Sir, we've got a contact down range.

154
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:15,992
- Damn it.
- They headed our way?

155
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:18,395
Yes, sir, multiple drones,
multiple vectors.

156
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:21,934
There's a command ship, too,
holding position between us and the star.

157
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,128
It's a blockade.

158
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:24,761
How long before they reach us?
- It doesn't matter.

159
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,305
We can't fight our way through this.

160
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:28,136
Plus, we're running low on power anyway.

161
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,732
- Lieutenant, get us out of here.
Yes, sir.

162
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:38,374
So Sergeant Greer
was bang-on in his assessment.

163
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,815
The drones cannot track us,

164
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:43,251
<i>so instead they've blockaded the stars
from which Destiny recharges.</i>

165
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:45,881
They can't possibly be waiting
at every star in your path.

166
00:08:46,224 --> 00:08:48,351
It doesn't matter.
They only have to be at the next one.

167
00:08:48,626 --> 00:08:50,355
- What do you mean?
Well, our reserves are such

168
00:08:50,428 --> 00:08:51,792
that we're only going
to get one more chance.

169
00:08:51,862 --> 00:08:54,660
Systems are shutting down all over.
I just lost power in the infirmary.

170
00:08:55,766 --> 00:08:57,791
Well, fortunately, Eli has an idea.

171
00:08:58,235 --> 00:09:01,204
It's absolute insanity,
and it's the only choice we've got.

172
00:09:01,804 --> 00:09:03,567
Don't over-sell it.

173
00:09:04,307 --> 00:09:08,175
Okay, so the drones
have figured out our weakness.

174
00:09:08,878 --> 00:09:12,779
<i>Destiny needs to replenish its reserves,
and only uses certain kinds of stars to do it.</i>

175
00:09:12,847 --> 00:09:15,839
Main sequence, spectral K or M,
mostly red dwarves.

176
00:09:16,284 --> 00:09:19,276
So we recharge off another kind of star.
What's so crazy about that?

177
00:09:19,354 --> 00:09:21,515
The only way to make sure the drones
won't be waiting

178
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:25,423
<i>is to pick a star that Destiny
wouldn't fly into in a million years.</i>

179
00:09:25,492 --> 00:09:28,325
No, don't tell me. Death Star.

180
00:09:31,498 --> 00:09:32,521
Close.

181
00:09:32,732 --> 00:09:33,721
Uh...

182
00:09:34,901 --> 00:09:36,528
A blue supergiant.

183
00:09:38,571 --> 00:09:39,902
Are you kidding me?

184
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:41,930
We said it was crazy.

185
00:09:42,007 --> 00:09:43,838
Yeah, it's crazy times a thousand!

186
00:09:43,909 --> 00:09:47,003
Do you have any idea how much heat
a Class O star puts out?

187
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:50,113
I'm telling you right now,
we can't survive something like that.

188
00:09:50,182 --> 00:09:51,672
And I never said we would.

189
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:54,342
Well, then, I think it's a very bad plan.

190
00:09:54,418 --> 00:09:56,852
The shields will hold...
Yeah, which is terrific, Eli,

191
00:09:56,921 --> 00:09:58,786
except the temperatures
we're talking about

192
00:09:58,856 --> 00:10:02,188
<i>are way outside Destiny's
life support margins.</i>

193
00:10:02,258 --> 00:10:04,351
A few compartments are going to get
over 400 degrees.

194
00:10:04,427 --> 00:10:08,864
Which is why the majority of the crew
will go to a planet within range,

195
00:10:08,932 --> 00:10:11,492
and a team will stay behind
to manually pilot the ship through.

196
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,391
Why not just program the ship to do it,
and all of you can go?

197
00:10:14,937 --> 00:10:18,373
<i>Because even if Destiny
accepted the program, which I doubt,</i>

198
00:10:18,907 --> 00:10:22,364
the core systems would shut themselves
down because of the temperature.

199
00:10:22,443 --> 00:10:23,740
Somebody's got to stay on board.

200
00:10:24,912 --> 00:10:26,971
And just who gets to decide that?

201
00:10:27,048 --> 00:10:31,280
We use the communication stones
and get the most qualified people aboard.

202
00:10:31,352 --> 00:10:33,114
The most qualified people
are already on board.

203
00:10:33,186 --> 00:10:34,483
That's myself and Eli.

204
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:35,915
You're volunteering for this?

205
00:10:38,992 --> 00:10:43,587
This is our own lives that are on the line.
You're not even bloody here.

206
00:10:46,065 --> 00:10:47,498
But those kind of temperatures...

207
00:10:47,566 --> 00:10:48,692
The suits can handle it.

208
00:10:49,135 --> 00:10:50,534
It won't be comfortable, but, yeah.

209
00:10:51,804 --> 00:10:55,432
Wait, how do we know there'll be a planet
orbiting this star you're talking about?

210
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,867
Well, there won't be,
certainly not a habitable one.

211
00:10:58,376 --> 00:11:01,971
But we think there will be at least one
or two stargates in nearby star systems.

212
00:11:02,346 --> 00:11:05,144
Won't an active stargate attract drones
to the planet we go to?

213
00:11:05,215 --> 00:11:07,979
- Eventually, yeah.
- But hopefully not before we can gate back.

214
00:11:08,052 --> 00:11:09,144
Hopefully not.

215
00:11:09,653 --> 00:11:12,143
Are we sure the drones won't
expect us to try this?

216
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,916
It's crazy times a thousand.

217
00:11:14,323 --> 00:11:17,019
I take it back, Eli. It's a great plan.

218
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,661
Okay, guys,
I'll try to sell this idea to homeworld,

219
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,095
- but I'm telling you right now...
- David, we're not asking permission.

220
00:11:23,165 --> 00:11:26,692
We're informing you. We're low on power,
and we don't have time to screw around.

221
00:11:27,235 --> 00:11:28,634
We're doing this.

222
00:11:36,711 --> 00:11:41,148
If we keep them on the vine,
we could have smoking sundried tomatoes.

223
00:11:41,215 --> 00:11:44,206
Smoking, all right. Every plant in here
is going to burn to the ground.

224
00:11:44,451 --> 00:11:46,419
Well, don't ask me why
that doesn't happen every time.

225
00:11:46,486 --> 00:11:49,819
Well, the EM of a Class O star
is just too intense for the shield

226
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:53,016
to attenuate over such
a large transparent surface.

227
00:11:53,659 --> 00:11:56,389
I'm guessing the observation deck
is not the place to be, either.

228
00:11:56,695 --> 00:11:58,128
It'll be like an oven in there, too,

229
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:02,061
but Brody is working on refrigerating
our original hydroponics compartment

230
00:12:02,134 --> 00:12:03,657
so there'll be plants to start over.

231
00:12:04,068 --> 00:12:07,799
Start over. Just when we were on
the verge of being able to feed ourselves.

232
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:10,507
If we just had a little more time.

233
00:12:10,575 --> 00:12:15,273
<i>Destiny drops out in 20 minutes,
we gate off the ship 10 minutes after that.</i>

234
00:12:15,345 --> 00:12:18,109
Save what you can, cross your fingers.

235
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:26,019
<i>This is Young. All personnel
to the Gate Room for evacuation.</i>

236
00:12:26,088 --> 00:12:28,215
<i>Pack light, you will
not be gone long.</i>

237
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,125
- Did you do that?
- No.

238
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,427
Come on.

239
00:12:53,846 --> 00:12:55,404
Colonel, the bridge just locked down.

240
00:12:56,783 --> 00:12:59,115
Understood! Head to the Gate Room.

241
00:12:59,485 --> 00:13:02,885
I hope we don't have to use any bullets.
We're running low.

242
00:13:03,221 --> 00:13:04,848
Brody'll have to make some new ones.

243
00:13:04,923 --> 00:13:06,049
That's time, sir.

244
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,096
- Colonel!
- You should be in the Gate Room.

245
00:13:13,164 --> 00:13:15,189
There's a third suit.
We should take advantage of it.

246
00:13:15,266 --> 00:13:16,255
Well, Rush said he and Eli...

247
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,699
Yeah, there's new hybrids in the dome
we could lose forever.

248
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:21,761
Medicinals that might help T.J.
From worlds we'll never go back to.

249
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,396
Well, that whole compartment's
going to go up in flames.

250
00:13:23,473 --> 00:13:26,533
You have to gate off the ship
while we still have the power to dial out.

251
00:13:26,609 --> 00:13:29,305
That leaves more than enough time
to collect as many as I can,

252
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:31,108
then back up Rush and Eli.

253
00:13:31,648 --> 00:13:33,205
- Okay.
- 'Cause Rush isn't as great as he thinks.

254
00:13:33,448 --> 00:13:35,279
And besides, I'm our expert on the suits.

255
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,341
I said okay. Good luck.

256
00:13:37,786 --> 00:13:38,878
Okay.

257
00:13:46,127 --> 00:13:47,958
- Everyone here?
- Except Rush.

258
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:50,829
- Nice of him to see us off.
- And Dr. Park.

259
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:53,823
- What?
- She volunteered to use the third suit.

260
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,666
Didn't even try to talk her out of it.
She can handle herself.

261
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:01,106
FTL drop-out in three, two...

262
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:11,614
This is Rush.
We're on direct approach to a Class O star,

263
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,207
roughly 24 solar masses.

264
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:14,947
No drones in sight.

265
00:14:15,186 --> 00:14:16,585
That's good. What's our clock?

266
00:14:16,654 --> 00:14:20,021
I can't give you a precise time on that.
To be safe, no less than seven hours.

267
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:23,316
Understood, stand by. Gates in range?

268
00:14:24,461 --> 00:14:25,792
We got one.

269
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,995
I'll take it. Dial it up.

270
00:15:13,972 --> 00:15:15,837
Holy crap, we dialed Pittsburgh.

271
00:15:18,777 --> 00:15:20,142
Atmosphere and temperature's good.

272
00:15:20,245 --> 00:15:21,576
It looks like a human city, all right.

273
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:24,340
The archive said our people
spread out from Novus for centuries.

274
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:28,249
That's enough time for dozens of planets
to be settled with large populations.

275
00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:30,184
They don't seem as advanced.

276
00:15:30,354 --> 00:15:32,822
Depending on resources,
ideology, isolation,

277
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,117
they'd all advance at different rates.

278
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,919
This has to be one of them.

279
00:15:36,192 --> 00:15:39,855
Make that "used to be." Looks abandoned.
I'm not seeing any indication of life.

280
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,194
Well, we'll find out when we get there.
Lieutenant, move us out.

281
00:15:43,099 --> 00:15:45,032
All right, people, let's go!

282
00:15:57,011 --> 00:15:59,479
Hey, crazy or not, it's a hell of a plan.

283
00:16:00,882 --> 00:16:02,281
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

284
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,743
I should go suit up, help Lisa in the dome.

285
00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:07,844
I'll see you sometime after 0700.

286
00:16:07,921 --> 00:16:10,685
Ish! We'll dial when it's cool enough
to come back.

287
00:16:27,238 --> 00:16:30,298
All right, people, let's
find a spot and relax.

288
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,933
We're going to be here for a while.

289
00:16:34,211 --> 00:16:36,111
Well, my gut says to stay put
and wait it out,

290
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,671
but this could be a gold mine.
What do you guys think?

291
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:39,841
Cities have hospitals.

292
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:41,316
I've been washing bandages for months.

293
00:16:41,385 --> 00:16:42,682
If we could even find a pharmacy...

294
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:45,050
- Or a grocery store.
- Or a gun store.

295
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:47,783
Thing is, these people left for a reason.
We don't know what.

296
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:49,851
Have you ever been to Pittsburgh?

297
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,757
Hey! I was born there.

298
00:16:54,997 --> 00:16:56,487
I think it's worth the risk.

299
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:00,300
All right. We'll go out in small teams,
light armaments.

300
00:17:00,369 --> 00:17:02,769
- Yes, sir.
- Wait, shouldn't we all go?

301
00:17:02,838 --> 00:17:04,168
We'd cover more ground that way, sir.

302
00:17:04,238 --> 00:17:05,830
This already goes against
my better judgment.

303
00:17:05,906 --> 00:17:09,034
I want you two to stay put, and you keep
these people safe, understood?

304
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,099
Yes, sir.

305
00:17:10,211 --> 00:17:11,269
- Colonel...
You, too.

306
00:17:11,345 --> 00:17:13,506
Could hit the fan in here just
as easily as out there.

307
00:17:13,581 --> 00:17:15,070
If we are not back in seven hours,

308
00:17:15,148 --> 00:17:16,479
I want you to get everyone
back on the ship.

309
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:18,380
No search teams, no waiting, okay?

310
00:17:19,285 --> 00:17:21,378
Anything in particular
you want me to look for?

311
00:17:22,255 --> 00:17:23,654
I'd kill for a new outfit.

312
00:17:24,757 --> 00:17:26,054
I'll keep that in mind.

313
00:17:26,925 --> 00:17:28,415
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

314
00:17:44,574 --> 00:17:46,474
We'll head this way. Be smart.

315
00:17:46,543 --> 00:17:47,840
Yes, sir.

316
00:17:58,154 --> 00:17:59,519
This was a good idea.

317
00:17:59,588 --> 00:18:02,148
Yeah, I just wanted to grab as
many as we can, you know?

318
00:18:02,825 --> 00:18:04,815
In some ways, this garden
was our biggest accomplishment.

319
00:18:04,893 --> 00:18:06,383
You mean besides the still?

320
00:18:06,728 --> 00:18:08,923
I mean, besides staying alive.

321
00:18:09,864 --> 00:18:14,425
You know, I come here a lot
just to think ever since it got repaired.

322
00:18:14,501 --> 00:18:18,232
You know when you lay down on
the ground and you look up at the stars?

323
00:18:19,273 --> 00:18:22,572
My father and I used to do that
a lot when I was a kid.

324
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,542
He taught me all the constellations.

325
00:18:25,044 --> 00:18:26,841
These stars are always changing.

326
00:18:28,081 --> 00:18:29,173
<i>Eli,
what are you doing?</i>

327
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:34,183
Helping Dr. Park?

328
00:18:34,252 --> 00:18:36,277
<i>Well, time to stop doing that.
Rush out.</i>

329
00:18:43,228 --> 00:18:45,320
Don't leave me alone with him
too long, please?

330
00:18:45,963 --> 00:18:47,954
I'm just going to grab a few more.
I'll be right behind you.

331
00:19:10,085 --> 00:19:12,315
I wonder
how long they've been gone.

332
00:19:13,188 --> 00:19:16,953
It's hard to say.
Nature can reclaim a city pretty fast.

333
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:19,258
Years, at least.

334
00:19:19,327 --> 00:19:22,854
They were just like us,
and we never knew them.

335
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,159
What I can't figure out
is why there's no vehicles.

336
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,592
Don't waste time searching
stores or buildings

337
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:29,794
that don't have anything useful in them.

338
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:32,228
If we see a shoe
store, I'm going in.

339
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:33,772
New boots would be useful.

340
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:37,067
- Lieutenant!
- Yeah?

341
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:39,634
We should split up,
go on opposite sides of the street.

342
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:41,339
We'll cover more ground.

343
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:46,247
Yeah, good idea.
Brody, Chloe and you two, you're with me.

344
00:20:05,501 --> 00:20:07,332
You're not wearing your suit.

345
00:20:07,403 --> 00:20:09,303
Well, there's plenty of time
before we reach the star.

346
00:20:09,372 --> 00:20:11,340
Plus, we can work better without them.

347
00:20:11,641 --> 00:20:13,632
Yeah, but now I look ridiculous.

348
00:20:15,477 --> 00:20:16,466
Yeah.

349
00:20:16,978 --> 00:20:19,742
Will you double-check these figures for me?

350
00:20:21,316 --> 00:20:22,613
Then what?

351
00:20:22,684 --> 00:20:23,912
Well, it's your plan, you tell me.

352
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:26,614
I know that, I was just asking.

353
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,912
So was I.

354
00:20:29,256 --> 00:20:30,280
I asked first.

355
00:20:31,225 --> 00:20:34,625
Eli, both of us have to know
exactly what we're doing here.

356
00:20:34,694 --> 00:20:36,457
There's no room for improvisation.

357
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,396
If we get this wrong,
we've got a very big problem.

358
00:20:39,465 --> 00:20:40,625
Yeah, we'll be dead.

359
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,567
Which I find problematic,
so how do you want to do this?

360
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,759
I don't understand the question.

361
00:20:45,837 --> 00:20:47,634
Oh, bloody hell, we're all doomed.

362
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:50,698
What! We pilot the ship manually
through the star.

363
00:20:50,776 --> 00:20:52,266
- That's the plan.
- Who is going to be the pilot,

364
00:20:52,344 --> 00:20:54,641
and who is going to be the co-pilot?

365
00:20:55,479 --> 00:20:56,844
I just assumed...

366
00:20:56,914 --> 00:20:58,882
Look, there's no question that in the end

367
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,441
that it's going to take both of us
to pull this off,

368
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:04,181
but only one of us should input
the actual course corrections.

369
00:21:04,255 --> 00:21:06,916
I'm trying to determine who that should be.

370
00:21:11,394 --> 00:21:14,090
Okay. I'll do it.

371
00:21:15,898 --> 00:21:19,231
There. That wasn't so hard, was it?

372
00:21:23,572 --> 00:21:25,630
Now double-check those figures for me.

373
00:21:55,133 --> 00:21:56,600
Rush, this is Park.

374
00:21:57,569 --> 00:22:00,163
<i>- Yeah, go ahead.
- Destiny's locked down this compartment.</i>

375
00:22:00,238 --> 00:22:01,728
I need you to override the door.

376
00:22:02,374 --> 00:22:03,500
I'm on it!

377
00:22:14,984 --> 00:22:16,110
It's not working.

378
00:22:30,465 --> 00:22:31,830
Look what I found.

379
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:39,766
All the labels are worn off.

380
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,330
We don't know what's in them,
or how old they are...

381
00:22:41,409 --> 00:22:44,003
We'll find out when we open them, okay?

382
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:47,068
Mmm.

383
00:22:48,048 --> 00:22:49,413
Botulism.

384
00:22:57,856 --> 00:23:00,154
The sun is fading. It'll be dark soon.

385
00:23:00,225 --> 00:23:01,317
Six hours to go.

386
00:23:02,895 --> 00:23:05,658
Check this out. I found it over there.

387
00:23:05,963 --> 00:23:08,193
- Looks like a newspaper.
- Look at the headline.

388
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:30,443
This is Young.
I found a decent vantage point of the city.

389
00:23:31,153 --> 00:23:34,350
It wasn't abandoned.
These people were wiped out.

390
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,921
We're about halfway across town,
sir. You want us to head back to the gate?

391
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:48,461
No, not yet. We have no idea how long ago
this happened, or who did it.

392
00:23:48,535 --> 00:23:50,196
Hopefully they're long gone.

393
00:23:51,004 --> 00:23:52,904
<i>Just keep searching for supplies.</i>

394
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,271
Yes, sir. Greer, did you copy that?

395
00:23:55,742 --> 00:23:59,439
Yeah, keep shopping. Keep shopping.

396
00:24:06,284 --> 00:24:08,013
I'm getting the gist of this.

397
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,220
I think they're saying that
the attack came from space,

398
00:24:11,289 --> 00:24:14,019
some kind of machines that
went after their technology first.

399
00:24:14,593 --> 00:24:16,219
Hey, what does that sound like to you?

400
00:24:16,293 --> 00:24:18,761
I don't know, Morrison,
but just keep it down.

401
00:24:18,829 --> 00:24:20,626
What? Don't you think these people
have a right to know

402
00:24:20,698 --> 00:24:21,995
what they might be up against?

403
00:24:22,066 --> 00:24:24,728
What I think is, you need to stay calm.

404
00:24:26,436 --> 00:24:28,028
Give it to me.

405
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,306
What are you doing?

406
00:24:39,381 --> 00:24:43,784
The Colonel asked me to keep these
people safe, so that's what I'm doing.

407
00:24:48,256 --> 00:24:51,316
What kind of city doesn't have a gun shop?

408
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:53,290
Maybe they're Canadian.

409
00:24:57,898 --> 00:24:58,990
What?

410
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:01,856
Listen.

411
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:04,566
Greer, do you hear that?

412
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,400
- I don't hear anything.
- Shut up!

413
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:11,268
Let's get inside!

414
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,074
Come on, come on, come on.
In here. Go, go!

415
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:17,774
Get in here, get inside,
get inside, get inside. Go, go, go, go!

416
00:25:17,982 --> 00:25:19,142
Go! Go!

417
00:25:30,494 --> 00:25:31,518
Lieutenant?

418
00:25:32,296 --> 00:25:33,695
I hear it, but I can't see it.

419
00:25:41,971 --> 00:25:44,166
Colonel, we have what appears
to be a single drone at our position.

420
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,673
Request permission to engage.

421
00:25:46,341 --> 00:25:48,707
That's a negative!
We don't know how many there are.

422
00:25:48,777 --> 00:25:51,769
Go to radio silence.
Do not reveal your position.

423
00:25:51,847 --> 00:25:52,836
Young out.

424
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:20,026
Guys?

425
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:23,433
<i>Destiny's closed off the compartment
from the rest of the ship,</i>

426
00:26:23,509 --> 00:26:26,500
and for some reason we don't understand
is refusing our override command.

427
00:26:26,577 --> 00:26:28,408
We're working on it, but in the meantime,

428
00:26:28,479 --> 00:26:29,639
you should put the rest of your suit on.

429
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:32,478
We're only a few minutes out.
It's gonna start getting pretty hot in here.

430
00:26:33,251 --> 00:26:34,240
Okay.

431
00:26:36,987 --> 00:26:39,820
- We don't have time for this.
- It was a good idea.

432
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,687
Yeah, well, maybe it was,
but she took too long,

433
00:26:41,758 --> 00:26:43,953
and now she could end up paying the price.

434
00:26:51,967 --> 00:26:53,161
- Hey.
- Hey.

435
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,328
Success?

436
00:26:55,871 --> 00:26:58,634
The hospital's probably
in the part of the city that was taken out.

437
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,301
We found what passed for a pharmacy.
Mostly cleaned out, but...

438
00:27:01,376 --> 00:27:02,900
Why don't you take what
you've got back to the gate.

439
00:27:02,977 --> 00:27:04,842
- It's gonna be dark soon.
- What about Scott and Greer's team?

440
00:27:04,913 --> 00:27:07,244
I'll worry about them. You guys get going.

441
00:27:20,026 --> 00:27:21,050
What's it doing?

442
00:27:22,628 --> 00:27:24,858
I'm not sure. I think it knows we're here.

443
00:27:25,031 --> 00:27:27,863
- Are you sure there's only one?
- One too many.

444
00:27:33,772 --> 00:27:36,138
Give me a can. Give me a can.

445
00:28:03,165 --> 00:28:07,692
Guys? You haven't forgotten
about me, have you?

446
00:28:08,369 --> 00:28:09,927
We're still working on it.

447
00:28:10,004 --> 00:28:12,495
<i>That's the second time Destiny's
tried to abort our approach,</i>

448
00:28:12,573 --> 00:28:14,131
and the second time I've
had to override it.

449
00:28:14,475 --> 00:28:16,772
If it lets you do that,
why won't it let us open that damn door?

450
00:28:16,843 --> 00:28:18,310
I don't understand that, either.

451
00:28:20,046 --> 00:28:23,447
That's it. I'm going down there
to try to pry the door open.

452
00:28:26,652 --> 00:28:28,586
Dr. Park, this is Rush, can you hear me?

453
00:28:28,654 --> 00:28:29,746
Yeah, I'm still here.

454
00:28:30,055 --> 00:28:31,283
Now, listen very carefully.

455
00:28:33,058 --> 00:28:36,686
Eli is spending more time and energy
on your predicament than we can afford.

456
00:28:37,328 --> 00:28:38,488
Well, thank you, Eli!

457
00:28:38,563 --> 00:28:39,587
<i>No, no, no, you don't understand.</i>

458
00:28:39,664 --> 00:28:42,997
The point is Eli has to stop
worrying about you

459
00:28:43,067 --> 00:28:46,059
and start worrying about the more
important task of flying this ship.

460
00:28:46,703 --> 00:28:48,295
You're what's important!
Don't listen to him...

461
00:28:48,372 --> 00:28:49,839
You're wearing the EVA suit.

462
00:28:49,906 --> 00:28:53,000
That should provide you with
enough protection even inside the dome.

463
00:28:53,076 --> 00:28:54,236
You know that better than me.

464
00:28:54,878 --> 00:28:58,313
You want me to stay in here?
What about the plants I saved?

465
00:28:58,381 --> 00:29:02,112
Dr. Park, forget about the plants
and please listen to me very carefully.

466
00:29:03,052 --> 00:29:05,384
There's a collection pool
near the center of the compartment.

467
00:29:06,222 --> 00:29:08,416
<i>As long as you're fully
immersed and secure</i>

468
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,653
during the transition through the star
then the water should provide

469
00:29:11,726 --> 00:29:13,250
enough protection to see you through.

470
00:29:13,895 --> 00:29:15,795
Do you really think that's going to work?

471
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:18,222
I promise you it will.

472
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,225
Look, I'm sorry,
but there's really no other way.

473
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,666
Rush out.

474
00:29:25,606 --> 00:29:27,368
Son of a bitch.

475
00:29:30,209 --> 00:29:31,676
She'll be fine.

476
00:29:53,431 --> 00:29:56,264
It was probably drawn in
by the stargate activation at first.

477
00:29:56,933 --> 00:29:58,400
Then it picked up our radio signals.

478
00:29:58,468 --> 00:30:00,800
Whatever. We can't stay.

479
00:30:01,771 --> 00:30:03,500
Sooner or later, we've got to make a move.

480
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,229
Listen!

481
00:30:15,751 --> 00:30:19,379
Do you hear that? They're coming!

482
00:30:20,588 --> 00:30:23,489
Everybody stay still and stay quiet.

483
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,562
There's two of them out there now.

484
00:30:34,768 --> 00:30:37,167
Bet there's a lot more left
over after the attack.

485
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,060
Probably scattered all over the planet.

486
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:42,039
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know, but...

487
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:50,479
Okay, it's made the Lieutenant's position.

488
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,980
When I start firing, you run.

489
00:31:17,539 --> 00:31:19,029
- What are you doing?
- This thing is showing

490
00:31:19,107 --> 00:31:20,438
two other planets in range.

491
00:31:20,509 --> 00:31:23,000
<i>Yeah, but only this one's
in range of Destiny.</i>

492
00:31:23,078 --> 00:31:25,512
Well, I'm not going to sit around here
waiting to get killed.

493
00:31:26,982 --> 00:31:28,608
Hey! What are you doing?

494
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,644
Getting the hell...

495
00:31:39,526 --> 00:31:41,892
This is James.
Morrison tried dialing the stargate,

496
00:31:41,961 --> 00:31:43,189
but I think I stopped him in time.

497
00:31:43,263 --> 00:31:45,754
Negative, negative.
One of the drones is now headed your way.

498
00:31:45,832 --> 00:31:46,821
Stay off your radio and...

499
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:10,208
Get out of there!

500
00:32:49,188 --> 00:32:51,452
- Thanks for the backup, sir.
- All good.

501
00:32:55,061 --> 00:32:57,256
Come on, we should get out of the open.

502
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,266
- You found something?
Let's move!

503
00:33:16,547 --> 00:33:19,811
I get it, you don't want to do this!
Can we shut that off, please?

504
00:33:22,886 --> 00:33:24,046
Thank you.

505
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,714
Navigation systems are beginning
to shut themselves down.

506
00:33:28,023 --> 00:33:29,547
You now have full manual control.

507
00:33:30,492 --> 00:33:32,483
Got it. Our approach is good.

508
00:33:37,965 --> 00:33:42,129
Mean interior temperature just passed
150 degrees Fahrenheit and rising.

509
00:33:42,236 --> 00:33:44,431
<i>What if Destiny locked down
that compartment</i>

510
00:33:44,505 --> 00:33:47,167
and wouldn't let us override
because it knew that the dome

511
00:33:47,241 --> 00:33:49,708
couldn't sustain the stress
of going through the star?

512
00:33:52,612 --> 00:33:53,806
You already thought of that.

513
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,711
I considered the possibility, yes.

514
00:33:56,082 --> 00:33:57,310
You told her she'd be fine.

515
00:33:57,384 --> 00:34:00,750
And I still believe that,
but only if you do what you're here to do

516
00:34:00,819 --> 00:34:03,185
and stop worrying about something
you can do nothing about!

517
00:34:09,027 --> 00:34:10,221
Damn!

518
00:34:17,335 --> 00:34:18,961
All right, let's go.

519
00:34:50,597 --> 00:34:53,293
This is James.
We've got a drone at the front door.

520
00:34:54,101 --> 00:34:56,194
Damn it, L.T.
, I said to stay off your radio.

521
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,067
<i>They are drawn to the signal!</i>

522
00:34:58,438 --> 00:35:00,463
Yes, sir. I'm counting on it.

523
00:35:25,696 --> 00:35:28,096
- Nice shot.
- Thank you.

524
00:35:29,165 --> 00:35:31,429
- Anyone hurt?
Yeah, Morrison.

525
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,196
I broke his nose.

526
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:24,414
Okay, we're in the star!

527
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:27,645
Shields are holding. Activating collectors.

528
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:29,911
We're going in too steep.

529
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,183
Variance is nominal, you're doing fine.

530
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:35,191
The magnetic fluctuations are
way greater than I predicted.

531
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:37,227
- I'm not sure I can stay ahead of it.
- You can do this.

532
00:36:37,294 --> 00:36:38,726
I don't know why I ever thought I could!

533
00:36:38,795 --> 00:36:40,558
- I know you can.
- There are too many variables!

534
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:43,030
Eli! You're the only one who can!

535
00:36:59,313 --> 00:37:01,713
Sure this is the right way, sir?
It's a shortcut.

536
00:37:01,782 --> 00:37:03,716
Are you sure?
It's the one I took to find you.

537
00:37:03,784 --> 00:37:04,944
Yes, I'm sure.

538
00:37:12,525 --> 00:37:14,516
Reserves are at maximum capacity.

539
00:37:15,261 --> 00:37:16,558
Retracting collectors.

540
00:37:17,163 --> 00:37:19,426
We're pulling out,
entering the photosphere.

541
00:37:20,332 --> 00:37:22,892
Sub-light drives are at full power!

542
00:37:23,402 --> 00:37:25,267
- We've done it!
- Almost.

543
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:52,689
We did it. We made it through.

544
00:37:52,761 --> 00:37:56,629
Mean interior temperature, 310 degrees.

545
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:59,128
Oh, is that all?

546
00:38:00,201 --> 00:38:02,362
I should start cooling the Gate Room first.

547
00:38:02,971 --> 00:38:04,029
They could be back...

548
00:38:09,109 --> 00:38:11,634
- What?
- The hydroponic dome's been breached.

549
00:38:14,748 --> 00:38:15,806
Eli!

550
00:38:16,283 --> 00:38:18,478
This was printed on the third day
of the attack.

551
00:38:18,919 --> 00:38:21,944
The plan was to move the stargate
from a place they called Terminus

552
00:38:22,021 --> 00:38:24,512
to an older part of the city. I guess here.

553
00:38:24,924 --> 00:38:26,186
No technology to attract them.

554
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:29,586
From what I can make out,
volunteers were driving vehicles

555
00:38:29,661 --> 00:38:32,221
away from the city to draw the drones.

556
00:38:33,198 --> 00:38:34,893
Save as many people as they could.

557
00:38:38,136 --> 00:38:39,898
Sir, welcome back.

558
00:38:40,137 --> 00:38:41,468
Nice work, Lieutenant.

559
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:43,438
Varro's the one who fired the shot.

560
00:38:44,708 --> 00:38:47,370
Well, let's just get out of here before
more show up.

561
00:38:47,444 --> 00:38:48,775
Half hour to go.

562
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,407
How is that not close enough?

563
00:38:52,715 --> 00:38:53,875
What's in the bag?

564
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,713
Hopefully that is your new outfit.

565
00:38:55,785 --> 00:39:00,346
I couldn't find a gun store or a grocery
store, but I found a dry cleaner.

566
00:39:12,533 --> 00:39:15,434
Lisa, come in! Lisa, it's Eli,

567
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,601
I'm outside, can you hear me?

568
00:39:17,872 --> 00:39:20,635
I'm at the door! The compartment's vented.

569
00:39:21,908 --> 00:39:24,308
<i>- Rush, did you hear that?
- Yes, yes.</i>

570
00:39:24,711 --> 00:39:27,009
We're through the star.
I may be able to override.

571
00:39:30,015 --> 00:39:31,073
Are you secure?

572
00:39:32,151 --> 00:39:33,140
Ready!

573
00:39:35,821 --> 00:39:37,345
Take my hand!

574
00:39:55,405 --> 00:39:57,373
I got you. You're okay.

575
00:39:58,141 --> 00:40:01,871
Eli, I can't see!

576
00:40:17,092 --> 00:40:18,389
It sounds different than before.

577
00:40:18,627 --> 00:40:20,526
I don't much like the difference.

578
00:40:20,594 --> 00:40:23,222
- Dial the gate.
- No, we're 10 minutes too soon.

579
00:40:23,297 --> 00:40:24,764
Close enough!

580
00:41:21,716 --> 00:41:24,446
- It's hot in here.
- You're 10 minutes early.

581
00:41:24,786 --> 00:41:26,378
We didn't have much of a choice.

582
00:41:26,454 --> 00:41:28,888
Lieutenant Johansen, there's a patient
waiting for you in the infirmary.

583
00:41:28,956 --> 00:41:30,320
- Eli's with her now.
- What happened?

584
00:41:30,457 --> 00:41:32,925
Flash blindness. Hopefully it's temporary.

585
00:41:34,361 --> 00:41:35,385
But otherwise?

586
00:41:36,129 --> 00:41:37,460
Eli got us through.

587
00:41:38,365 --> 00:41:40,992
I kept checking his calculations
looking for a mistake,

588
00:41:41,067 --> 00:41:42,364
but there wasn't any.

589
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,334
It was genius.
I've never seen anything like it.

590
00:41:48,207 --> 00:41:51,369
- Please don't tell him I told you that.
- He might have to do it again.

591
00:41:51,443 --> 00:41:53,172
The drones aren't going to
fall for that trick again.

592
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:56,042
Plus, the star's extremely rare,
so the chance of...

593
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:58,173
So we're back to where we started.

594
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:03,077
Well, not exactly.
At least we've got a full tank of gas.

595
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:06,044
- Yay.
- Yay.

596
00:43:28,964 --> 00:43:29,953
English - US - SDH
