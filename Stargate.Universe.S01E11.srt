00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,397
RUSH: This is what Destiny intended from
the moment it entered the star system.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,155
YOUNG: We are going to survive.
We are going to make it home.

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,550
I'm telling you,
the ship came here for a reason!

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,193
RUSH: Destiny is powered
by the stars themselves.

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,435
WRAY: He and Young are
bumping heads, yes.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,829
Not sure which camp is the better choice.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,991
I don't even know what to do
with myself.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,513
I'm the last person who should be here.

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,512
RUSH: You're the wrong man
for the job, Colonel.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,832
You don't believe in the mission.

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,719
YOUNG: Neural interface?

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,429
A repository of knowledge that can be
literally downloaded into one's mind.

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,636
Do you know what a device like this
did to General O'Neill?

14
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,597
The sheer amount of information
overwhelmed him, yes.

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,715
It damn near killed him.

16
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,631
Young is not going to listen.

17
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,235
And Dr. Rush, well, like you said,
he's in no hurry to come home.

18
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,880
JOHANSEN: Well, the convulsions have
stopped, but he's completely unresponsive.

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,995
YOUNG: You just couldn't wait, could you?

20
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,433
Anyone who had access to that room

21
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,192
was under strict orders
not to sit in that chair.

22
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,952
YOUNG: You knew.
You wanted somebody there

23
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,554
because you didn't have the guts
to do it yourself!

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,234
This is obviously someone trying
to undermine the Colonel's authority.

25
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,639
We cannot let that happen.

26
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,073
Somebody's trying to frame me, Eli.

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,117
- Where's Rush?
- YOUNG: He didn't make it.

28
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,150
No headaches? Any blurry vision?

29
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,469
I'm fine.

30
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,036
- You sleeping okay?
- T.J., I'm good. I got to go.

31
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,309
Sir, you lost someone
under your command.

32
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,079
Most recently, three people.

33
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,674
Gorman, Spencer, and Rush. It happens.

34
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,758
Well, I know how much it affects you.

35
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,748
In different ways, I let them down.

36
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,877
So, if you ever want to talk about it,
I'm here.

37
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,473
- I don't.
- You should.

38
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,234
I'm sorry?

39
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,752
Like you said, you felt like
you let Sergeant Spencer down. We all do.

40
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,990
And there's been a lot going on
between you and Rush.

41
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,069
What are you saying?

42
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,469
That emotionally,
a lot has been left unresolved.

43
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,749
Another time.

44
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,759
WRAY: Colonel.

45
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,877
- Off to file your latest report back to Earth?
- That's right.

46
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,191
I'm curious about the details
you intend to provide

47
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,840
regarding the incident with Dr. Rush.

48
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,589
Exactly what happened.

49
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,909
I'm scheduled to file my report
with Earth later today,

50
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,791
and it may cast some doubt
on your version of events.

51
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,753
There were only two people
on that planet, me and Rush.

52
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,914
I'm talking about the obvious issues
between the two of you.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,310
That doesn't change anything.
Listen, if you want to accuse me,

54
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,436
you should have the guts
to come right out and accuse me.

55
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,111
I don't have proof of anything.

56
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,758
I think you just want to be in charge again.

57
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,512
I'm saying you had plenty of motive.

58
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,390
Really? Do you think that I want people
on this ship suspecting me of murder?

59
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,717
Maybe that burden is easier to bear
than actually dealing with Rush.

60
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,030
Well, I'll admit it, I don't miss the man.

61
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,318
I say we're all better off.

62
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,279
Well, that's reassuring.

63
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,635
So if you don't measure up,
you just get left for dead?

64
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,717
What exactly is the criteria, then,
for sticking around? Do you agree?

65
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,792
All right. Let's do this.

66
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,554
All good?

67
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,949
All good.

68
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,949
Hey, Eli. Hey, when you get a chance,
can you check the shower system?

69
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,713
- The pressure's been kind of low.
- Sure, once I'm done here.

70
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,718
Dr. Caine's pretty cute, huh?
There is nothing sexier than a widower.

71
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,791
A man who's proven
that he can make a commitment

72
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,110
and is single through no fault of his own.

73
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,759
I mean, what more could you ask for?

74
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,955
I can hear you.

75
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,920
I'm so sorry!

76
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,472
DR. CAINE: How about we just carry on
like nothing happened?

77
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,309
Okay. Thank you.

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,797
God, kill me now.

79
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,630
All right, I think we're ready.

80
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,273
Welcome aboard Destiny.
I'm Lieutenant Matthew Scott.

81
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,910
- You okay?
- Excuse me?

82
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,591
Hi. Who are you?

83
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,354
Sergeant, what happened?

84
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,791
I have absolutely no idea, sir.

85
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,629
- Now, what do you think?
- I'm an IT tech.

86
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,156
You know, I fix Earth computers,
not Ancient communication devices.

87
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,038
- Malfunction in the connection?
- That's quite a hiccup.

88
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,475
I've seen worse.

89
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,473
We don't exactly know
what these stones do, do we?

90
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,075
Well, no, not personally.
I just got put on stone duty

91
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,276
'cause Riley's not back on his feet yet.

92
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,795
You know, sir, you have been
under quite a bit of stress.

93
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,189
You're not suggesting that I imagined it?

94
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,949
No.

95
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,398
Whoever took over your body was
acting kind of strangely...

96
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,792
Look, there is no way that I hallucinated
that ship or that alien.

97
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,598
My imagination isn't that good.

98
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,156
I was on a ship, and I saw an alien.

99
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,753
Now, I want to know
exactly what happened,

100
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,796
what went wrong and why.

101
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,874
And until then, the Communications Room
and that device are off-limits, understood?

102
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,473
- WRAY: Got a minute?
- Please, sit.

103
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,716
You know, I always figured
limited resources meant that

104
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,271
every day would be a struggle for survival,
but I never thought it would come to this.

105
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,318
- Is that supposed to be some sort of hint?
- Yeah, it's a hint.

106
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,595
If you're wondering what to get me
for Christmas, I need socks.

107
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,911
I heard about today's incident.

108
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,159
Caine's looking into it.

109
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,992
You know, I find it interesting that
the device just happens to malfunction

110
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,196
moments after we had
our conversation this morning.

111
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,918
I guess it's kind of coincidental.

112
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,639
That's one word. Another is "convenient."

113
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,751
And another is "surprising."

114
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,718
Okay, your turn.

115
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,075
You actually think that this will keep me
from filing my report back to Earth?

116
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,276
Actually, yeah. No, I'm pretty sure it will.

117
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,918
When the time comes, let's hope that
those who sit in judgment of you

118
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,876
grant the mercy you denied Dr. Rush.

119
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,476
I believe you mean
"allegedly" denied Dr. Rush.

120
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,994
Communications with Earth will resume
as soon as I am completely satisfied

121
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,755
that the next attempt to connect
will not result in another coincidence,

122
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,274
or convenience, or a surprise.

123
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,189
Thank you.

124
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,798
We have tomatoes!
We finally have tomatoes!

125
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,114
More or less.

126
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,754
Wow, that's odd.

127
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,995
So I was talking to Dr. Inman,
and she said the hydroponics team

128
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,116
will have strawberries for us
in about a month.

129
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,192
Sort of strawberries. Talk to me when
they can finally start growing meat.

130
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,358
Well, actually, I heard
they're working on a soy-based protein.

131
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,879
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.

132
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,632
Enjoy your Tofurky.

133
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,158
You're in a bad mood. What's the matter?

134
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,755
I haven't slept much.

135
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,319
Colonel Young has me working
round the clock

136
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,755
trying to figure out everything
that Rush was working on...

137
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,558
RICHMOND: You can't be serious.

138
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,594
Colonel Young was willing
to sacrifice his own life

139
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,636
so that one of us could have a shot
at getting on a shuttle

140
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,836
when the ship
was heading towards that star.

141
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,792
You think he's a cold-blooded murderer?

142
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,917
- I wasn't saying that.
- It's fine.

143
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,954
Can you believe it? Tomatoes!

144
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,829
Mmm!

145
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,549
What?

146
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,313
From the second we got on this ship,
they've been the ones calling all the shots.

147
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,198
What we eat, where we sleep,
what we do and when,

148
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,875
- and we just sit back and let them.
- Yeah, they're the ones with the guns.

149
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,195
Yeah, I mean,
we have every right to be afraid.

150
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,150
Look at what happened
to the last person to challenge them.

151
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,513
So, what do you think we should do?

152
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,195
I don't know.

153
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,119
Purple plants? Are you kidding me?

154
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,118
Well, purple chlorophyll is sensitive
to red and infrared light.

155
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,637
The planet's probably orbiting a red dwarf.

156
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,593
Well, the Kino says
breathable atmosphere, water and oxygen.

157
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,229
I'm concerned about potential
stellar flare activity. Spot radiation.

158
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,276
All right, then. We'll suit up.

159
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,949
Sirs! You've got to see this.

160
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,509
It just showed up.

161
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,759
- Eli.
- Bringing it up.

162
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,829
Now.

163
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,716
- What is it doing?
- Nothing yet. It's just sitting there.

164
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,472
Maybe we should try
communicating with it?

165
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,275
- How?
- Well, we have broadcast capability.

166
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,636
Of course, there's no way in hell
they'd understand us.

167
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,954
Eli.

168
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,271
But I guess
there's only one way to find out.

169
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,635
Two alien encounters in a day.
What are the chances?

170
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,753
I am thinking, likely zero.

171
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,115
Okay, sending now.

172
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,999
Let's hope they speak Ancient.

173
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,078
There is no way this is a coincidence.
I bet you I was on that ship this morning.

174
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,794
You figure you piqued their curiosity,
they came here to check on us?

175
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,348
I'm thinking they've been checking on us
for a while.

176
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,953
There's no other way
they can find us this fast.

177
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,118
They answered back.

178
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,955
That's not a translation.

179
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,350
- They answered in English.
- Now, how the hell is that possible?

180
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,793
- I...
- What did you say?

181
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,478
"Hello. We're peaceful humans
from planet Earth.

182
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,073
"We mean you no harm
and we'd like to meet you."

183
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,151
- What do I do? What do I say back?
- Nothing.

184
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,470
- Nothing?
- Nothing. Get our weapons online.

185
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,629
This is Colonel Young.
All personnel, report to designated areas.

186
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,557
Lieutenant, I need you and Greer
in that shuttle.

187
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,795
Yes, sir.

188
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,509
Something's happening.

189
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,672
I think they're launching smaller ships.

190
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,549
Oh, my God.

191
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,112
Only 30% of the weapons
are coming online.

192
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,270
Rush put limits on how many
could be activated at once.

193
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,759
Right, right, after what happened to Riley.

194
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,274
We were still in the process of checking
each gun's functionality.

195
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,033
Well, find a way around it, Eli.

196
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,429
Disengaging.

197
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,079
- YOUNG: Eli, come on.
- Hey, hey, first real space battle over here.

198
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,758
- You got it?
- GREER: Just about.

199
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,319
- Eli, activate the forward battery.
- That's what I'm trying to do.

200
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,152
- Come on, get back. Come on.
- MAN: Let's go.

201
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,315
We're taking heavy fire!

202
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,556
- Can you boost power to the shields?
- I'm working on it.

203
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,756
Shield power is being drained
by the weapons.

204
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,038
MAN: Come on, move. Go.
WOMAN: Go.

205
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,269
Stay back!

206
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,268
We've got surges happening
all over the ship.

207
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,998
The weapons system wasn't ready for this.

208
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,514
Eli, everyone on board this ship
is counting on you.

209
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,033
I don't need to hear that.

210
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,795
- You can do this.
- No. No, I can't!

211
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,189
- Yes, you can.
- Why is this all on me, okay?

212
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,236
- What about him?
- I don't care. Both of you!

213
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,709
I need this ship working now!

214
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,836
You should've thought of that
before you got rid of Rush.

215
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,229
Just fix it.

216
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,753
- You guys okay?
- MAN: Yeah.

217
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,512
- Check her!
- JAMES: Okay.

218
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,953
They're pulling back.

219
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,634
Colonel Young, this is Airman Dunning, sir.
Please respond.

220
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,755
- They're retreating.
- GREER: We got them on the run.

221
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,432
Let's give them something
to remember us by.

222
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,115
Lieutenant, I need you to end pursuit
and fall back to Destiny.

223
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,636
- But, sir...
- Do not engage. I repeat, do not engage.

224
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,517
Chloe may be on board one of those ships.

225
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,600
- SCOTT: What the hell happened?
- Easy, Lieutenant. It was nobody's fault.

226
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,830
- We were not ready for this.
- They gave up pretty quickly.

227
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,435
The attack may have been a distraction
to try to come in close and take prisoners,

228
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,351
- try to gain intel.
- Why are we the enemy?

229
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,509
I don't know.

230
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,348
Sir, that ship is still within shuttle range.
Request permission to...

231
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,634
- Permission denied.
- Colonel.

232
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,472
You wouldn't stand a chance. With me.

233
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,551
- What are we going to do?
- I'm going after her.

234
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,278
- How?
- The communication device.

235
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,351
Sir, you are only assuming
that's the same ship that you were on.

236
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,998
Guess I'll find out when I'm on board.

237
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,469
Let's elevate this.

238
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,676
Have a seat over there,
and I'll get to you as soon as I can, okay?

239
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,279
Thanks so much.

240
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,835
- Anything I can do?
- Take your pick.

241
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,040
Grab some gauze.
Don't touch, don't touch.

242
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,873
- Chloe was taken.
- What? How?

243
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,069
One of the ships latched on, cut a hole.

244
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,993
I can't get a pulse over here!

245
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,117
Grab the bag.
Keep the pressure on him, please.

246
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,915
- Caine.
- Yeah?

247
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,638
- Caine, we need you.
- Okay.

248
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,115
Okay, that's good.

249
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,755
Tighter.

250
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,278
Sir. Sir! Let me do it.

251
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,952
Lieutenant, it's not going to happen.

252
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,589
For the record,
I think this is a very bad idea.

253
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,553
Yes, but it's the best of the bad ideas.

254
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,954
Go.

255
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,351
ELI: I think I got most of the weapons
back online.

256
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,990
- How long is he going in for?
- Twenty minutes, then we pull him out.

257
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,149
Okay.

258
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,750
Colonel, you can always go back in
if you don't find her.

259
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,149
Okay?

260
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,950
We are not your enemy.

261
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,837
We mean you no harm.

262
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,272
I don't think it understands you.

263
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,117
They spoke English.

264
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,872
They sent a one-word message.

265
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,958
For all we know, they have a translation
device on their ship or something.

266
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,632
SCOTT: Which sent it in Ancient.

267
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,394
Why did you attack us?

268
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,676
Why did you take
one of our people prisoner?

269
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,149
Why did you do that?

270
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,469
You want to help me?

271
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,714
This is how you read my mind.

272
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,959
Do you understand?

273
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,079
This one transmits.

274
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,239
This one receives.

275
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,874
Like this. Here, like this.

276
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,877
Yeah. Yeah.

277
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,155
Do not engage.
Chloe may be aboard one of those ships.

278
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,355
Colonel Young!

279
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,911
- What happened?
- He's back.

280
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,632
- YOUNG: What just happened?
- The alien ship is closing in on us.

281
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,475
Send me back.

282
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,993
Send me back now!

283
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,318
Okay, good to go.

284
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,595
Ready.

285
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,479
It's not working. Why isn't it working?

286
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,475
Untie me.

287
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,075
There doesn't seem to be anything
wrong with the device.

288
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,832
Did you find Chloe?

289
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,355
Guys? You may have noticed
they're attacking us again.

290
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,834
Eli.

291
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,350
Our shields aren't going to hold
for much longer.

292
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,078
Bring the main weapon online.
Fire on the big ship.

293
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,112
Chloe is still on board that ship!

294
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,313
Do it now, Eli! Return fire!
Everything we've got!

295
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,954
We can't keep this up.
The whole weapons system is overloading.

296
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,310
- Shields are down almost 50%.
- I know!

297
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,351
- Where are you going?
- To try and save Chloe.

298
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,000
RUSH: It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

299
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,756
We have to go. Here.

300
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,351
Oh, God.
Where are we going?

301
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,034
This way.

302
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,030
- Report.
- Bad and more bad.

303
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,588
Too much power is going to the weapons.
Our shields are going to fail.

304
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,873
Bolster the shield. Devote all remaining
weapons power to the main weapon.

305
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,752
Keep firing on the big ship.

306
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,395
Not like you,
taking the shuttle without asking.

307
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,031
He'll say no, and I don't want to disobey
an order. You got a problem with that?

308
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,429
You want to save her? Do it.

309
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,513
- I'm going. You don't have to.
- I'm already here.

310
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,035
- They're retreating.
- Keep firing.

311
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,839
We fire again,
and we risk blowing ourselves up.

312
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,916
I don't have a choice. Do it.

313
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,795
They're retreating.

314
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,916
All of them except that one.

315
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,275
Wait.

316
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,115
They're gone.

317
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,395
Matt!

318
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,999
Colonel Young said you were dead.

319
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,913
Did he? Did he say how it happened?

320
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,392
- Rock slide.
- Well, obviously, he was wrong again.

321
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,515
Colonel Young, this is Greer. Come in.

322
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,635
Go ahead.

323
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,516
GREER: You are not going to believe this.

324
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:34,757
I managed to activate the systems
on the crashed ship.

325
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,149
Found a database.

326
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,711
I'd only just begun to look through it
when aliens showed up.

327
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,592
I guess I must have accidentally activated
some kind of distress beacon.

328
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,188
Anyway, I'm glad I did.
I would have died out there.

329
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,910
Well, there are a few people
who thought Colonel Young

330
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,353
left you to die on purpose.

331
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,269
RUSH: I imagine there were.

332
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,995
No, no, he would have rightly assumed
that I was... I was gone.

333
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,953
In the rock slide.

334
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:07,030
So, what happened when the aliens
brought you on their ship?

335
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,395
To be honest, I don't remember that much.

336
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,989
The few times I was conscious,
they were probing my mind.

337
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,996
That's something
I'd rather not think about, really.

338
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,118
I know they were frustrated.

339
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,233
I seemed to be able to resist
giving them the information they wanted.

340
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,189
He used their own neural interface
against them,

341
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,231
getting what he needed
so we could escape.

342
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,512
Location of the fighter bay,
basic operating systems.

343
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:41,719
Anything else?
Like why they wanted to destroy us?

344
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:46,630
I don't think they did want to destroy us.
What they really want is Destiny.

345
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,959
Probably only care about us
because we recently came aboard.

346
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:58,271
No, what they want
is a way past her defenses,

347
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,117
try and find out
what secrets she might hold.

348
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,879
Unfortunately, I didn't have time
to find out any more.

349
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:16,031
My first priority was getting
Chloe and I off the ship.

350
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,434
Well, it's good to have you back.

351
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,315
Both of you.

352
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,110
- So?
- So.

353
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,190
I suppose you're wondering

354
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,392
why I didn't tell everyone the truth.

355
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,879
YOUNG: It's your word against mine.

356
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,993
I didn't tell anyone you tried to frame me
for Spencer's death.

357
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,395
Well, that's true.

358
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,471
No, I just wanted to know
whether I can assume that

359
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,915
you are going to try and kill me again
next chance you get.

360
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,872
I saved you from those aliens.

361
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,794
You fired on the alien ship
while I was still aboard.

362
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,233
Well, so was Chloe.

363
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,869
That was a command decision,
protecting the greater good.

364
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,669
Yes, indeed.

365
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:41,833
Look, I realize that I did provoke you.

366
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,673
Well, if it means anything,
I regret leaving you on that planet.

367
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,512
Don't get me wrong,
I think you deserved it,

368
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,716
but I regret that I lost control,

369
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,712
that I became a man
that I couldn't respect anymore.

370
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,159
Well, you're here, I'm here.
We just have to live with it, don't we?

371
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,071
Well, so does everyone else on board.

372
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,152
They don't need the distraction.

373
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,833
They don't need to doubt their leadership,

374
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,876
and this ship needs to be ready
for the next encounter.

375
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,638
If we haven't found our way home by then.

376
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,598
Of course.

377
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,193
So, what,
we just pretend nothing happened?

378
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,157
Well, it's not like we were ever friends.

379
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:41,075
- For the sake of the crew.
- For the sake of the crew.

380
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,199
- Hey, there.
- Hi!

381
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,317
- Do you mind?
- No, it's okay.

382
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,510
- You want to try some?
- What is it?

383
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,149
It's a little something
that Dr. Inman's been working on.

384
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:18,750
She claims it tastes like gin.
I say it's a little closer to rubbing alcohol.

385
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,269
Solid sales pitch. No, thank you.

386
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,919
All right.

387
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:30,793
So, what do you think?
You and James, any chance there?

388
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,556
It could just get really awkward,
you know, if things didn't work out.

389
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,755
I mean, being stuck on this ship

390
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,719
with someone you've had
a bad relationship with? No, thanks.

391
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,949
It's probably best
to just keep things professional,

392
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:48,277
for as long as we can, anyways.
I mean, we'll see.

393
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,836
If we're here much longer,

394
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,037
I hereby reserve the right
to completely change my mind.

395
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,028
And when the hour is upon us

396
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,918
And our beauty surely gone

397
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:19,352
No, you will not be forgotten

398
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:27,116
And you will not be alone

399
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,919
No, you will not be alone

400
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:43,636
And when the day has all but ended

401
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,072
And our echo starts to fade

402
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:01,068
No, you will not be alone then

403
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,430
And you will not be afraid

404
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,351
No, you will not be afraid

405
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,710
And when the fog has finally lifted

406
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,196
From my cold and tired brow

407
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:42,317
No, I will not leave you crying

408
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,830
No, I will not let you down

409
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,872
No, I will not let you down

410
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,511
I will not let you down

411
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,558
The Colonel's dangerous.

412
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,632
We need to do something about that.

413
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,314
I tried.

414
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,395
- I know.
- Damn near killed me for it.

415
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,114
Next time will be different.

416
