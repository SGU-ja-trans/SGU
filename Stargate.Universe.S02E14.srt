1
00:00:04,112 --> 00:00:08,606
<i>I may be on the verge of discovering
the true nature ofDestiny's mission.</i>

2
00:00:09,985 --> 00:00:12,818
<i>You've had control of this ship
the whole time!</i>

3
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:14,455
Why wouldn't you tell anyone?

4
00:00:14,524 --> 00:00:17,459
The Lucian Alliance is planning
an attack on Earth.

5
00:00:18,161 --> 00:00:21,062
<i>I killed Riley.
I suffocated him with my own hands.</i>

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,189
You are a good commander.

7
00:00:23,266 --> 00:00:26,201
<i>There is no mission other
than getting these people home.</i>

8
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:29,534
<i>It was never about going home, it's
about getting us to where we're going.</i>

9
00:00:29,605 --> 00:00:32,096
That is the mission.

10
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:36,507
And if ever you were gonna have
a chance with anyone, this is probably it.

11
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,309
I've thought a lot about you.

12
00:00:38,782 --> 00:00:39,771
We need to talk.

13
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:40,839
I'm sorry?

14
00:00:40,918 --> 00:00:42,112
- Where's Ginn?
- She's on Earth.

15
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:43,516
Ginn told Homeworld Command

16
00:00:43,587 --> 00:00:45,748
that Simeon had intelligence
about an attack

17
00:00:45,823 --> 00:00:47,381
that was being planned against Earth.

18
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:48,925
Then he killed Ginn.

19
00:00:49,326 --> 00:00:50,418
<i>Amanda Perry is dead.</i>

20
00:00:52,496 --> 00:00:53,485
There's been an attack.

21
00:00:53,597 --> 00:00:56,362
We think there might be a bomb onboard,
as yet unexploded.

22
00:00:56,434 --> 00:00:57,423
I think I can help.

23
00:00:57,502 --> 00:00:59,026
I can tell you how to defuse that bomb.

24
00:00:59,637 --> 00:01:00,695
Have you heard anything?

25
00:01:00,772 --> 00:01:01,761
Not yet.

26
00:01:05,777 --> 00:01:09,406
Day six. Shifts running continuously
around the clock,

27
00:01:10,014 --> 00:01:13,541
just like you ordered,
but still no connection.

28
00:01:16,155 --> 00:01:17,213
I'm up next.

29
00:01:20,893 --> 00:01:21,882
You okay?

30
00:01:22,428 --> 00:01:24,521
Yeah. Just... Leg fell asleep.

31
00:01:28,501 --> 00:01:29,490
Okay.

32
00:01:39,446 --> 00:01:40,811
Checkmate.

33
00:01:43,717 --> 00:01:44,706
Again.

34
00:01:45,385 --> 00:01:47,216
You might want to put
a bit of effort into it this time.

35
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:48,880
Doesn't it bother you?

36
00:01:49,923 --> 00:01:51,891
We don't know
if that bomb was defused in time.

37
00:01:53,126 --> 00:01:54,560
You're worried about your mom.

38
00:01:56,364 --> 00:01:58,264
I'm worried about everyone.

39
00:02:01,903 --> 00:02:03,871
So, again?

40
00:02:05,206 --> 00:02:07,936
Come on, take your mind off it
for half an hour or so.

41
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,604
Couple of minutes, the way you're playing.

42
00:02:12,513 --> 00:02:14,243
<i>Also Sprach Zarathustra.</i>

43
00:02:16,218 --> 00:02:18,413
<i>It's the theme from 2001:A
Space Odyssey.</i>

44
00:02:18,487 --> 00:02:21,047
- So why didn't you just say that?
- Because that's not what it's called.

45
00:02:21,123 --> 00:02:24,286
<i>It's called Also Sprach Zarathustra,
Thus Spoke Zarathustra. It's by Strauss.</i>

46
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:25,621
But nobody knows it by that name,

47
00:02:25,694 --> 00:02:26,991
so why not just say the name
people know about?

48
00:02:27,095 --> 00:02:28,585
Look, you asked me what my favorite
piece of music was,

49
00:02:28,664 --> 00:02:30,757
- and I'm telling you. That's what it is.
- Yeah, I'm just saying...

50
00:02:30,832 --> 00:02:33,062
It's the one piece that reminds me
of the very moment

51
00:02:33,135 --> 00:02:36,503
<i>- I wanted to be an astrophysicist.
- Right, when you saw 2001?</i>

52
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,729
Yes.

53
00:02:38,808 --> 00:02:40,275
That's my point.
That people know that song

54
00:02:40,343 --> 00:02:42,903
- only because of the movie.
- Song? It's not a song, Brody.

55
00:02:43,179 --> 00:02:44,237
Oh, it's not a song now?

56
00:02:47,483 --> 00:02:48,472
You all right?

57
00:02:49,185 --> 00:02:52,951
Yes. It's you.
You get me wound up with your stupid...

58
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,046
Hey, hey...

59
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:58,258
Colonel Young, this is Brody. Come in.

60
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,328
<i>Go ahead.</i>

61
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:02,896
I think we have a connection.

62
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:11,268
<i>You're aboard the Destiny.
I'm Colonel Young. Who are you?</i>

63
00:03:14,613 --> 00:03:15,807
I'm Ginn.

64
00:03:16,681 --> 00:03:18,376
What happened?

65
00:03:30,762 --> 00:03:33,458
I had some trouble
breathing, at first.

66
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:36,927
Dr. Perry's condition
was difficult to adjust to.

67
00:03:38,204 --> 00:03:40,138
- Eli.
Ginn?

68
00:03:40,606 --> 00:03:42,801
It's you? Really?

69
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:49,012
- What happened, then?
- Your people from Homeworld Security

70
00:03:49,081 --> 00:03:51,049
asked me questions
about the Lucian Alliance.

71
00:03:51,784 --> 00:03:53,878
I answered as best I could, and then...

72
00:03:55,622 --> 00:03:56,611
Nothing.

73
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,083
Nothing?

74
00:03:59,293 --> 00:04:00,351
It's strange.

75
00:04:00,661 --> 00:04:03,027
One moment I was answering questions,

76
00:04:03,096 --> 00:04:05,428
and the next thing I knew,
I was sitting here.

77
00:04:15,543 --> 00:04:16,669
What happened?

78
00:04:17,078 --> 00:04:19,308
Why didn't I return to my own body?

79
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:27,247
Ginn, while you were
connected to Dr. Perry,

80
00:04:27,322 --> 00:04:30,348
one of your people, Simeon, he killed you.

81
00:04:31,426 --> 00:04:36,091
And we received confirmation
that Dr. Perry died on Earth as well.

82
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:41,201
That can't be true.

83
00:04:46,308 --> 00:04:48,469
Then, how am I still here?

84
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,753
Heya, T.J. You burning the midnight oil?

85
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,318
<i>Well, since Rush broke
Destiny's master code,</i>

86
00:05:03,393 --> 00:05:06,157
all these Ancient medical devices
are now accessible to us,

87
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:08,697
so I'm kind of taking
a crash course on them,

88
00:05:08,765 --> 00:05:11,063
although it would help if I were fluent
in Ancient...

89
00:05:12,168 --> 00:05:13,157
You okay?

90
00:05:13,603 --> 00:05:18,598
Oh, yeah, I'm feeling a little
under the weather, trouble sleeping.

91
00:05:18,676 --> 00:05:19,973
I was wondering if you could
give me something.

92
00:05:20,344 --> 00:05:21,834
A good night's sleep would do me wonders.

93
00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:27,508
Yeah, yeah, sure, hang on.
I got just the thing. Let's see.

94
00:05:27,752 --> 00:05:29,879
Here. Just gonna take this,
mix it with water,

95
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:33,789
give it about a half hour or so
and it'll calm you down,

96
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,385
help you relax, and maybe...

97
00:05:40,532 --> 00:05:42,329
It doesn't make any sense.

98
00:05:42,401 --> 00:05:45,427
Well, obviously we don't know
as much about the stones as we thought.

99
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:50,504
Look, Ginn was... Ginn was murdered.

100
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,905
So, therefore, the connection
wasn't properly severed

101
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:56,346
with the communication device.

102
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,844
Now perhaps her consciousness
became displaced.

103
00:06:00,153 --> 00:06:01,142
Displaced?

104
00:06:01,754 --> 00:06:04,985
Floating around, like a radio signal?

105
00:06:06,292 --> 00:06:08,453
Chloe just happened to be the one
to tune into it.

106
00:06:08,928 --> 00:06:10,020
But why her?

107
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,857
We've had people on stone duty
around the clock for days now.

108
00:06:12,932 --> 00:06:14,332
Why didn't any of them connect with Ginn?

109
00:06:15,002 --> 00:06:17,493
Well, perhaps because Chloe
was the only one to fall asleep.

110
00:06:19,173 --> 00:06:21,573
Her consciousness relaxed just enough

111
00:06:21,642 --> 00:06:23,200
to allow an opening for a connection.

112
00:06:23,977 --> 00:06:26,639
Well, I don't know, Colonel.
It's just conjecture at this point.

113
00:06:27,448 --> 00:06:29,882
I'm sorry, but the bigger question here is,

114
00:06:30,317 --> 00:06:34,254
if Ginn is in Chloe's body,
whose body is Chloe connected to?

115
00:06:38,793 --> 00:06:41,023
How long have you been feeling like this?

116
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:42,518
A few days now.

117
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:43,719
"Few" meaning...

118
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:45,964
A week, maybe two.

119
00:06:47,902 --> 00:06:48,891
Maybe a month.

120
00:06:55,444 --> 00:06:59,380
Your blood pressure's high. 176 over 110.

121
00:06:59,882 --> 00:07:02,874
I used to take blood pressure pills.
Hypertension.

122
00:07:03,185 --> 00:07:05,085
<i>I ran out shortly after
we got to Destiny.</i>

123
00:07:05,454 --> 00:07:06,853
Why didn't you tell me?

124
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:08,483
Well, there's nothing
you could do about it.

125
00:07:08,557 --> 00:07:10,047
It's not like you could
write me another prescription.

126
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,786
No, I have medicinals that could help.

127
00:07:11,861 --> 00:07:14,228
Tea leaves have been effective
in improving circulation...

128
00:07:14,297 --> 00:07:16,629
T.J., I was feeling fine.
I didn't think it was a problem.

129
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:19,133
Hypertension is often symptomless
but dangerous.

130
00:07:19,202 --> 00:07:20,430
Didn't your doctor tell you this?

131
00:07:22,372 --> 00:07:25,170
Okay. Look, one of these Ancient machines

132
00:07:25,242 --> 00:07:27,176
is used for diagnostics,
including blood work,

133
00:07:27,244 --> 00:07:28,268
so I'm going to run a few tests.

134
00:07:28,345 --> 00:07:30,506
I just think a good night's sleep
is all I'm going to need.

135
00:07:30,814 --> 00:07:32,975
Probably. Let's just be sure, okay?

136
00:07:46,564 --> 00:07:47,553
Nothing.

137
00:07:48,466 --> 00:07:51,924
So, whoever Chloe is connected to,
they're definitely not on Earth.

138
00:07:55,774 --> 00:07:57,241
Wow, look at that face.

139
00:07:57,976 --> 00:07:59,807
That can only mean good news, right?

140
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,204
May I come in?

141
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,640
Yeah.

142
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:17,524
Your kidneys are failing.

143
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,190
End-stage renal disease.

144
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:23,402
All of them?

145
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:27,934
Kidney disease tends to attack
both kidneys at the same time.

146
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,402
Okay.

147
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,812
Okay, can we do anything?
Any of your medicinals...

148
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:39,841
No.

149
00:08:40,421 --> 00:08:44,721
The problem with kidney disease is,
by the time you have symptoms,

150
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:46,783
it's already too far advanced.

151
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:50,622
On Earth, the next step would be dialysis.

152
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:52,590
Um...

153
00:08:53,535 --> 00:08:56,265
The machines in the infirmary,
do any of them...

154
00:08:57,272 --> 00:09:01,572
No. I already checked.
It's mostly testing equipment,

155
00:09:01,776 --> 00:09:06,236
some devices for use during surgery,
but nothing for dialysis.

156
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:14,146
The only other option for treatment
would be a transplant.

157
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:17,948
Rush killed him?

158
00:09:18,027 --> 00:09:22,088
Chased him halfway across a desert planet.
I wanted to go, too, but...

159
00:09:22,264 --> 00:09:25,097
No, I'm glad you didn't.
I'd hate to see you get hurt.

160
00:09:25,301 --> 00:09:27,826
Hey, I wasn't going to get hurt.

161
00:09:28,804 --> 00:09:30,465
I was just so...

162
00:09:31,641 --> 00:09:35,339
I had to do something.
You know, after what he did, I wasn't...

163
00:09:41,351 --> 00:09:45,082
Whoa, no... It's just...

164
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:49,649
I'm sorry. I...

165
00:09:50,293 --> 00:09:53,229
No. No, no, no, no, no, no. It's okay.

166
00:09:54,432 --> 00:10:01,031
Believe me, there's nothing more
I want to do right now than kiss you.

167
00:10:01,606 --> 00:10:02,834
What's going to happen to me?

168
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:06,704
Is there any way that I
can get back into my own body?

169
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,113
After you...

170
00:10:18,824 --> 00:10:21,156
The next planet we stopped at,

171
00:10:23,996 --> 00:10:25,156
it was beautiful.

172
00:10:28,434 --> 00:10:30,026
We buried your body there.

173
00:10:31,437 --> 00:10:34,896
Had a memorial service. It was...

174
00:10:36,643 --> 00:10:39,237
Then, where will I return to?

175
00:10:40,213 --> 00:10:41,407
I don't know.

176
00:10:42,082 --> 00:10:45,381
I mean, we don't even know who
Chloe is connected to on the other end,

177
00:10:45,585 --> 00:10:47,212
if she's safe.

178
00:10:47,887 --> 00:10:51,323
I've been trying to remember more,
but I just can't...

179
00:10:53,561 --> 00:10:54,823
What? What's wrong?

180
00:10:54,895 --> 00:10:56,453
Ginn? Ginn!

181
00:10:59,467 --> 00:11:02,163
Help! Somebody help!

182
00:11:03,637 --> 00:11:04,899
Hey, hey...

183
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:10,999
You all right?

184
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,110
What just happened?

185
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:19,542
I don't know.

186
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,688
I'll be right back.

187
00:11:29,464 --> 00:11:32,297
As far as I can tell,
there's nothing physically wrong with her.

188
00:11:32,434 --> 00:11:33,925
So, do you have any idea what caused it?

189
00:11:34,137 --> 00:11:35,263
I have no idea.

190
00:11:35,338 --> 00:11:39,104
It was weird. We were just talking
and then suddenly, she was choking.

191
00:11:39,175 --> 00:11:40,301
No reason.

192
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:43,745
Ginn was strangled by Simeon.

193
00:11:44,747 --> 00:11:47,511
Now, brain function is really just
a series of electrical signals.

194
00:11:47,984 --> 00:11:50,817
Energy which is no doubt the foundation
of how the stones work.

195
00:11:52,021 --> 00:11:54,786
Now, she was murdered
before she was disconnected.

196
00:11:55,092 --> 00:11:59,961
So, what, the energy was disrupted,
resulting in some kind of glitch

197
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,429
that made her replay the event?

198
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:04,067
Do you think
we should disconnect the stone?

199
00:12:04,134 --> 00:12:06,034
If we disconnect,
who knows what'll happen to Ginn?

200
00:12:06,136 --> 00:12:07,933
We may not be able to get her back.

201
00:12:08,005 --> 00:12:10,200
Eli, if she has another attack,
Chloe could be harmed.

202
00:12:10,274 --> 00:12:12,868
But T.J. just said there's nothing
physically wrong with her.

203
00:12:12,943 --> 00:12:14,343
I just think that we should study this,

204
00:12:14,612 --> 00:12:18,673
see if there's some way that we can
save Ginn without harming either of them.

205
00:12:18,983 --> 00:12:20,109
I agree.

206
00:12:20,885 --> 00:12:22,318
It warrants further study.

207
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,114
All right, well, let's go ahead.
We'll keep an eye on her.

208
00:12:25,256 --> 00:12:26,917
Hopefully, this is a one-time event.

209
00:12:27,725 --> 00:12:30,159
Sir, there's something else
I need to talk to you about.

210
00:12:32,831 --> 00:12:35,164
Transplant? How soon?

211
00:12:36,268 --> 00:12:37,257
As soon as possible.

212
00:12:37,369 --> 00:12:38,461
Well, we can't connect to Earth,

213
00:12:38,537 --> 00:12:41,802
so using the stones to bring a doctor
onboard is out of the question.

214
00:12:41,874 --> 00:12:42,863
Yes, sir.

215
00:12:42,942 --> 00:12:47,038
Given the obvious limitations of this ship,
is that type of surgery even possible here?

216
00:12:47,446 --> 00:12:49,277
We have access to more Ancient devices

217
00:12:49,348 --> 00:12:52,806
as well as a pretty extensive medical
database since Rush cracked the code.

218
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:54,646
Anything in there
about organ transplants?

219
00:12:54,754 --> 00:12:56,381
Probably, I don't know.

220
00:12:56,456 --> 00:12:58,151
I've just begun to search through it all.

221
00:12:58,358 --> 00:13:01,088
All right, well, sounds like
you've got to get back at it.

222
00:13:01,294 --> 00:13:03,592
Sir, listen, in order to do this procedure,

223
00:13:04,364 --> 00:13:06,229
we're going to need a compatible donor.

224
00:13:06,566 --> 00:13:08,261
Well, you have the records
of everybody's blood type.

225
00:13:08,401 --> 00:13:11,336
We're also going to need to tissue-type
to get a thorough match.

226
00:13:11,938 --> 00:13:14,032
- Okay.
- It's going to be extremely difficult.

227
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:16,109
There's not that many people
on board this ship.

228
00:13:16,677 --> 00:13:19,043
To get an adequate match,
it's a long shot at best.

229
00:13:19,113 --> 00:13:22,048
T.J., let's just... First things first.
Start testing.

230
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:23,912
Let's see if this is even possible.

231
00:13:25,353 --> 00:13:26,615
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

232
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:31,780
T. J?

233
00:13:32,526 --> 00:13:34,927
Oh, hey, thanks for coming.

234
00:13:35,097 --> 00:13:36,689
I cross-checked blood types.

235
00:13:36,798 --> 00:13:39,824
There's 18 people on board the ship
who are compatible with Dr. Volker.

236
00:13:40,636 --> 00:13:42,536
Among them are you two.

237
00:13:43,071 --> 00:13:45,539
It's not too complicated. I just need to
draw some blood if that's okay.

238
00:13:45,774 --> 00:13:46,763
Let's do it.

239
00:13:47,142 --> 00:13:48,131
You first?

240
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:51,537
I'm a Marine. We're always first.

241
00:13:54,517 --> 00:13:57,884
So, what are the chances
of getting a good match here?

242
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,054
Well, it's a matter of degrees.

243
00:14:00,156 --> 00:14:03,819
We're looking for certain genetic markers
on white blood cells.

244
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,689
No one on board the ship is related to him,

245
00:14:05,795 --> 00:14:07,592
so that rules out the best possible match,

246
00:14:07,697 --> 00:14:12,293
but hopefully we can find one close enough
that warrants doing the transplant.

247
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,398
T.J., you're gonna be okay.
You can do this.

248
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:23,440
Yeah, piece of cake.

249
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:26,405
How's it going?

250
00:14:26,517 --> 00:14:30,544
Well, Rush has some ideas,
but we're still working on it.

251
00:14:31,488 --> 00:14:32,477
How are you doing?

252
00:14:33,692 --> 00:14:35,717
I feel different.

253
00:14:36,995 --> 00:14:40,021
It's not like the last time
I used the communication stones.

254
00:14:40,432 --> 00:14:43,924
Well, what's different?
I mean, aside from the choking part.

255
00:14:46,237 --> 00:14:49,263
Something just doesn't feel right.

256
00:14:56,515 --> 00:15:00,042
We're gonna figure out
what's going on here. I promise.

257
00:15:02,288 --> 00:15:04,483
I'm not gonna lose you again.

258
00:15:19,172 --> 00:15:22,630
- I heard about Dr. Volker.
- Yeah, tough break.

259
00:15:23,577 --> 00:15:26,944
You know,
this surgery is fraught with danger,

260
00:15:28,348 --> 00:15:30,578
- even in the best of circumstances...
- Are you compatible?

261
00:15:32,987 --> 00:15:35,217
- Sorry?
- Your blood type. Are you compatible?

262
00:15:36,557 --> 00:15:37,546
No.

263
00:15:38,059 --> 00:15:39,822
I'm just checking. Go on.

264
00:15:41,562 --> 00:15:43,757
Look, I don't want to lose
anyone on this ship, Colonel,

265
00:15:43,831 --> 00:15:46,925
but the fact is, a transplant risks
not just one life, but two.

266
00:15:47,001 --> 00:15:48,628
I'm not just gonna sit back
and let the man die

267
00:15:48,703 --> 00:15:50,500
without at least trying
to figure out something.

268
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:52,334
<i>T.J., we need you
in Ginn's quarters, now!</i>

269
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:55,438
<i>I'm on my way.
- Hurry!</i>

270
00:15:55,911 --> 00:15:59,176
Eli, what's happening to me?

271
00:15:59,615 --> 00:16:00,604
Ginn...

272
00:16:00,682 --> 00:16:03,116
No. Help me.

273
00:16:04,086 --> 00:16:05,246
Chloe?

274
00:16:14,597 --> 00:16:17,691
Chloe?
- No, Ginn.

275
00:16:18,701 --> 00:16:22,432
- What happened?
- You had another choking attack.

276
00:16:22,872 --> 00:16:24,464
You switched with Chloe
for a minute there.

277
00:16:26,776 --> 00:16:29,540
Look, when you switched with her,
where did you go?

278
00:16:30,346 --> 00:16:33,009
- Was there anyone else there with you?
No.

279
00:16:33,384 --> 00:16:37,548
I don't...
I remember not being able to breathe,

280
00:16:38,322 --> 00:16:41,553
and then I woke up here just now.

281
00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:43,490
- Colonel?
- Yeah.

282
00:16:43,594 --> 00:16:48,691
I checked with Corporal Barnes.
The connection wasn't cut at any time.

283
00:16:48,866 --> 00:16:49,855
Really?

284
00:16:49,934 --> 00:16:52,095
Then how was Chloe
able to switch back with her?

285
00:16:53,605 --> 00:16:57,200
See, I don't believe that Chloe
is connected with anyone at the other end.

286
00:16:57,709 --> 00:17:01,406
I believe her consciousness
has been in her own body the entire time.

287
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,674
Suppressed by Ginn's?

288
00:17:02,747 --> 00:17:03,736
How is that possible?

289
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:06,113
I don't know. I'll have to further study
the communication device.

290
00:17:06,218 --> 00:17:07,515
- We should pull the stone.
No, no, no.

291
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:09,779
We have to find out why
this is happening first.

292
00:17:09,888 --> 00:17:12,517
- Not at the risk of Chloe's life, Rush...
- This is crucial for understanding

293
00:17:12,592 --> 00:17:14,423
- how these communication stones work.
- Figure it out, okay?

294
00:17:14,527 --> 00:17:17,018
Because the next time she has an attack,
I'm going to pull the stone.

295
00:17:17,096 --> 00:17:18,825
- No, no, you can't...
- No hesitation.

296
00:17:27,306 --> 00:17:30,207
- I don't want to hurt Chloe.
- Yeah, I know. I know you don't.

297
00:17:30,476 --> 00:17:34,106
I agree with Colonel Young.
If I start choking again, disconnect me.

298
00:17:34,181 --> 00:17:35,978
Hopefully we find a solution before then.

299
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:37,744
Solution?
- To the situation.

300
00:17:40,087 --> 00:17:41,679
- Chloe?
- What's going on here?

301
00:17:41,755 --> 00:17:42,744
Is it you?

302
00:17:42,856 --> 00:17:44,949
Yes. Matt, what happened?

303
00:17:45,225 --> 00:17:48,285
Ginn connected with you when you used
the communication stones.

304
00:17:48,395 --> 00:17:50,420
Ginn? Well, I thought...

305
00:17:51,832 --> 00:17:52,959
I thought she was dead.

306
00:17:53,168 --> 00:17:55,227
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

307
00:17:57,138 --> 00:17:59,333
Corporal Barnes,
did you just disconnect the stones?

308
00:17:59,407 --> 00:18:00,704
<i>No, sir. Still active.</i>

309
00:18:01,242 --> 00:18:03,073
What do you mean?
She's still connected to me?

310
00:18:03,211 --> 00:18:04,678
Do you feel any different?

311
00:18:05,113 --> 00:18:08,480
Can you sense someone else,
you know, inside your brain?

312
00:18:08,683 --> 00:18:09,672
What?

313
00:18:10,451 --> 00:18:11,816
- Ginn?
- Yes.

314
00:18:11,886 --> 00:18:13,514
Oh, man, this is nuts.

315
00:18:13,756 --> 00:18:14,814
What happened?

316
00:18:15,024 --> 00:18:16,855
You switched with Chloe
for a moment there.

317
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,256
Wait a minute,
you don't remember it?

318
00:18:18,827 --> 00:18:21,523
No. It's all so strange.

319
00:18:22,431 --> 00:18:23,921
I feel weaker.

320
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:25,430
Here, sit down.

321
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,203
I'm sorry, can you just
excuse us a second here?

322
00:18:34,978 --> 00:18:35,967
Okay? Eli?

323
00:18:39,182 --> 00:18:40,809
Hey. What?

324
00:18:41,384 --> 00:18:44,649
I don't know.
I mean, we can't be sure of anything until...

325
00:18:44,721 --> 00:18:45,949
Eli...

326
00:18:47,324 --> 00:18:49,189
Her energy might be decaying.

327
00:18:50,727 --> 00:18:53,993
The radio signal getting weaker,
harder to keep tuned in.

328
00:18:54,832 --> 00:18:58,393
Matt, even without disconnecting
the communication stone,

329
00:18:58,469 --> 00:19:02,633
we might not have much time before
we lose Ginn completely.

330
00:19:09,947 --> 00:19:12,142
How's that translation program
working for you?

331
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:17,052
Good. A lot of information here.
Some good stuff about organ transplants.

332
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:18,954
Hey, you see this?

333
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:23,123
According to the database,
it's a kind of a ligature device.

334
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,224
Cuts and cauterizes at the same time?

335
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,864
I thought it did something like that,
but I could never get it to work.

336
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:30,901
Hey, T.J., there's a whole section here
on stem cell-like procedure

337
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,404
for post-op anti-rejection.

338
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,197
It's only 176 pages.

339
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,308
A little light afternoon reading.

340
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,743
Still a lot of other
potential post-operative drawbacks.

341
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:45,179
Infection, high blood pressure,
erectile dysfunction...

342
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,793
Why is that funny?

343
00:20:05,906 --> 00:20:07,464
After everything that's happened recently,

344
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,032
we can't be sure this thing's
even working properly anymore.

345
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,475
What is it you're trying to do?

346
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:13,844
We're trying to see if there's a way
we can intercept Ginn's signal

347
00:20:13,915 --> 00:20:15,542
and download it
into the ship's memory banks.

348
00:20:15,784 --> 00:20:17,251
Okay, then what?

349
00:20:17,385 --> 00:20:19,876
What is she? She's just another
program in the ship's computer?

350
00:20:20,388 --> 00:20:22,788
Well, she'd be preserved,
for the time being,

351
00:20:23,491 --> 00:20:26,654
until we can determine the viability
of downloading her consciousness

352
00:20:27,162 --> 00:20:28,390
into another body.

353
00:20:29,331 --> 00:20:30,559
<i>Colonel?</i>

354
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,690
T. J?

355
00:20:33,402 --> 00:20:36,462
<i>We have a match.
Two, actually.</i>

356
00:20:37,773 --> 00:20:40,833
Tissue-typing takes a look
at six specific antigens

357
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:43,037
in the blood of the
recipient and the donor.

358
00:20:43,112 --> 00:20:46,206
The best compatibility, obviously,
is a six-antigen match.

359
00:20:46,282 --> 00:20:47,943
It happens most often in families.

360
00:20:48,751 --> 00:20:52,984
The two of you, you both have
a four-antigen match with Dr. Volker,

361
00:20:53,323 --> 00:20:55,757
which is surprisingly good, considering.

362
00:20:55,826 --> 00:20:57,794
The equipment that you used,
how accurate is it?

363
00:20:57,894 --> 00:20:59,589
- Because I want to make sure...
- I'll do it.

364
00:21:00,964 --> 00:21:02,898
Sergeant, listen to me.

365
00:21:02,966 --> 00:21:05,332
There are a lot of risks involved
in this procedure,

366
00:21:05,402 --> 00:21:07,267
and you don't have to decide
right this instant.

367
00:21:07,671 --> 00:21:09,536
- Think it over.
No need, sir.

368
00:21:10,941 --> 00:21:13,035
I'm good to go, Lieutenant.

369
00:21:16,481 --> 00:21:18,176
The Ancients wrote about a procedure

370
00:21:18,249 --> 00:21:21,650
to eliminate post-operative rejection
of transplanted organs.

371
00:21:22,754 --> 00:21:27,782
It involves removing bone marrow
stem cells from the donor prior to surgery,

372
00:21:27,892 --> 00:21:31,589
and then implanting them into the recipient
at the time of the transplant.

373
00:21:32,331 --> 00:21:35,892
It produces a state called mixed chimerism,
which is basically an immune system

374
00:21:35,968 --> 00:21:38,698
that blends elements of both
the recipient and the donor.

375
00:21:38,837 --> 00:21:41,397
You need some bone marrow.
So, go ahead and take it.

376
00:21:42,908 --> 00:21:44,068
Okay.

377
00:21:44,209 --> 00:21:46,769
I can give you something
to put you to sleep during the procedure.

378
00:21:46,845 --> 00:21:47,834
Don't worry about it.

379
00:21:47,946 --> 00:21:49,743
We're short on meds.
You don't need to waste any.

380
00:21:50,048 --> 00:21:54,782
It's really painful, Ron. It requires sticking
a large-bore needle into your hip bone.

381
00:21:54,854 --> 00:21:55,843
The pressure...

382
00:21:55,922 --> 00:22:00,018
The sooner you do it,
the sooner it gets done.

383
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,353
All right. I'm going to need you
to lay on your stomach.

384
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:13,467
Thank you.
- No big deal.

385
00:22:14,675 --> 00:22:18,076
Well, yes, it is. It's a very big deal.

386
00:22:18,579 --> 00:22:20,069
You'd do the same thing for me.

387
00:22:25,085 --> 00:22:26,074
Okay.

388
00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:35,997
I'm going to need you to hold really still.

389
00:22:42,771 --> 00:22:43,965
Ready?

390
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:58,108
That was a joke.

391
00:22:59,355 --> 00:23:00,344
Just kidding...

392
00:23:00,423 --> 00:23:02,414
Okay, well, knock it off.

393
00:23:05,695 --> 00:23:06,684
Okay, okay.

394
00:23:34,592 --> 00:23:36,719
The Colonel said you and Dr. Rush
were working on something

395
00:23:36,794 --> 00:23:38,159
with the communication device?

396
00:23:38,229 --> 00:23:39,218
Yeah, no luck.

397
00:23:39,931 --> 00:23:42,024
Okay, so what's next?

398
00:23:42,467 --> 00:23:44,298
We're kind of running out of time here.

399
00:23:44,402 --> 00:23:46,666
- Matt?
- Chloe?

400
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,235
She's switching back and forth
more frequently now.

401
00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:52,436
How you feeling?

402
00:23:53,078 --> 00:23:54,067
Weird.

403
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,469
Tired.

404
00:23:55,714 --> 00:23:57,443
This whole thing's affecting both of them.

405
00:23:58,417 --> 00:24:00,351
Am I still connected to Ginn?

406
00:24:00,486 --> 00:24:02,579
- Yeah.
But Rush is working on it.

407
00:24:02,655 --> 00:24:04,589
We're gonna figure this out.

408
00:24:04,823 --> 00:24:05,847
Is she all right?

409
00:24:06,392 --> 00:24:07,484
Yeah.

410
00:24:08,827 --> 00:24:11,091
Well, she's fading.

411
00:24:11,965 --> 00:24:14,195
We're trying to figure out a way
to preserve her consciousness

412
00:24:14,267 --> 00:24:16,064
without harming you.

413
00:24:16,136 --> 00:24:19,537
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.
Do what you need to do to help her.

414
00:24:19,606 --> 00:24:22,598
No, not at the risk of hurting you.
I won't let that happen.

415
00:24:24,177 --> 00:24:26,304
No one will let that happen.

416
00:24:27,948 --> 00:24:29,848
Did we switch again?

417
00:24:33,821 --> 00:24:34,810
Ginn.

418
00:24:35,856 --> 00:24:38,654
I'm sorry,
will you excuse us a second?

419
00:24:46,834 --> 00:24:48,961
Look, how long is this gonna go on?

420
00:24:49,303 --> 00:24:53,297
- She hasn't had another choking episode.
- Yet. Why risk it?

421
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,834
Look, man, I know you miss her.

422
00:24:55,944 --> 00:24:58,242
I know how much it hurt to lose her.

423
00:24:58,313 --> 00:25:00,543
This isn't about me, Matt.

424
00:25:00,716 --> 00:25:02,081
I'm trying to save two people...

425
00:25:02,184 --> 00:25:03,981
What's going on here?

426
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,241
Chloe?

427
00:25:06,488 --> 00:25:09,321
No. Amanda Perry.

428
00:25:21,004 --> 00:25:21,993
Mandy?

429
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:24,835
Yes, Nick. It's me.

430
00:25:25,408 --> 00:25:30,641
I wondered if you were in there,
if there was any chance that you survived.

431
00:25:40,257 --> 00:25:42,282
We think Dr. Perry has been in there
the whole time,

432
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:44,190
but both she and Ginn are fading.

433
00:25:44,495 --> 00:25:46,463
Chloe's becoming more prominent now.

434
00:25:46,563 --> 00:25:48,394
We're going to have to act
fast on this, Colonel,

435
00:25:48,499 --> 00:25:50,023
otherwise we're going to lose both of them.

436
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:53,669
Amanda's consciousness is already
far weaker than the other two.

437
00:25:54,873 --> 00:25:57,467
All right.
Well, do we have any solutions yet?

438
00:25:57,909 --> 00:25:59,672
Well, I've had no luck
with the communications device,

439
00:25:59,778 --> 00:26:01,871
but I do have another idea.

440
00:26:03,815 --> 00:26:05,214
The neural interface chair.

441
00:26:05,283 --> 00:26:08,878
Now, I believe with that,
we can isolate each consciousness

442
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,883
<i>and upload them into Destiny's
memory bank.</i>

443
00:26:12,858 --> 00:26:13,847
Like Franklin.

444
00:26:14,894 --> 00:26:16,054
Wait, like what?

445
00:26:16,529 --> 00:26:19,692
I've seen and spoken to Dr. Franklin
many times now on the bridge.

446
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:23,568
So that's what happened to him?
He was uploaded to the ship?

447
00:26:23,636 --> 00:26:26,571
<i>Well, I can't say for certain, but I do
know that Destiny has a neural link</i>

448
00:26:26,672 --> 00:26:30,335
with the people on board this ship.
It's caused us to see things before.

449
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:33,011
Are you seeing him now?

450
00:26:34,614 --> 00:26:35,603
No.

451
00:26:36,183 --> 00:26:38,777
I managed to sever the link
shortly after your experience

452
00:26:38,885 --> 00:26:40,682
with the alien battle simulations.

453
00:26:41,221 --> 00:26:42,745
Always the chair with you.

454
00:26:43,056 --> 00:26:44,614
Well, you asked for a solution.

455
00:26:44,791 --> 00:26:47,157
Well, it didn't work the first time
when Chloe was becoming an alien.

456
00:26:47,227 --> 00:26:49,991
Yeah, this is different.
I know what we're dealing with here.

457
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:53,567
- So there's no danger to Chloe at all?
- I didn't say that! Did I say that?

458
00:26:54,736 --> 00:26:56,431
I'm going to have to remove
some of the safeguards

459
00:26:56,504 --> 00:27:00,565
I put into the chair's programming, yes,
but I've done the calculations.

460
00:27:01,242 --> 00:27:02,641
The chances of her being harmed
are minimal.

461
00:27:03,444 --> 00:27:06,436
Colonel, this is not our decision to make.

462
00:27:31,508 --> 00:27:34,136
You know, guys,
I've got to go stretch my legs.

463
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,871
- I'll be back in a couple of minutes, okay?
- Yeah.

464
00:27:45,255 --> 00:27:47,815
I have never liked hospitals or doctors.

465
00:27:48,158 --> 00:27:54,029
Well, this is not a hospital
and T.J. is no doctor, so you're fine.

466
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:56,425
Thanks, that's comforting.

467
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:57,895
Mmm-hmm.

468
00:27:58,235 --> 00:28:01,568
All things considered, though,
I wouldn't want to be anywhere else.

469
00:28:04,675 --> 00:28:07,007
- I hear that.
- Yeah, I miss home.

470
00:28:07,912 --> 00:28:12,782
Sitting in the backyard,
warm summer night, sippin' a beer,

471
00:28:14,186 --> 00:28:16,484
staring at the stars through my telescope,
you know.

472
00:28:19,658 --> 00:28:21,455
I love that backyard.

473
00:28:30,769 --> 00:28:31,964
All right.

474
00:28:32,338 --> 00:28:33,828
You sure?

475
00:28:34,106 --> 00:28:38,668
Yeah, I don't want to disconnect the stone
and risk losing them forever.

476
00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:41,946
We need to do this.

477
00:28:42,615 --> 00:28:44,378
Whatever it takes to help them.

478
00:28:45,885 --> 00:28:46,977
Okay.

479
00:28:53,627 --> 00:28:58,155
Hey, T.J., I just stopped by the infirmary.
Volker looks worse.

480
00:29:00,367 --> 00:29:02,665
I know he and Greer are ready to do this.

481
00:29:06,373 --> 00:29:07,397
I know you're scared.

482
00:29:07,474 --> 00:29:11,377
This is a major surgery.
It is complicated, and it's dangerous.

483
00:29:11,446 --> 00:29:12,811
And if you do nothing, Volker dies.

484
00:29:12,881 --> 00:29:14,508
I do the surgery, and they both could die.

485
00:29:14,616 --> 00:29:16,880
That is a risk that both men have accepted.

486
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,045
Listen to me.

487
00:29:19,454 --> 00:29:21,479
I'm not gonna order you to do this

488
00:29:21,556 --> 00:29:23,820
because you know that it needs to be done,

489
00:29:24,058 --> 00:29:26,959
and you know that you are
the only person who can do it.

490
00:29:38,107 --> 00:29:41,736
It's not permanent, Mandy,

491
00:29:42,778 --> 00:29:49,445
but my hope is to find a way
of putting you into another body.

492
00:29:52,389 --> 00:29:53,879
A fresh start.

493
00:29:58,161 --> 00:30:00,459
That's been my dream
ever since the accident.

494
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,511
Where'd they go?

495
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,569
Who?

496
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,341
Oh!

497
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:30,983
Wow.

498
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,532
This place has really filled out.

499
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:42,796
As close to a backyard
as we're gonna find on this ship.

500
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:55,945
You and me? We're gonna be fine.

501
00:30:56,723 --> 00:30:57,985
You can trust that.

502
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:00,290
<i>Greer, where
the hell are you?</i>

503
00:31:02,495 --> 00:31:04,122
Took a little walk, T.J.

504
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:06,398
Gettin' some fresh air.

505
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:07,788
<i>Is Volker with you?</i>

506
00:31:13,574 --> 00:31:15,098
Yes, I am.

507
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:28,213
<i>A SPACE OD YSSEYTHEME PLAYING)</i>

508
00:31:38,933 --> 00:31:41,094
I thought a little music
might help you relax.

509
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:44,397
<i>The theme to 2001?</i>

510
00:31:44,472 --> 00:31:45,496
Ah!

511
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:50,507
It's not very relaxing, is it?

512
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,504
No.

513
00:32:18,708 --> 00:32:19,697
You ready?

514
00:32:32,824 --> 00:32:33,813
How will I exist?

515
00:32:35,126 --> 00:32:38,357
<i>You'll live inside Destiny's
computer system.</i>

516
00:32:39,363 --> 00:32:42,457
You'll be a part of the ship. Literally.

517
00:32:44,535 --> 00:32:47,800
And when I'm switched off,
what will happen to me then?

518
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,533
Now, that can't happen.

519
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,609
The only thing that we can
switch on and off

520
00:32:51,677 --> 00:32:53,508
is the ability to communicate with you.

521
00:32:57,316 --> 00:32:59,910
Remember, this is only temporary.

522
00:33:01,587 --> 00:33:03,987
The SGC knows of alien races

523
00:33:04,089 --> 00:33:07,547
with the ability to download
a consciousness into a host body.

524
00:33:07,826 --> 00:33:10,420
Hell, the Ancient database
may even have information on it.

525
00:33:10,496 --> 00:33:14,490
We just need to find it and figure out
a way to do it here, on the ship.

526
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:20,832
I know it isn't perfect,
but we can be together.

527
00:33:25,812 --> 00:33:31,308
Just to see you, talk to you,
hear your voice.

528
00:33:34,188 --> 00:33:35,985
It can be enough.

529
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:41,717
Can't it?

530
00:33:49,003 --> 00:33:49,992
Ginn?

531
00:33:51,306 --> 00:33:54,833
Okay, right there, that's the lumbar
vein coming off the back of the renal vein.

532
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,400
You want to cut that.

533
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:05,308
Okay, got it.

534
00:34:09,491 --> 00:34:11,926
<i>T.J., have you started
the surgery yet?</i>

535
00:34:12,128 --> 00:34:13,789
Yes, sir, about 30 minutes ago.

536
00:34:14,163 --> 00:34:17,030
<i>- Ginn had another choking attack.
Is she all right?</i>

537
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:20,466
Yeah, she's okay.
It passed, but I'm not waiting any longer.

538
00:34:20,536 --> 00:34:21,901
We've got to do the transfer now.

539
00:34:22,772 --> 00:34:25,639
<i>I'm going to be here another
four or five hours, sir. I can't leave.</i>

540
00:34:25,708 --> 00:34:28,438
All right, well, keep going. We'll manage.

541
00:34:29,545 --> 00:34:30,637
Copy.

542
00:34:41,425 --> 00:34:42,858
Go ahead.

543
00:34:52,036 --> 00:34:53,731
Okay. Ready?

544
00:34:55,306 --> 00:34:56,898
Get the retractors, please?

545
00:35:00,245 --> 00:35:01,405
I want you to pull up.

546
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:31,441
All right, I'm reading two energy
signatures, each separate from Chloe's.

547
00:35:31,511 --> 00:35:33,536
Now, are we sure that that one's Chloe's?

548
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,372
Well, it appears to be
the dominant presence,

549
00:35:35,448 --> 00:35:37,040
so I think we can safely assume
that it's Chloe.

550
00:35:38,051 --> 00:35:39,678
I'm transferring the other two.

551
00:35:42,355 --> 00:35:44,016
- She's choking again!
- Turn it off.

552
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,682
I can't, the transfer's already begun.

553
00:36:02,476 --> 00:36:04,671
- What happened?
I don't know.

554
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,770
<i>Destiny's mainframe
just had a huge power surge.</i>

555
00:36:07,315 --> 00:36:10,512
We lost imaging, database, everything.

556
00:36:17,726 --> 00:36:18,784
What's happening?

557
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,327
Must have been some kind of power surge.

558
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:21,584
Is it still transferring?

559
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,698
I don't know.
The mainframe is inaccessible.

560
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,663
- Anything?
- No, it's crashed.

561
00:36:26,735 --> 00:36:27,929
Why?
- I don't know!

562
00:36:33,643 --> 00:36:35,770
- What, did you fix it?
No.

563
00:36:37,113 --> 00:36:39,980
The ship must have overcome the problem.
At least partially, at any rate.

564
00:36:41,084 --> 00:36:42,881
There's still
several systems malfunctioning.

565
00:36:42,952 --> 00:36:43,941
Well, can you turn the chair off now?

566
00:36:44,053 --> 00:36:45,384
Yeah, but I can't be sure
the transfer's been...

567
00:36:45,488 --> 00:36:47,353
I don't care. Turn the chair off now.

568
00:36:55,466 --> 00:36:57,525
We don't have time! I need to finish this!

569
00:36:57,601 --> 00:37:00,570
Hang on. I think I've got
the ligature device back online.

570
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:02,161
The database is still down.

571
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,608
Tamara?
Who are you?

572
00:37:05,843 --> 00:37:07,606
- What?
- I'm Amanda Perry.

573
00:37:08,312 --> 00:37:09,677
- Dr. Perry, how did you...
- No time to explain.

574
00:37:09,747 --> 00:37:11,238
You need to finish the surgery.

575
00:37:11,316 --> 00:37:13,284
- T.J., what's wrong?
- You're not real.

576
00:37:13,451 --> 00:37:14,440
Listen to me.

577
00:37:14,853 --> 00:37:17,651
I'll help you. I have access
to the entire medical database.

578
00:37:18,823 --> 00:37:20,450
Trust me, Tamara. I can help.

579
00:37:24,562 --> 00:37:26,553
- Okay, tell me what to do.
- Who are you talking to?

580
00:37:27,999 --> 00:37:29,261
No one. I'll tell you later.

581
00:37:29,367 --> 00:37:30,801
- T. J...
I'm fine!

582
00:37:31,003 --> 00:37:32,197
Just let me do this. Go.

583
00:37:32,271 --> 00:37:34,569
All right, the first connection
you need to make

584
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,041
is to the renal vein.
Attach it to the external iliac vein.

585
00:37:40,646 --> 00:37:43,615
- Did it transfer?
- Yeah, I believe so.

586
00:37:44,984 --> 00:37:48,317
<i>Two new programs have suddenly
appeared in Destiny's memory bank.</i>

587
00:37:49,155 --> 00:37:51,818
One of them, in fact,
is active somewhere on the ship right now.

588
00:37:52,626 --> 00:37:53,991
Doing what?

589
00:37:58,999 --> 00:38:00,899
Okay, the artery's attached.

590
00:38:00,967 --> 00:38:02,025
Go ahead and unclamp it.

591
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:06,663
It's pink.

592
00:38:07,574 --> 00:38:08,563
That's good.

593
00:38:17,618 --> 00:38:19,483
That's it. You did it.

594
00:38:43,212 --> 00:38:45,203
- Chloe?
- Yeah.

595
00:38:51,921 --> 00:38:53,411
I'm all right.

596
00:38:54,023 --> 00:38:56,719
Okay... Okay.

597
00:39:00,497 --> 00:39:04,194
So far, so good.
I started the stem cell infusions.

598
00:39:04,267 --> 00:39:07,430
Over time we'll wean him off of it
as he reaches a chimeric state,

599
00:39:07,504 --> 00:39:09,870
but hopefully his body
won't reject the kidney.

600
00:39:09,939 --> 00:39:13,398
- We just have to wait and see.
- He won't reject it.

601
00:39:13,744 --> 00:39:15,075
Great, no pressure.

602
00:39:15,746 --> 00:39:17,805
Hey, you did good.

603
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,840
<i>Colonel Young?</i>

604
00:39:21,986 --> 00:39:24,750
<i>- Yeah, go ahead. - I need you
in the Communications Lab.</i>

605
00:39:30,227 --> 00:39:32,025
- David?
- Yeah, it's me.

606
00:39:32,631 --> 00:39:33,928
We just made the connection.

607
00:39:34,065 --> 00:39:37,034
We had a problem with
the communication device on our end.

608
00:39:37,102 --> 00:39:38,763
Took a few days,
but our guys finally fixed it.

609
00:39:39,471 --> 00:39:40,699
David...

610
00:39:41,172 --> 00:39:43,333
The bomb was defused. Washington is safe.

611
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,185
Nicholas...

612
00:40:01,561 --> 00:40:02,550
It worked.

613
00:40:04,897 --> 00:40:05,886
Thank you.

614
00:40:08,701 --> 00:40:10,294
How do you feel?

615
00:40:14,942 --> 00:40:15,931
Free.

616
00:40:19,446 --> 00:40:20,470
Have you peed yet?

617
00:40:21,014 --> 00:40:22,140
What kind of question is that?

618
00:40:22,249 --> 00:40:24,683
Well, the kidneys clean the blood,
they process the waste...

619
00:40:24,785 --> 00:40:28,812
No, I know what they do, for...
Yes. I've... Yes, okay?

620
00:40:29,056 --> 00:40:30,148
- Good.
- Good.

621
00:40:30,491 --> 00:40:34,359
Hey, you need to walk,
just a little bit around the infirmary.

622
00:40:34,429 --> 00:40:35,555
Helps the body heal.

623
00:40:41,035 --> 00:40:45,495
Oh, I gotta go. I'm on duty.
I'll stop by later.

624
00:40:48,009 --> 00:40:49,499
I'll help you.

625
00:40:50,279 --> 00:40:51,371
- Are you sure?
- Mmm-hmm.

626
00:40:53,415 --> 00:40:54,404
All right.

627
00:40:56,685 --> 00:40:59,051
There might be a little infection
setting in there.

628
00:41:00,823 --> 00:41:02,085
I'm fine.

629
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:08,189
Yeah. No, I know.
Just gonna change the dressing.

630
00:41:26,216 --> 00:41:27,478
I was getting worried.

631
00:41:28,351 --> 00:41:30,980
I saw your consciousness
in the memory bank,

632
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:34,591
but you hadn't appeared to anyone yet,
so I didn't know what to think.

633
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:38,720
I know it's only temporary.

634
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,458
It is. I promise,

635
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:46,228
but for now, it's the best we can do.

636
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,366
I've thought about what you said.

637
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:57,346
Just being here, seeing you,
hearing your voice...

638
00:42:00,085 --> 00:42:01,074
It is enough.

639
00:43:38,288 --> 00:43:39,277
English - US - SDH
