1
00:00:04,225 --> 00:00:09,094
<i>I may be on the verge of discovering
the true nature of Destiny's mission.</i>

2
00:00:10,063 --> 00:00:13,055
<i>You've had control of this ship
the whole time!</i>

3
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:14,498
Why wouldn't you tell anyone?

4
00:00:14,567 --> 00:00:17,559
The Lucian Alliance is planning
an attack on Earth.

5
00:00:17,971 --> 00:00:21,235
<i>I killed Riley.
I suffocated him with my own hands.</i>

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,205
You are a good commander.

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,274
<i>There is no mission other
than getting these people home.</i>

8
00:00:26,346 --> 00:00:29,543
<i>It was never about going home, it's
about getting us to where we're going.</i>

9
00:00:29,616 --> 00:00:32,015
That is the mission.

10
00:00:33,051 --> 00:00:36,953
<i>Well, I've just completed a thorough
diagnostic on one of the stasis pods.</i>

11
00:00:37,022 --> 00:00:38,046
Very informative.

12
00:00:38,123 --> 00:00:41,717
We've been searching what we were
able to transfer from the archive.

13
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,989
The ALS cure wasn't in there.

14
00:00:44,495 --> 00:00:48,454
<i>The first symptoms presented
five years after we arrived on the planet.</i>

15
00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:50,057
<i>I died a few years after that.</i>

16
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:51,525
<i>We've got drones, dead ahead.</i>

17
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:52,966
<i>The drones cannot track us,</i>

18
00:00:53,036 --> 00:00:56,005
<i>so instead, they've blockaded the stars
from which Destiny recharges.</i>

19
00:00:56,072 --> 00:00:57,903
<i>This could be it,
the end of the line.</i>

20
00:00:58,275 --> 00:01:00,607
<i>There's new hybrids in the
dome we could lose forever.</i>

21
00:01:00,943 --> 00:01:03,003
The hydroponic dome's been breached.

22
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,005
<i>Flash blindness.
Hopefully it's temporary.</i>

23
00:01:06,082 --> 00:01:07,777
I can't see!

24
00:01:10,887 --> 00:01:12,854
- How you feeling?
- Oh. Great.

25
00:01:13,022 --> 00:01:16,287
I haven't had this much rest in weeks.
I never thought I'd say this,

26
00:01:16,392 --> 00:01:19,088
but I'm actually looking forward to
getting bleary-eyed analyzing data.

27
00:01:21,396 --> 00:01:22,761
Well, let's see where we're at.

28
00:01:24,065 --> 00:01:27,296
I've been seeing occasional flashes of light.
I think that's a good sign, right?

29
00:01:29,437 --> 00:01:31,666
Okay. Open your eyes.

30
00:01:37,044 --> 00:01:38,238
Lisa?

31
00:01:40,215 --> 00:01:43,308
It's still dark. I can't see.

32
00:01:48,755 --> 00:01:50,120
Anything?

33
00:01:52,091 --> 00:01:53,456
No.

34
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,300
Colonel, you got a second?

35
00:02:11,376 --> 00:02:12,467
Can it wait?

36
00:02:12,543 --> 00:02:14,306
- You look terrible.
- Thank you.

37
00:02:14,378 --> 00:02:16,676
You're running yourself ragged, okay?
Get some rest.

38
00:02:16,747 --> 00:02:18,181
Way ahead of you. That's where I'm going.

39
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,512
<i>Colonel Young, this is Rush.
Come in.</i>

40
00:02:19,584 --> 00:02:22,314
Ignore that.
You're no good to us exhausted.

41
00:02:22,387 --> 00:02:23,978
<i>Colonel Young?</i>

42
00:02:24,054 --> 00:02:25,043
This is Young.

43
00:02:25,723 --> 00:02:27,714
<i>Could you join us in the
Control Interface Room, please?</i>

44
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,986
<i>We've something we want to show you.</i>

45
00:02:31,395 --> 00:02:33,328
- We did it.
- Fantastic.

46
00:02:33,396 --> 00:02:34,420
What'd they do?

47
00:02:34,497 --> 00:02:35,555
I have no idea.

48
00:02:35,632 --> 00:02:38,726
We found a way to track the
command ships that control the drones.

49
00:02:39,068 --> 00:02:40,092
How?

50
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:42,262
We managed to isolate
the subspace signals

51
00:02:42,338 --> 00:02:43,770
they use to communicate with each other.

52
00:02:44,106 --> 00:02:48,634
<i>Then we plugged the data into Destiny's
long-range sensors, and it worked.</i>

53
00:02:49,177 --> 00:02:50,667
So we know where they are.

54
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:53,979
Then we can avoid them
and find safe planets to resupply.

55
00:02:54,148 --> 00:02:56,447
That was the idea, anyway.

56
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,577
Let's see it.

57
00:03:04,025 --> 00:03:08,291
This is the path that the seed ships
plotted for us through this galaxy.

58
00:03:09,297 --> 00:03:11,561
These are the upcoming gates,

59
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:15,666
and these are the command ships.

60
00:03:16,002 --> 00:03:17,435
Oh, my God.

61
00:03:17,504 --> 00:03:20,064
Look, we've pushed this
as far as sensor capability will allow,

62
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,471
and the results are the same.

63
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,775
As far as we can tell,

64
00:03:23,843 --> 00:03:26,402
they're waiting at every gate between here
and the edge of the galaxy.

65
00:03:29,114 --> 00:03:30,672
We're screwed.

66
00:03:50,101 --> 00:03:51,659
Colonel Young?

67
00:03:51,736 --> 00:03:53,294
No, I'm Rush, this is Young.

68
00:03:53,371 --> 00:03:54,736
Colonel Telford's waiting for you.

69
00:03:55,272 --> 00:03:56,864
You sure your sensor data is accurate?

70
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,437
Of course it is.

71
00:03:59,276 --> 00:04:00,766
And they're at every single gate?

72
00:04:00,844 --> 00:04:02,744
Well, they've figured out how we operate.

73
00:04:02,813 --> 00:04:04,474
They know which stars we use to recharge,

74
00:04:04,548 --> 00:04:06,276
they know that we use the gate
to resupply.

75
00:04:06,482 --> 00:04:08,177
They're everywhere we want to be
along that path.

76
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,844
So go off the path. Use the shuttles
and check out ungated worlds.

77
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,017
We can't do that. There's over 300
billion stars in that galaxy.

78
00:04:15,492 --> 00:04:17,686
Only a small percentage of them
have planets.

79
00:04:18,027 --> 00:04:20,757
An even smaller percentage
are capable of sustaining life.

80
00:04:21,731 --> 00:04:23,892
The seed ships did the legwork.

81
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,326
They found the needles in the haystack.

82
00:04:26,401 --> 00:04:28,062
If we go off on our own,
it could be months,

83
00:04:28,136 --> 00:04:31,628
maybe even years, between viable worlds.
It's not an option.

84
00:04:32,574 --> 00:04:34,201
What's your supply situation?

85
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:37,107
We're looking at about
a month's worth of food and water.

86
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,741
- What about power?
- We'll die of thirst

87
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:39,904
before that becomes an issue.

88
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,744
We could really use
a supply line from home, David.

89
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:45,410
Well, the only planet we know of
with the power requirements to reach you

90
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:46,747
is still refusing to help.

91
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,719
Woolsey is still pushing diplomacy,
but he's not making much progress.

92
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,615
Whatever the solution is

93
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:55,362
you're gonna have to make it happen
on your own.

94
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:04,198
Hey. I'm collecting inventory reports.

95
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,397
Guess it could be a while
before we can use the gate again.

96
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,733
So I hear.

97
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,274
We're actually in pretty good shape
down here for the moment.

98
00:05:15,947 --> 00:05:17,880
Matt told me about Lisa.

99
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,175
Do you think her condition's permanent?

100
00:05:21,485 --> 00:05:22,713
I don't know. I mean,

101
00:05:22,787 --> 00:05:24,846
there should have been
some progress by now.

102
00:05:26,123 --> 00:05:27,384
It's not your fault.

103
00:05:27,624 --> 00:05:28,819
You don't have the right equipment,

104
00:05:28,893 --> 00:05:29,917
the resources...

105
00:05:29,994 --> 00:05:31,757
Even if I did, it wouldn't
make a difference.

106
00:05:32,463 --> 00:05:34,192
There's no treatment.

107
00:05:34,698 --> 00:05:37,428
Her corneas were burned
by ultraviolet radiation.

108
00:05:37,501 --> 00:05:39,661
If they don't heal on their own...

109
00:05:41,237 --> 00:05:42,568
Well, I know it seems unfair,

110
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,131
but sometimes you just have to
play the hand that you're dealt.

111
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,909
Why do I get the feeling
you're not just talking about Lisa?

112
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:55,880
There's still hope.

113
00:05:56,084 --> 00:05:57,984
For her and for you.

114
00:06:00,822 --> 00:06:04,417
ALS is a death sentence, Chloe,
you know that,

115
00:06:05,927 --> 00:06:08,260
and it's not gonna be pretty.

116
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,264
It'll start with
muscle weakness and cramping.

117
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,760
Then I'll have trouble walking, talking,
feeding myself,

118
00:06:19,306 --> 00:06:22,241
and eventually, full paralysis will set in,

119
00:06:22,976 --> 00:06:25,240
but my mind will be unaffected.

120
00:06:26,913 --> 00:06:30,643
I'll be a prisoner
trapped inside my own body.

121
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,784
Like I said,

122
00:06:32,852 --> 00:06:35,218
you play the hand you're dealt.

123
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,619
- So, no help from home.
- No.

124
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,558
Well, that doesn't leave us
with many options.

125
00:06:43,628 --> 00:06:45,756
Well, we can't run, we can't hide,
we'll have to fight.

126
00:06:46,398 --> 00:06:48,195
There's a lot of them out there.

127
00:06:48,267 --> 00:06:49,790
We don't have to take on all of them.

128
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,769
Just as many as we have to
in order to resupply when necessary.

129
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:54,863
That's still a pretty tall order

130
00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:57,032
considering we've only taken out
one of their command ships.

131
00:06:57,108 --> 00:06:58,405
And that was with help.

132
00:06:58,476 --> 00:07:01,069
Well, we do have the element of surprise
now we're able to track them.

133
00:07:03,347 --> 00:07:04,371
Okay,

134
00:07:05,048 --> 00:07:07,141
we choose a target, drop out of FTL,

135
00:07:07,217 --> 00:07:09,617
and open fire
before it's got a chance to respond.

136
00:07:09,686 --> 00:07:12,017
But what if it does manage a response?

137
00:07:12,088 --> 00:07:13,487
Well, if we don't destroy it immediately,

138
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:16,285
we can at least cause enough damage
to gain a huge advantage.

139
00:07:16,359 --> 00:07:18,953
So, let's say this works once,
maybe even twice,

140
00:07:19,028 --> 00:07:22,053
but we're going to start taking damage,
and it's going to take its toll.

141
00:07:23,165 --> 00:07:25,963
Well, we find a way
to minimize that damage.

142
00:07:26,135 --> 00:07:28,865
Yeah? And I suppose you've got an idea
on how we manage that.

143
00:07:30,106 --> 00:07:31,402
As a matter of fact,

144
00:07:32,507 --> 00:07:33,997
I do.

145
00:07:39,681 --> 00:07:41,910
So you're saying we dial up the shields?

146
00:07:41,982 --> 00:07:42,971
Well, no, not exactly.

147
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,951
- It's more like we tune them.
When we're in battle,

148
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,716
the shields continuously cycle
through various frequencies

149
00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:51,682
in the hopes of matching
incoming energy-based attacks.

150
00:07:52,025 --> 00:07:54,425
The closer the match,
the easier the attack is to absorb

151
00:07:54,494 --> 00:07:56,428
and, consequently,
the less damage we take.

152
00:07:56,496 --> 00:07:58,828
It's a guessing game,
like rock, paper, scissors.

153
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:02,101
But in the case of the drones,
we don't have to guess.

154
00:08:02,168 --> 00:08:06,070
Thanks to someone's brilliant idea
to bring one onboard.

155
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:08,937
The energy signature of their weapons
is a fairly limited range.

156
00:08:09,008 --> 00:08:10,498
We can target specifically for it.

157
00:08:10,977 --> 00:08:14,173
<i>We just need to override Destiny's
normal randomized shield pattern.</i>

158
00:08:14,246 --> 00:08:16,339
And paper covers rock every time.

159
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,475
<i>If all Destiny has to do
is find the right match,</i>

160
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:21,519
why does it bother cycling
in the first place?

161
00:08:21,587 --> 00:08:24,077
Because matching and maintaining
a single specific pattern

162
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:26,885
makes it vulnerable
to all other forms of attack.

163
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:32,020
Right, like if they throw scissors,
and we're guessing rock.

164
00:08:32,162 --> 00:08:34,426
- Not to push the analogy too far.
- Too late.

165
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:36,658
So if we are wrong,
it would be like we have no shields at all?

166
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:38,325
We're not wrong.

167
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:47,609
Main weapon is charged and ready.

168
00:08:48,378 --> 00:08:51,176
Rush, what's your status?

169
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:54,408
<i>Looks like Destiny's accepting our override.
Shields are at maximum.</i>

170
00:08:54,483 --> 00:08:56,781
<i>Modulation is limited
within target range.</i>

171
00:09:05,226 --> 00:09:07,786
Who calculated the FTL jump?
Chloe.

172
00:09:07,895 --> 00:09:09,089
Think we'll come out in range?

173
00:09:09,163 --> 00:09:12,724
Well, it's a bit like trying to hit a dime
with a bullet from 1,000 yards,

174
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,494
but she's pretty good.

175
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,934
What is that?

176
00:09:25,012 --> 00:09:27,139
- Collision alarms. We're about to hit!
- Hold on!

177
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:46,388
I take it back, she is very, very good.

178
00:09:46,464 --> 00:09:48,022
We've got incoming.

179
00:09:53,672 --> 00:09:56,197
It's working.
Their weapons are having almost no effect.

180
00:09:56,274 --> 00:09:57,400
Concentrate on the command ship.

181
00:09:57,475 --> 00:09:58,499
<i>Ignore the drones.</i>

182
00:09:58,576 --> 00:09:59,907
I don't have a shot!

183
00:09:59,978 --> 00:10:01,206
Working on it.

184
00:10:11,021 --> 00:10:13,353
The command ship is damaged,
but still operational.

185
00:10:13,424 --> 00:10:15,482
Bringing us around again.

186
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:21,554
What's that?
- The shields just dropped 10%.

187
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:26,893
What's going on? All of a sudden
their shots are getting through!

188
00:10:28,704 --> 00:10:30,137
That's not weapons fire.

189
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:44,476
It's the drones. They're flying right into us.
It's a kamikaze run!

190
00:10:44,786 --> 00:10:47,083
Shields are down to half and still dropping.

191
00:10:47,154 --> 00:10:48,883
We've lost power in multiple sections.

192
00:10:48,956 --> 00:10:51,254
I'm down three gun positions.
I can't hold them off.

193
00:10:51,325 --> 00:10:52,587
Forget it, there's too many, anyway!

194
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,389
Just give me another crack
at that command ship.

195
00:10:54,462 --> 00:10:56,452
She's trying to outmaneuver us.
I need some more time.

196
00:10:56,529 --> 00:10:58,190
We don't have it. Shields are failing.

197
00:11:10,342 --> 00:11:11,401
Almost there.

198
00:11:13,747 --> 00:11:14,771
We got them.

199
00:11:23,255 --> 00:11:26,349
Direct hit.
The command ship's been destroyed.

200
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:28,119
Looks like the drones have gone dormant.

201
00:11:28,192 --> 00:11:30,786
Away teams to the shuttles,
let's make this quick.

202
00:11:30,862 --> 00:11:33,660
We don't want to stay here
any longer than we have to. Go.

203
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,428
We can't do this
every time we need to resupply.

204
00:11:42,506 --> 00:11:44,804
No. We need another plan.

205
00:11:51,515 --> 00:11:52,812
Second shuttle just docked.

206
00:11:52,883 --> 00:11:55,215
I guess they found a few edibles,
but the pickings were pretty slim.

207
00:11:55,285 --> 00:11:57,014
Get us out of here.

208
00:12:04,994 --> 00:12:07,053
Colonel, do you have a minute?

209
00:12:07,163 --> 00:12:08,959
Well, I know it sounds
like a crazy idea, Eli,

210
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,827
but I was actually thinking
of getting some sleep,

211
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:14,232
so unless you have some genius idea
that solves all our problems...

212
00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:16,002
As a matter of fact, I do,

213
00:12:16,271 --> 00:12:18,329
but you're not gonna like it.

214
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:22,873
Well, that goes without saying.
I am notoriously hard to please,

215
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:26,746
- so let's hear it.
- Okay.

216
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:30,207
Another day, another galaxy.

217
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,614
What the hell does that mean?

218
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:36,986
<i>This is just one of 1,000 galaxies
in Destiny's path,</i>

219
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:39,718
and I think you'll agree it's turned out
to be something of a hostile environment.

220
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:40,816
So?

221
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,219
So, we skip it.

222
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:46,529
One continuous FTL jump

223
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:50,323
out and around the length of this galaxy,
across the gap to the next one,

224
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,370
until we've reached
the first gate on the other side.

225
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,267
How long's that going to take?

226
00:12:55,273 --> 00:12:58,003
That's the part you're not gonna like.

227
00:12:58,909 --> 00:13:01,969
We're only about
a third of the way through this galaxy,

228
00:13:02,046 --> 00:13:05,174
plus the gap to the next one
is quite a bit larger than last time.

229
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:07,878
On top of that, thanks to
the ass-kicking that was just handed to us,

230
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,579
we've got power issues,

231
00:13:09,653 --> 00:13:14,420
and some not insignificant damage to the
FTL drive that we won't have time to fix,

232
00:13:14,491 --> 00:13:16,789
which means we'll be operating
at reduced speed, which means

233
00:13:16,861 --> 00:13:18,419
- we might actually run out of...
- Eli!

234
00:13:18,762 --> 00:13:19,785
How long?

235
00:13:20,296 --> 00:13:22,730
Three years, give or take.

236
00:13:25,335 --> 00:13:26,359
Three years?

237
00:13:27,003 --> 00:13:28,300
We barely have enough for a month.

238
00:13:28,371 --> 00:13:31,203
What do you suggest we do for food
and water while all this is happening?

239
00:13:31,273 --> 00:13:32,331
Nothing.

240
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:37,269
That's the genius part, by the way.

241
00:13:41,515 --> 00:13:44,952
Once you're sealed inside the stasis pod,
your metabolism shuts down.

242
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,922
You don't need food or water. Basically,
you just sleep through the whole thing.

243
00:13:48,991 --> 00:13:51,481
And we've found
several other corridors like this one.

244
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:53,584
There should be enough for everybody.

245
00:13:53,694 --> 00:13:57,721
And thanks to the research
that Brody and I have already done,

246
00:13:57,999 --> 00:13:59,261
we know they work.

247
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,030
Three years.

248
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:03,262
- Give or take.
- You keep saying that.

249
00:14:03,336 --> 00:14:05,736
What Eli is neglecting to mention

250
00:14:05,805 --> 00:14:10,003
is that a jump like this is going to
require every last ounce of power we have,

251
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,268
and if his calculations are off...

252
00:14:12,344 --> 00:14:14,437
- They're not.
- And we fall short even by a fraction,

253
00:14:14,513 --> 00:14:16,777
- a tenth of one percent...
- We won't.

254
00:14:16,882 --> 00:14:19,544
Then we're going to drift
the rest of the way,

255
00:14:19,618 --> 00:14:21,346
and instead of three years,

256
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:24,412
it'll take 1,000 or more.

257
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,253
I assume you were going to
get to that part.

258
00:14:27,393 --> 00:14:30,760
Look, I've run the numbers.
This could work.

259
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,186
But we have to do it soon.

260
00:14:32,263 --> 00:14:34,458
We're bleeding power
from a dozen systems,

261
00:14:34,532 --> 00:14:36,397
and we can't risk
dropping out to recharge...

262
00:14:36,467 --> 00:14:39,800
Too many things that could go wrong.
We have to find another way.

263
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,105
All right, uh...

264
00:14:43,307 --> 00:14:45,639
How long would it take you
to prep the rest of these pods?

265
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,871
A day, maybe.

266
00:14:48,745 --> 00:14:49,837
Get to work.

267
00:14:54,517 --> 00:14:56,041
- Colonel...
- You've got 24 hours

268
00:14:56,118 --> 00:14:57,915
to come up with a better idea.

269
00:15:00,624 --> 00:15:01,784
<i>Three years?</i>

270
00:15:02,024 --> 00:15:04,618
Yeah, that's in a best-case scenario.

271
00:15:05,127 --> 00:15:09,188
The thought of being sealed
in one of those things for so long,

272
00:15:09,265 --> 00:15:10,789
it kind of creeps me out.

273
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:14,562
I don't like it much, either, but
we're quickly running out of options.

274
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:15,963
Well, if we're going to do this,

275
00:15:16,037 --> 00:15:19,666
I recommend that everyone be permitted
a final visit to Earth.

276
00:15:20,141 --> 00:15:21,608
Say their goodbyes.

277
00:15:21,776 --> 00:15:25,176
All right, you make the arrangements,
but it's gonna have to be pretty quick.

278
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:27,479
We pretty much have to
shut down everything to make this work,

279
00:15:27,548 --> 00:15:31,279
and if we take too long,
we're going to run out of power.

280
00:15:49,802 --> 00:15:51,099
Bollocks.

281
00:15:54,606 --> 00:15:56,733
How's it going?
- Huh?

282
00:16:01,146 --> 00:16:02,408
It's not.

283
00:16:03,814 --> 00:16:06,339
For what it's worth,
I went over Eli's numbers.

284
00:16:07,184 --> 00:16:09,880
It's true there's not much margin for
error, but I think it might just work.

285
00:16:09,954 --> 00:16:11,012
Yeah, if we're lucky.

286
00:16:11,822 --> 00:16:14,915
<i>Destiny is on
this path for a reason.</i>

287
00:16:15,325 --> 00:16:16,452
We've only strayed from it once,

288
00:16:16,527 --> 00:16:18,859
and that's what caused
all this trouble in the first place.

289
00:16:18,929 --> 00:16:20,829
But we're not going off the path.

290
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:23,264
At least not for good.
We're just skipping part of it.

291
00:16:23,334 --> 00:16:25,028
Yeah, but that's what bothers me.

292
00:16:25,535 --> 00:16:27,833
This ship was launched to solve a mystery,

293
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,839
not by arriving
at some ultimate destination

294
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,068
where all the questions
are answered at one time,

295
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:36,143
but by accumulating knowledge bit by bit.

296
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:37,739
We skip over this galaxy,

297
00:16:37,813 --> 00:16:41,010
then who's to say we won't skip over
some vital piece of the puzzle,

298
00:16:41,283 --> 00:16:43,979
and then all of this,
everything we've been through

299
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:46,145
will be for nothing.

300
00:16:47,989 --> 00:16:49,149
There's got to be a way to defeat them.

301
00:16:49,223 --> 00:16:52,750
- I just need more time.
- Which we don't have. Look,

302
00:16:53,061 --> 00:16:56,861
you're right, if we go into those pods,
we're taking a chance.

303
00:16:56,931 --> 00:16:58,023
We might miss something

304
00:16:58,866 --> 00:17:00,697
or we might sleep
a lot longer than we planned,

305
00:17:00,768 --> 00:17:02,599
and never see our loved ones again.

306
00:17:02,837 --> 00:17:07,034
<i>Or we might never wake up at all,
but Destiny will keep going.</i>

307
00:17:07,974 --> 00:17:10,169
If we stay, and we don't find
a way to defeat the drones,

308
00:17:10,243 --> 00:17:12,040
we'll all be killed,

309
00:17:12,112 --> 00:17:14,205
and this ship will be destroyed,

310
00:17:14,414 --> 00:17:17,576
and then this really will have
all been for nothing.

311
00:17:22,354 --> 00:17:23,821
<i>Colonel, this is Brody.</i>

312
00:17:23,889 --> 00:17:26,948
<i>We're ready to put
the first group into stasis.</i>

313
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:35,460
Please just step into your assigned pods.

314
00:17:35,534 --> 00:17:37,831
Don't worry,
I'll be monitoring your progress.

315
00:17:45,009 --> 00:17:46,168
See you soon.

316
00:17:47,778 --> 00:17:48,836
Soon.

317
00:18:11,968 --> 00:18:13,094
It's me, Mom.

318
00:18:16,239 --> 00:18:17,364
Eli.

319
00:18:18,874 --> 00:18:20,432
I don't have much time.

320
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,672
Just long enough to say goodbye.

321
00:18:27,281 --> 00:18:29,146
We've got smart people working on it.

322
00:18:29,216 --> 00:18:33,550
Really smart, but still, three years.

323
00:18:34,221 --> 00:18:36,246
Even if it all goes well,

324
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,624
three years at least.

325
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:41,157
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, Eli...

326
00:18:41,227 --> 00:18:44,822
I can't help thinking that if I had made
different choices in my life,

327
00:18:44,898 --> 00:18:46,195
you wouldn't be alone right now.

328
00:18:46,266 --> 00:18:48,062
If you had made different choices,

329
00:18:48,133 --> 00:18:51,160
you wouldn't have seen
the incredible sights you've seen,

330
00:18:51,237 --> 00:18:53,865
done the amazing things you've done.

331
00:18:54,474 --> 00:18:56,669
I feel like I've abandoned you.

332
00:18:57,243 --> 00:18:59,301
You haven't abandoned me.

333
00:19:00,312 --> 00:19:02,246
You're living your life.

334
00:19:02,714 --> 00:19:04,739
I mean, it was hard when I didn't...

335
00:19:04,816 --> 00:19:08,478
When I didn't know where you were,
or what you were doing,

336
00:19:08,553 --> 00:19:11,078
but now I understand.

337
00:19:13,691 --> 00:19:15,591
You don't have to be here, Eli.

338
00:19:17,161 --> 00:19:19,185
I just need to know.

339
00:19:21,198 --> 00:19:22,688
Are you happy?

340
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:26,067
In spite of everything?

341
00:19:27,004 --> 00:19:30,495
Yeah. I am.

342
00:19:32,576 --> 00:19:34,510
That's good enough for me.

343
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,017
<i>- Volker.
- Yeah.</i>

344
00:19:52,093 --> 00:19:54,152
<i>- You on the bridge?
- Yeah.</i>

345
00:19:54,229 --> 00:19:57,164
Good, I need you to run
a diagnostic for me.

346
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,611
Come in!

347
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,245
What?

348
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:25,784
Well, as you know, we've been powering up
all the stasis pod corridors,

349
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,416
and it's been...

350
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:29,358
It's been going pretty well up until now.

351
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,691
- But...
- What is it?

352
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,956
It's the last section.

353
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,193
It must have taken some damage,

354
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:38,930
possibly even before
we came onboard the ship.

355
00:20:39,437 --> 00:20:44,101
We can't bring those pods online, so...

356
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:49,378
We're not going to have enough
for everyone.

357
00:20:58,088 --> 00:21:00,852
The damaged pods
put us eight short of the total we need.

358
00:21:01,024 --> 00:21:02,048
What's the problem?

359
00:21:02,292 --> 00:21:04,192
Well, the ship's very old,
that's the problem.

360
00:21:04,827 --> 00:21:07,159
All right, we'll try that again.
Can we fix it?

361
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,993
Not with the material we have onboard.

362
00:21:10,066 --> 00:21:11,828
We need something
called palladium hydride.

363
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,869
It's a component of
the high-temperature superconductors

364
00:21:14,936 --> 00:21:16,403
that are critical to the pod systems.

365
00:21:16,538 --> 00:21:17,971
Where do we get this stuff?

366
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,974
In ores in alloy with other metals,

367
00:21:20,342 --> 00:21:23,778
ideally on planets in systems that
have seen substantial meteorite activity.

368
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:25,369
Right, now, we do have
a possible candidate,

369
00:21:25,447 --> 00:21:27,438
and it's locked out for good reason.

370
00:21:27,516 --> 00:21:30,679
The meteorites would make the place
dangerous if not toxic,

371
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:34,118
but there is still
a command ship in the system.

372
00:21:34,188 --> 00:21:36,952
They know nothing
about human physiology

373
00:21:37,024 --> 00:21:41,154
or what makes a planet viable.
They just know there's a gate.

374
00:21:41,228 --> 00:21:43,218
We can still get around the lock-out,
if we want to.

375
00:21:43,963 --> 00:21:45,988
Can we survive another fight?

376
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:48,726
Even if we did,
we'd use up far too much power.

377
00:21:48,802 --> 00:21:50,929
The ship would never make the jump
to the next galaxy,

378
00:21:51,004 --> 00:21:53,699
which kind of defeats the purpose of
going to this planet in the first place.

379
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:54,830
So what are you telling me?

380
00:21:55,007 --> 00:21:57,032
We don't have a choice
but to leave eight people out?

381
00:21:57,643 --> 00:21:58,736
Tell them, "Good luck,

382
00:21:58,878 --> 00:22:00,778
"you've got as long as
the food and water lasts"?

383
00:22:01,614 --> 00:22:02,705
We can't even do that.

384
00:22:03,082 --> 00:22:04,276
The power requirements needed to

385
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:08,514
maintain life support for eight people
for that long would make us fall short.

386
00:22:08,587 --> 00:22:10,919
Whoever stays out would have to...

387
00:22:10,989 --> 00:22:12,149
Kill themselves, yeah.

388
00:22:13,157 --> 00:22:14,681
You have no choice, Colonel.

389
00:22:15,326 --> 00:22:16,520
If you want Eli's plan to work,

390
00:22:16,594 --> 00:22:19,154
you're going to have to
come up with eight names.

391
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,128
It just goes from bad to worse.

392
00:22:24,201 --> 00:22:25,725
So what's Colonel Young decided?

393
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:26,928
He hasn't yet, but...

394
00:22:27,003 --> 00:22:29,528
- Don't even think about it.
- What?

395
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:32,005
Volunteering to be one of the eight.
I know you, Ron.

396
00:22:33,376 --> 00:22:35,936
Maybe I would, if it came to it,

397
00:22:36,011 --> 00:22:38,037
but I wouldn't ask seven others
to do it with me,

398
00:22:38,115 --> 00:22:39,980
and I don't think
Colonel Young would, either.

399
00:22:40,584 --> 00:22:44,041
I mean, the way I see it,
we all came here together and, if need be,

400
00:22:44,653 --> 00:22:46,086
we'll all go out together.

401
00:22:47,289 --> 00:22:48,916
Maybe it won't come to that.

402
00:22:49,325 --> 00:22:50,553
What?

403
00:22:50,626 --> 00:22:52,355
Take me to Colonel Young.

404
00:22:52,428 --> 00:22:54,725
Why? What are you thinking?

405
00:22:56,931 --> 00:23:00,458
We need to fall back to this section
and seal off the surrounding corridors,

406
00:23:00,535 --> 00:23:03,834
shut down life support to those areas
and then re-route power...

407
00:23:03,905 --> 00:23:04,928
Okay, we're here.

408
00:23:05,806 --> 00:23:08,172
- Sergeant?
- Dr. Park has something

409
00:23:08,275 --> 00:23:10,209
she'd like to share.

410
00:23:10,277 --> 00:23:11,471
We'll use a decoy.

411
00:23:11,879 --> 00:23:15,815
We drop off one of our shuttles unmanned,
a short FTL jump from the planet.

412
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:19,477
Then we set it to broadcast
a powerful subspace burst

413
00:23:19,553 --> 00:23:21,612
mimicking a gate dial-out.

414
00:23:21,722 --> 00:23:24,316
It'll take a lot of power
and it might damage a few systems,

415
00:23:24,391 --> 00:23:27,518
but I'm guessing the shuttle
doesn't survive this plan anyway.

416
00:23:27,593 --> 00:23:30,494
No. The command ship will investigate,
taking the drones with it,

417
00:23:30,563 --> 00:23:31,996
and probably attack the shuttle,

418
00:23:32,198 --> 00:23:34,791
but in the meantime,
we take advantage of the distraction

419
00:23:34,866 --> 00:23:37,300
to dial in and get the palladium hydride.

420
00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:39,564
We can recalibrate the shields
on the shuttle

421
00:23:39,638 --> 00:23:41,401
<i>just like we did Destiny,</i>

422
00:23:41,473 --> 00:23:43,065
and remote pilot an evasive course

423
00:23:43,175 --> 00:23:45,642
that'll make it harder for the drones
to connect with a suicide run.

424
00:23:45,743 --> 00:23:49,474
If we are going to sacrifice it anyway,
we can rig the engines to go critical.

425
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,642
Ram it straight into the command ship,
give them a taste of their own medicine.

426
00:23:52,716 --> 00:23:54,742
And we'd still have one shuttle left.

427
00:23:54,953 --> 00:23:57,580
All right, I think it
sounds like a great idea.

428
00:23:57,655 --> 00:23:59,316
Let's do it.

429
00:24:01,392 --> 00:24:03,451
Hey, that's good work, Dr. Park.

430
00:24:14,471 --> 00:24:16,461
All right, we're in position.

431
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:20,565
Rush, this is Young. Launch the shuttle.

432
00:24:29,951 --> 00:24:33,012
Subspace link is in place.
We should be able to get shuttle telemetry,

433
00:24:33,088 --> 00:24:35,579
and access the flight controls
with minimal delay.

434
00:24:35,657 --> 00:24:37,146
<i>Understood.</i>

435
00:24:37,258 --> 00:24:39,556
Get us as far away from here as possible.

436
00:24:48,168 --> 00:24:49,260
You know
what we're looking for, right?

437
00:24:49,336 --> 00:24:52,601
Well, I can identify the rocks,
but we can't test for concentration.

438
00:24:52,672 --> 00:24:55,539
Our best bet is to bring back
as much as possible.

439
00:24:55,609 --> 00:24:56,905
If this works, we should have enough time

440
00:24:56,976 --> 00:24:58,944
to load up
as much as the Kino sled can hold.

441
00:24:59,178 --> 00:25:00,645
And what if it doesn't?

442
00:25:07,819 --> 00:25:09,013
Okay.

443
00:25:09,087 --> 00:25:10,817
I think we're good.

444
00:25:11,924 --> 00:25:13,721
Broadcasting the signal now.

445
00:25:16,495 --> 00:25:18,724
Let's hope they take the bait.

446
00:25:21,332 --> 00:25:23,061
Come on, come on.

447
00:25:33,343 --> 00:25:34,401
That's it.

448
00:25:34,545 --> 00:25:35,944
The command ship
just dropped off the screen.

449
00:25:36,013 --> 00:25:37,980
- They've got to be in hyperspace.
- They're on their way.

450
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,172
Gate Room, this is Young.

451
00:25:39,282 --> 00:25:40,340
<i>Start dialing.</i>

452
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:04,071
This is Gate Room. We have a connection.

453
00:26:04,339 --> 00:26:05,636
<i>Away team is en route.</i>

454
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,799
Start removing
shuttle engine safety protocols.

455
00:26:07,876 --> 00:26:09,706
We're gonna have to time this overload
to the last second.

456
00:26:17,184 --> 00:26:18,912
We got anything?

457
00:26:19,852 --> 00:26:20,910
Screens are clear.

458
00:26:23,222 --> 00:26:24,416
Oh! Hold on.

459
00:26:24,524 --> 00:26:26,152
Command ship
just dropped out near the shuttle.

460
00:26:27,361 --> 00:26:29,385
- They're launching drones.
- Rush, you're on.

461
00:26:30,597 --> 00:26:32,724
Initiating evasive maneuvers.

462
00:26:40,872 --> 00:26:43,170
Barnes, what's our status
with the away team?

463
00:26:43,275 --> 00:26:45,743
They found several impact craters
near the gate.

464
00:26:45,811 --> 00:26:48,075
They've already begun collecting samples.

465
00:26:56,587 --> 00:26:59,385
- Whoa! Watch out.
- It's all right, I've got it. Stabilizing.

466
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:03,255
Initiate the overload.

467
00:27:03,326 --> 00:27:04,624
You sure? If it can't get close enough...

468
00:27:04,695 --> 00:27:06,458
Just do it!

469
00:27:08,966 --> 00:27:11,661
They're launching more drones.
The shuttle doesn't have much time.

470
00:27:15,739 --> 00:27:17,104
Overload in 10 seconds.

471
00:27:22,177 --> 00:27:23,235
Six,

472
00:27:23,612 --> 00:27:24,704
five,

473
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,304
four...

474
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,748
It's gone,

475
00:27:37,825 --> 00:27:39,793
but it's a pretty safe bet
more are on the way.

476
00:27:39,861 --> 00:27:41,795
Yeah, we're not going to
wait around to find out.

477
00:27:57,444 --> 00:27:58,638
Nice work, gentlemen.

478
00:27:58,712 --> 00:28:00,202
You got what you need?

479
00:28:00,447 --> 00:28:01,538
We're good.

480
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:04,375
Let's get this stuff out of here.

481
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,291
You ready to go?

482
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,433
I don't know what I'm gonna say.

483
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:29,305
He doesn't even know I'm his father.
I'm just some guy

484
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:32,768
who shows up every once in a while
to see how he's doing.

485
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,214
And, how is he doing?

486
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,381
His mom is...

487
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:45,449
I think she's a good person.
I just don't think she's a good parent.

488
00:28:45,922 --> 00:28:47,446
Folks from Homeworld Command tell me

489
00:28:47,523 --> 00:28:49,650
if I was to make the phone call,
they'll step in,

490
00:28:50,026 --> 00:28:52,221
see he's raised in a proper home.

491
00:28:53,895 --> 00:28:57,764
Well, I wouldn't make any rash decisions.

492
00:28:58,801 --> 00:29:01,167
What about you?
What are you gonna say to Sharon?

493
00:29:01,804 --> 00:29:06,172
Oh, I just got back, and I didn't see her.

494
00:29:06,241 --> 00:29:08,471
She's at a conference in Brussels.

495
00:29:09,711 --> 00:29:10,735
Not enough time.

496
00:29:10,812 --> 00:29:12,006
Sorry.

497
00:29:14,682 --> 00:29:16,912
You know,

498
00:29:17,218 --> 00:29:19,914
you go back billions of light-years,

499
00:29:21,455 --> 00:29:23,355
cross an entire universe,

500
00:29:23,424 --> 00:29:27,052
and you're just separated
by a couple of thousand miles.

501
00:29:28,962 --> 00:29:32,363
Anyway, I got to talk to her on the phone.

502
00:29:34,767 --> 00:29:36,360
What'd you say?

503
00:29:40,473 --> 00:29:43,442
I said I was sorry.

504
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:49,775
That this wasn't fair to her anymore,

505
00:29:49,848 --> 00:29:52,043
and she should just move on.

506
00:29:54,819 --> 00:29:56,548
What did she say?

507
00:29:58,156 --> 00:29:59,589
Not much.

508
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:01,118
She...

509
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,984
She just started crying.

510
00:31:26,637 --> 00:31:28,764
Eat up, everybody.
Except for the canned goods,

511
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:30,330
this is all going to waste anyway.

512
00:31:30,408 --> 00:31:33,673
For once, I'm stuffed.
I can't eat another bite.

513
00:31:33,879 --> 00:31:36,279
Mmm. I think I can use
just a little bit more.

514
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,436
Oh, yeah?

515
00:31:38,048 --> 00:31:40,608
All right, Colonel,
how about a toast?

516
00:31:40,951 --> 00:31:42,384
- Really?
- Yes.

517
00:31:42,453 --> 00:31:44,148
All right. All right, why not?

518
00:31:45,256 --> 00:31:50,887
Well, we've been through
a hell of lot together, that's for sure.

519
00:31:51,561 --> 00:31:54,189
I guess it would be easy to dwell
on everything that we have lost,

520
00:31:54,364 --> 00:31:56,798
but I think today I would rather
think about what we still have, and

521
00:31:57,633 --> 00:31:59,123
maybe what we've gained.

522
00:31:59,601 --> 00:32:01,660
We're a... We're family now,

523
00:32:02,037 --> 00:32:04,028
whether we like it or not.

524
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:07,803
Sons, daughters, sisters.

525
00:32:09,478 --> 00:32:12,811
Even the slightly crazy uncle
who, despite everything,

526
00:32:12,881 --> 00:32:15,247
still manages to
come through for you in the end.

527
00:32:19,053 --> 00:32:20,145
You are

528
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:24,048
the smartest, bravest,
most compassionate people

529
00:32:24,358 --> 00:32:27,452
that I have ever had
the honor to serve with.

530
00:32:28,662 --> 00:32:29,788
To family.

531
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:32,395
- To family.
- To family.

532
00:32:43,642 --> 00:32:44,700
Sweet dreams.

533
00:32:56,789 --> 00:32:58,051
You all right?

534
00:32:58,891 --> 00:33:00,187
Yes, sir.

535
00:33:04,929 --> 00:33:07,659
Well, I guess you're finally going to
get some sleep.

536
00:33:07,932 --> 00:33:10,456
Three years. That should be enough.

537
00:33:14,771 --> 00:33:16,966
Lieutenant, go ahead.

538
00:33:17,174 --> 00:33:18,334
Are you sure?

539
00:33:18,408 --> 00:33:20,932
Yeah. Yeah, we're going to be fine.

540
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:04,714
<i>So, Rush and Eli are finishing
up the last of the programming.</i>

541
00:34:04,785 --> 00:34:06,946
They should be done by the time I get back.

542
00:34:07,021 --> 00:34:09,251
- You're not going to go see Emily?
- We're done.

543
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,347
Why re-open old wounds?

544
00:34:11,858 --> 00:34:13,883
- You know, for what it's worth...
- David, listen,

545
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,588
my marriage, that was...

546
00:34:16,662 --> 00:34:18,391
That was broken a long time ago,

547
00:34:18,798 --> 00:34:21,061
and I have no one to blame but myself.

548
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,395
Whatever happens,
we're not giving up on you.

549
00:34:24,202 --> 00:34:26,898
Some of us may have a few more
gray hairs, but we'll still be here.

550
00:34:28,907 --> 00:34:30,772
Good luck, Everett.

551
00:34:31,243 --> 00:34:32,800
Thanks, David.

552
00:34:35,246 --> 00:34:37,578
<i>How could we have missed it?
There was no way of knowing.</i>

553
00:34:37,648 --> 00:34:38,774
But we ran a diagnostic!

554
00:34:38,849 --> 00:34:40,875
And it showed no problems,
because at that stage,

555
00:34:40,986 --> 00:34:43,545
that particular section
had yet to be fully engaged.

556
00:34:43,621 --> 00:34:46,021
- What's going on?
- We repaired the eight pods,

557
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:48,024
but one of them was
more damaged than we thought.

558
00:34:48,092 --> 00:34:52,152
It came online with the rest of them,
but when we ran final checks, it just died.

559
00:34:53,263 --> 00:34:54,787
We might be one short.

560
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,595
Okay, try it now.

561
00:35:01,071 --> 00:35:02,128
It's no use.

562
00:35:02,538 --> 00:35:04,699
Right. Go back down
to the Control Interface Room

563
00:35:04,773 --> 00:35:06,206
and go through the database.

564
00:35:06,275 --> 00:35:09,142
There's over 1,700 pages
devoted to this system.

565
00:35:09,211 --> 00:35:10,803
You'd better get started, then.

566
00:35:16,417 --> 00:35:17,714
Colonel,

567
00:35:20,422 --> 00:35:21,855
we have to talk.

568
00:35:29,163 --> 00:35:30,255
Eli...

569
00:35:30,331 --> 00:35:33,458
Before you ask, the answer is, no.
I haven't found any magical solutions yet.

570
00:35:33,533 --> 00:35:35,330
It's gonna take time.

571
00:35:35,669 --> 00:35:40,572
According to Rush,
if two of us go into the pods now, today,

572
00:35:40,941 --> 00:35:44,535
the one that stays outside could keep
minimal life support going for two weeks

573
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:47,670
before it starts eating into
the power reserved for the jump.

574
00:35:48,214 --> 00:35:49,772
Sounds about right.

575
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:51,908
Well, he's...
He's volunteered to be the one.

576
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:54,643
You're kidding me.

577
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,979
- Really?
- Yeah.

578
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:00,548
He says he's most qualified to figure out
what's wrong with the pod and then fix it.

579
00:36:00,626 --> 00:36:01,888
I don't know about that.

580
00:36:02,294 --> 00:36:06,491
Yeah, and I don't think I can let him do it.
You know, I think it's...

581
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:08,191
It's gonna be me.

582
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:11,199
You're going to fix the pod?

583
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:13,635
I'm obviously not going
to fix the pod, Eli.

584
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:15,465
Then you're talking about suicide.

585
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:16,631
I can't trust him.

586
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:19,301
I can't be sure he's going to
do the right thing when the time comes.

587
00:36:19,376 --> 00:36:21,401
I'll admit he's not perfect,
but I don't think that...

588
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,911
And what if he doesn't find a solution?

589
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:27,143
What if after two weeks, he loses his nerve,
and then he keeps the life support going,

590
00:36:27,216 --> 00:36:28,877
even for just a few days, what happens?

591
00:36:29,886 --> 00:36:33,378
Then we drop out early and drift.

592
00:36:33,456 --> 00:36:35,447
And wake up in 1,000 years.

593
00:36:35,691 --> 00:36:37,659
- If we wake up at all.
- Right.

594
00:36:38,961 --> 00:36:40,087
It's the only choice.

595
00:36:42,932 --> 00:36:44,263
No, it's not.

596
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,330
I'll do it.

597
00:36:50,238 --> 00:36:53,105
- Eli...
- If you stay out, it's automatic.

598
00:36:53,341 --> 00:36:54,672
You're dead.

599
00:36:54,743 --> 00:36:58,178
If I do it, at least I have a chance.
Maybe even a better chance than Rush.

600
00:36:58,612 --> 00:37:02,810
For too long,
I've been content to stay in his shadow,

601
00:37:02,883 --> 00:37:06,909
play the part of the eager young protégé,
take his orders, but...

602
00:37:09,189 --> 00:37:11,020
I'm not afraid to say it anymore.

603
00:37:11,758 --> 00:37:13,192
I'm smarter than him.

604
00:37:14,795 --> 00:37:16,523
And all three of us know it.

605
00:37:16,796 --> 00:37:18,730
I can't ask you to do that.

606
00:37:18,798 --> 00:37:21,323
And I can't take no for an answer.

607
00:37:24,137 --> 00:37:25,399
Sorry.

608
00:37:36,981 --> 00:37:38,243
Hey.

609
00:37:40,151 --> 00:37:41,812
He told me about the conversation.

610
00:37:42,587 --> 00:37:44,817
Oh. Right.

611
00:37:45,423 --> 00:37:47,652
- Awkward.
- No, not really.

612
00:37:48,525 --> 00:37:50,516
I knew he wouldn't
trust me enough to let me stay.

613
00:37:51,495 --> 00:37:53,360
- You did?
- Well, in case you hadn't noticed,

614
00:37:53,431 --> 00:37:54,625
we do have history.

615
00:37:54,699 --> 00:37:56,394
Is that why you volunteered
in the first place?

616
00:37:56,666 --> 00:37:57,963
Because you knew he wouldn't accept?

617
00:37:59,002 --> 00:38:00,435
What difference does it make?

618
00:38:03,106 --> 00:38:04,164
No.

619
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:11,346
The only thing I failed to anticipate was
that you would volunteer to take my place.

620
00:38:12,181 --> 00:38:14,081
So, you did want it to be Young.

621
00:38:14,183 --> 00:38:18,209
I don't want anyone to die, Eli.
This isn't even my idea, remember?

622
00:38:18,286 --> 00:38:20,015
But you didn't come up with a better one.

623
00:38:20,555 --> 00:38:22,614
Not in the allotted time, no.

624
00:38:23,524 --> 00:38:26,357
Which just goes to prove my point.
We're going to need you on the other side.

625
00:38:26,995 --> 00:38:28,325
Oh,

626
00:38:28,662 --> 00:38:29,755
I'll be there.

627
00:38:30,398 --> 00:38:35,165
You know, maybe I haven't said this
often enough, Eli, but you do have...

628
00:38:37,904 --> 00:38:40,202
You do have tremendous potential.

629
00:38:40,507 --> 00:38:42,498
I'd hate to see you throw it all away.

630
00:38:42,576 --> 00:38:43,668
I'm not.

631
00:38:45,846 --> 00:38:48,370
Anyway, what's the point
of having potential

632
00:38:48,447 --> 00:38:50,472
if you're not going to step up
when you're really needed?

633
00:38:54,887 --> 00:38:59,118
You've come a long way from that
video-game slacker I discovered a year ago.

634
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,384
Thanks.

635
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:02,320
You've been pretty consistent.

636
00:39:21,345 --> 00:39:22,607
Colonel.

637
00:39:24,248 --> 00:39:25,681
Mr. Wallace.

638
00:39:46,803 --> 00:39:48,703
You're sure about this, right?

639
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:53,604
I've never been
more sure of anything in my life.

640
00:40:04,452 --> 00:40:05,510
You're a good man, Eli.

641
00:40:05,586 --> 00:40:08,521
Now, get this done,
and we'll see you on the other side.

642
00:40:08,889 --> 00:40:10,480
- Right.
- Right.

643
00:43:27,139 --> 00:43:28,128
English - US - SDH
