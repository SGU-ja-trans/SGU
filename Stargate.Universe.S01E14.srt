00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,113
RUSH: This is what Destiny intended from
the moment it entered the star system.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,395
YOUNG: We are going to survive.
We are going to make it home.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,835
I'm telling you,
the ship came here for a reason!

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,235
RUSH: This ship is powered
by the stars themselves.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,510
WRAY: He and Young are
bumping heads, yes.

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,795
Not sure which camp is the better choice.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,632
YOUNG: We just pretend
nothing happened?

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,393
We need to be ready
for the next encounter.

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,993
For the sake of the crew.

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,713
For the sake of the crew.

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,309
I want to see the alien ship.

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,356
ELI: Were you just trying to distract me?

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,715
So that I wouldn't notice
what Rush was doing?

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,360
Look, I knew it was coming,
but I didn't know when.

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,512
Navigation, propulsion, and many
others have been locked out entirely

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,717
by a master code,
which we have had no luck in breaking.

17
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,031
YOUNG: An Ancient device like this
is pretty much a death sentence.

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,908
I'm not stopping you, Rush.
Go, sit, be my guest.

19
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,552
Have you seen my glasses?

20
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,033
Bread box.

21
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,508
- You're up early.
- Am I?

22
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,512
- I thought you'd sleep in.
- I've got things to do.

23
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,712
- 4:00?
- What?

24
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,078
Dr. Browning.

25
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,959
Oh, yeah, that's today, right.

26
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,557
Listen, I won't be able to make it today.

27
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,197
- Nicholas...
- Nothing to worry about.

28
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,869
Okay, who can tell me the significance
of Shor's algorithm?

29
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,232
BOY: It's a quantum algorithm
used for integer factorization.

30
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,232
It's important because it can,
in theory, be used to

31
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,108
"break" the widely used public-key
cryptography scheme known as RSA.

32
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,915
RSA is based on the assumption
that factoring large numbers

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,514
is computationally infeasible.

34
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,989
This assumption is valid
for classical computers.

35
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,198
No classical algorithm is known
that can factor in polynomial time.

36
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,999
Professor Rush?

37
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,351
Yeah. Very good.

38
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,113
CONSTANCE: Nicholas!

39
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,394
Nicholas? What are you doing here?

40
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,799
I'm sorry, Constance, not now.

41
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,871
I thought you were taking Gloria
to the oncologist today.

42
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,029
She wanted to go by herself.

43
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,156
That doesn't sound like her.
Are you sure she really meant it?

44
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,958
Oh, yes, quite sure.

45
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,996
Nick, what's wrong with you?
I thought you'd be worried sick.

46
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,752
I am. Very concerned.

47
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,275
Yes?

48
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,594
It's back.

49
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,869
I had a feeling.

50
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,872
You did? You never said so.

51
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,669
No.

52
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,754
I can't go through this again. I can't.

53
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,792
Nick? Nick, are you there?

54
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,029
Yes, yes.

55
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,875
Are you coming home?

56
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,589
Nick?

57
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,833
Yes, soon, soon.

58
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09,235
Professor Rush? Professor Rush.
Hi, I'm Dr. Daniel Jackson.

59
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,118
- So you are.
- I'm sorry to accost you here.

60
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,395
I dropped by your office, they told me
you hadn't come in for the day.

61
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,469
Do you know
I really don't have time for this?

62
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,471
Actually, I think you're going to
want to hear what I have to say.

63
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,913
Is there some place
more private we could talk?

64
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,594
You're going to tell me
about the stargate program.

65
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,758
Your current dilemma. How to unlock
the stargate's ninth and final chevron.

66
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,276
Specifically, how much energy
will be required.

67
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,114
How do you know that?
Those details are highly classified.

68
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:38,069
The project hasn't even been named yet,
has it? How about "Icarus"?

69
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,872
I know because it's already happened

70
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,397
and you're just a figment
of my imagination.

71
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,870
Reliving all of this is just a necessary evil,

72
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,077
an unfortunate side effect
to a process I can't control.

73
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,436
And it keeps getting in the bloody way
of what I need to do.

74
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,195
You, the University, the clouds in the sky,

75
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,714
all just a dream, a distant memory,

76
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,670
and one I'd really rather went away.

77
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,191
YOUNG: What the hell's going on?

78
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,472
His pulse is strong.
BP's elevated, but not dramatically.

79
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,073
He didn't want to involve anyone else.

80
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,879
I am in command of this ship,
and that means

81
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,918
you don't do anything without
involving me. Do you understand?

82
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,599
What is all this?

83
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,591
We modified the interface.

84
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,159
We were hoping it would allow us
to use the chair

85
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,434
without causing damage to the subject...

86
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,509
And?

87
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,952
Rush is the first subject.

88
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,270
- Let's wake him up.
- I can't.

89
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,317
Severing the connection externally
could be very dangerous.

90
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,152
He has to do it himself.

91
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,753
Look, with or without me,
Rush still would've done it.

92
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,831
JOHANSEN:
Even after what happened to Franklin?

93
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,388
BRODY: This is the only way
to unlock control of the ship.

94
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,072
The code has to be
in the databank somewhere.

95
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,639
YOUNG: Let's forget
about Rush for a second.

96
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,392
If he wants to kill himself, so be it.

97
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,038
How do you know
this modification you've made

98
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,032
is not going to backfire,
put the whole ship in jeopardy?

99
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,670
- I don't.
- How does this new interface work?

100
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,236
We created a buffer to slow down
the transfer of information.

101
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,518
We also limited the connection to a narrow
range of the subject's subconscious.

102
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,673
That should protect
the vast majority of his brain.

103
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,070
In a worst case, we hope only the
memories that we targeted could be lost.

104
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,799
And if it works,
the data stored in the ship's computer

105
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,348
should be made available to Rush
through a dream.

106
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,550
- A dream?
- A semi-lucid one.

107
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,757
Sort of a stimulated recall
of the memories in question.

108
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,149
- How does he wake up?
- There's a built-in trigger.

109
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,397
It should appear to him
as a distinctive door.

110
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,040
All he has to do is open it
and walk through.

111
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,991
He seems stable for now.

112
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,072
Okay, let's say this is working.
Do you have any feedback?

113
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,673
Do you know what Rush is
actually doing in there?

114
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,275
- No.
- Anything goes wrong, I'm pulling the plug.

115
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,791
Get on a plane. Go.

116
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,679
- I don't want to go alone.
- CONSTANCE: I'll go with you.

117
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,032
Thank you.
The truth is, as much as I'd like to, I...

118
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,391
I don't think I have the strength.

119
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,069
Nicholas?

120
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,508
My God, Nick...

121
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,229
Don't worry.
I haven't lost my mind, not yet, anyway,

122
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,151
but as you can see, I am rather busy.

123
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,314
Ignoring it isn't helping anyone.
Burying yourself in work this way...

124
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,550
- She needs you.
- You know, thank you for your concern,

125
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,757
but, you know, I really cannot deal
with any distractions at the moment...

126
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,717
Is that what your dying wife is to you,
a distraction?

127
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,153
No, no, no, of course not.

128
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,835
She wants to go home one last time.
You should take her.

129
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,239
Constance.

130
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,992
I know you mean well, I really do.

131
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,196
But I can't go anywhere, not now.

132
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,189
Hey.

133
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,035
Hey.

134
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,079
Are we okay?

135
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,271
Sure. Why not?

136
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,391
You chose to sit here by yourself
instead of with me.

137
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,674
You looked busy.

138
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,790
I need to know that
we're going to be okay.

139
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,391
I know you think that I betrayed you,
and I'm sorry.

140
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,112
I never meant to hurt you.

141
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,352
It will never happen again.
Your friendship means too much to me.

142
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,232
Never a dull moment.

143
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,277
Shall we see where we are now?

144
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,191
- What do we got?
- Take a look.

145
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,071
CHLOE: Are those buildings?
ELI: Were.

146
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,273
They look like ruins.

147
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,590
It's the first sign of civilization
on a planet out here.

148
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,477
- Human?
- No signs of any life.

149
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,039
We should go check it out.

150
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,468
Six hours on the clock.

151
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,357
- Why don't you guys gear up?
- Yeah.

152
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,911
- I'd like to go.
- Me, too.

153
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,917
Chloe has been studying
all of Dr. Jackson's work.

154
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,194
- Really?
- You have?

155
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,236
- I have.
- Say something archeological.

156
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,151
- Stratification.
- That's good.

157
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,753
- Thank you.
- Plus,

158
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,717
didn't you say you took Ancient History?

159
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,392
- I did.
- At Harvard.

160
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,755
Well, I don't see how that helps us
billions of light years from Earth,

161
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,115
- but I get it.
- I'm pretty sure we've established

162
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,475
that this ship is no safer than any planet.

163
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,278
Kidnapped by aliens, right here.

164
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,796
I don't have a problem with
either of you going. I never said I did.

165
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,557
Just be careful.

166
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,353
Yes, sir.

167
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:27,150
Every code that's ever been cracked,
every cipher

168
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,109
in the last two millennia has been based
on those that came before them.

169
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,433
This code, however, is so old
there may be no known predecessor.

170
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,158
You're talking about a proto-encryption?

171
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,389
Exactly. Right.

172
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,517
Well, how do we attack it
with no basis, then?

173
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,519
None of you?

174
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,875
Nothing? None of you see
any pattern in this?

175
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,190
So, what good are you lot, then?
Why are you here?

176
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,032
There are symbols up there
I've never even seen before.

177
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,669
Yes, you have! Yes, you have,
because I have, and you are all me!

178
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,355
Get out! All of you just get out!

179
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,712
It's not their fault.

180
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,069
Yeah, I know.

181
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,275
I'm the one who can't solve it.

182
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,394
Despite the fact it's right in front of me.

183
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,360
Have you given any thought
to what we talked about?

184
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,839
Oh, yeah.

185
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,400
- I'm going to fail at that, too.
- I'm sorry?

186
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,278
Solving the issues of dialing
the ninth chevron.

187
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,477
I'll devote two and a half years
of my life to that.

188
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,792
Meanwhile, my wife is going
to spend her dying days alone

189
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,429
while I'm off, out,
trying to solve that little problem.

190
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,910
And then some kid, some big child

191
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,358
with no meaningful education is
going to jump in at the last moment

192
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,909
and solve it, just like that.

193
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,592
No sense of ambition.

194
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,039
He spends most of his time
playing ridiculous games,

195
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,634
yet he's the genius I'll never be.

196
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,032
He's the one who should be here now,
seeing what I'm seeing.

197
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,879
Look, obviously
you're not yourself right now.

198
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,876
I do understand
what it is you're going through.

199
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,188
Yeah, I know.

200
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,636
I lost my wife and there was nothing
I could do to save her.

201
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,029
It's a terrible, helpless feeling.

202
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,270
Yeah, my wife's not the answer.

203
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,350
Data does come quicker when I'm with her,

204
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,716
but quicker's not going to help me
if I can't interpret it.

205
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,035
There's patterns I'm just not seeing.

206
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,510
I'm just saying if you need time,
take it, be with her.

207
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,436
That's more important right now.
That's more important than anything.

208
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,273
Yeah, thanks, you've been really helpful.

209
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,239
Your nose is bleeding.

210
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,994
Wow. The Kino really couldn't
do this place justice.

211
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,709
- It's pretty incredible.
- Awesome.

212
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,111
Yeah, it doesn't look like anybody's
been here for a long, long time.

213
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,036
Well, we have about six hours
to figure out what happened.

214
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,473
Let's look around.

215
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,794
YOUNG: Progress?

216
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,315
His nose was bleeding. It's stopped now.

217
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,118
What does that mean?

218
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,350
I don't know exactly,
but it can't be good for him,

219
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,396
the way this thing messes with the brain.

220
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,198
His heart rate and BP
have been fluctuating.

221
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,474
You said he was stable.

222
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,233
I said, "For the moment."
That was over an hour ago.

223
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,992
No way at all to tell
if he's having any success?

224
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,953
No, all I'm able to monitor is the rate
the data's flowing into his mind,

225
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,758
and that's been fluctuating as well.

226
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,990
What are the odds that
yanking him out of there will kill him?

227
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,473
I wouldn't even hazard a guess.

228
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,798
I've spent most of the last 20 years
watching what I ate,

229
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,680
denying myself the things I most loved,

230
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,839
and now,

231
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,956
I could eat anything I want,
and nothing seems appealing.

232
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,955
Yeah.

233
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,911
Why are you here, Nick?

234
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,998
Because this is what happened.

235
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,630
You have work to do. Go and do it.

236
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,951
I am doing it.
It doesn't seem to matter where I am.

237
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,036
You have the chance
to change so many things.

238
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,749
The one thing you can't change
is what's happening to me.

239
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,754
Don't let that hold you back.

240
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,593
When the time comes,
I know you'll be there.

241
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,554
Okay, every time I turn, I see another wall.
So what do you think that means?

242
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,437
What do you got, buddy?

243
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,637
Well, it's pretty cool. Looks like
a network of underground tunnels.

244
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,356
- We should check it out.
- Why?

245
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,912
Don't you want to know
who once lived here?

246
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,513
How does that help us?

247
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,870
Hey, so far Destiny has stopped on planets

248
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,757
that had something on them
that we needed.

249
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,432
I'm not saying it's always
going to be the case, but...

250
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,999
Did you see anything on the Kino?

251
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,113
No, but we...

252
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,590
What could possibly be down there
that we would need?

253
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,598
I don't know.

254
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,114
How about a power source
capable of dialing back to Earth?

255
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,633
- Come on...
- You never know.

256
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,073
These people don't look like
they were that advanced.

257
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,233
Actually, many advanced alien civilizations
found in the Milky Way

258
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,675
and Pegasus Galaxies lived in
what appeared to be

259
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,594
primitive stone architecture that concealed
extremely powerful technology.

260
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,150
I admit that was a big nerd moment,
but it's true, isn't it?

261
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,879
All right, you got the Kino footage.
Let's go.

262
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,837
Yeah, that's the thing.

263
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,273
We don't have the Kino footage.

264
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,749
What do you mean?

265
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,190
- It's a bit of a maze down there...
- You lost it?

266
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,919
No, I took a wrong turn
trying to steer it out.

267
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,639
I just need to take a look
and get my bearings.

268
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,958
The footage could be important.

269
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,599
Mmm. Just... Okay, okay.

270
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,599
All right, I'm going to stay up here
and cover your backs.

271
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,999
What, are you scared?

272
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,518
That was a joke.

273
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,759
I'm sorry, I must have mistakenly thought
we were on that level now.

274
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,431
You know, friends who can kid
each other like that?

275
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,472
- Please don't kill me?
- Come on, Sergeant,

276
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,516
you can take up the rear. We won't go far.

277
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,349
GREER: Yes, sir.

278
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,915
What's his problem?
I didn't think anything scared him.

279
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,832
He's a little claustrophobic.

280
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,273
- I need to sit down.
- Okay.

281
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,432
PRIEST: God is our refuge and strength,

282
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:38,795
a very present help in trouble.
Therefore we shall not fear

283
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,240
though the earth be removed,

284
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,029
though the mountains be carried
into the midst of the sea,

285
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,477
though its waters roar and be troubled,

286
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,950
though the mountains shake
at the swelling thereof.

287
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,798
There is a river,

288
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,436
the streams whereof make glad
the city of God,

289
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,115
the holy habitation of the most high...

290
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,270
- I want you to practice, okay?
- Okay.

291
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,313
God is in the midst of her.

292
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,592
She will not be moved.

293
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,312
God will help her
when the morning dawns.

294
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,756
- GIRL: Thank you.
- Mrs. Rush, thank you.

295
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,197
- What was that?
- Probably wind.

296
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,838
Anyone else think we've seen enough?

297
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,311
Weren't you the one
hoping for dead bodies?

298
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,960
Some evidence of
human skeletal remains, actually,

299
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:17,114
and there don't seem to be any.
Well. Oh, God, get it off!

300
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,034
Get it off! Get off!

301
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,999
Okay, that's it. I am out of here! God...

302
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,198
SCOTT: Good idea. Let's go.

303
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,269
GREER: Stop.

304
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,795
Why?

305
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,677
- Don't move.
- Oh, my God, what? What? What is it?

306
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,709
Run.

307
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,909
I think you got it.

308
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,316
Lieutenant Scott, this is Colonel Young,
do you read?

309
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,837
Lieutenant Scott, Sergeant Greer, come in.

310
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,149
This is Scott, sir.
I'm glad to hear your voice, sir.

311
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,073
We are in a bit of a pickle down here.

312
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,309
What's that?

313
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:26,428
We are trapped in an underground tunnel.
We were exploring the ruins.

314
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:31,036
Sergeant Greer was forced to fire
his weapon. The tunnel collapsed on us.

315
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,478
No one is hurt.

316
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,869
Eli and Chloe are looking
for another way out,

317
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,154
but if they can't find one,

318
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,390
we're going to need help
getting out of here, sir.

319
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,517
Why was Sergeant Greer
forced to use his weapon?

320
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,752
There was a spider, sir.
It was approaching Chloe.

321
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,668
A spider?

322
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,312
It was a sizable spider, sir.

323
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,757
I'll send a team. Young out.

324
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,916
Less than two hours
before we jump into FTL.

325
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,470
This is my fault.
We shouldn't have come down here.

326
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,553
So, the good news is,
we haven't run into any more spiders.

327
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,555
Did you find the Kino?

328
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,949
No, unfortunately,
these tunnels seem to go on forever.

329
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,510
We haven't found any other sort of exit
or access to ground level.

330
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,794
We heard wind howling.

331
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,876
No, no, that's what you said it was.
Me, I'm already having trouble breathing.

332
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,076
- No, there's air down here.
- ELI: My heart rate is very high.

333
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,469
Slightly dizzy. Whoa...

334
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,997
All right, calm down. There's got to be
more than one way in and out of here.

335
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,313
I take it the digging is not going well.

336
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,988
We got C-4.

337
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,913
That's not going to do anything
but make this worse.

338
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,629
Colonel Young just radioed through
the gate. They're sending a rescue team.

339
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,598
Yeah. And what are they going to do?

340
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,752
Lieutenant Scott, it's Lieutenant James,
do you read?

341
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,634
James, we hear you. Where are you?

342
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,117
We just found the tunnel entrance.
Is everyone okay down there?

343
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,516
Yeah, we're fine. Look, how bad is it?

344
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,032
I'm not going to lie to you.
It does not look good.

345
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,870
But we're going to get you out of there.

346
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,837
Okay, let's get to work!

347
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,069
Been to ancient worlds

348
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,238
I've scoured the whole universe

349
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,995
Caught the first train home

350
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,149
To be at her side

351
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,074
No matter where I roam

352
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,837
I will return to my English rose

353
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:53,239
For no bonds can ever keep me from she

354
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,430
Dr. Rush? I'm sorry.

355
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,990
I rang the bell several times.
The door was open.

356
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,069
Yes.

357
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,952
Your nose is bleeding again.

358
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,595
I've got some great news.

359
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,557
Our source inside the Lucian Alliance
has come through.

360
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,916
We've got the location of a planet that
just might suit our power requirements.

361
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,797
Well, that's terrific.

362
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,555
I thought you'd be more excited.

363
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,232
I mean, it's going to take some doing.

364
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,912
There's a mining outpost
being run by a small...

365
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,959
Dr. Jackson, do you understand anything
on that board?

366
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,280
No, not really. Why? Should I?

367
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,874
No. I don't either.

368
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,589
I didn't expect it to just present itself.
I mean, why should it?

369
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,794
It's a code. It's meant to be hidden.

370
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,509
A code for what?

371
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,469
Destiny.

372
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,149
This is all information
stored in her memory banks.

373
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,913
At least, I suspect, a small fraction of it.

374
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,038
All completely meaningless to me
in this form, without context.

375
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,917
And, unfortunately,

376
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,310
I don't think staying here any longer
is going to make it much clearer.

377
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,550
- Are you going somewhere?
- Yup, I'm done.

378
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,439
How's your wife doing?

379
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,039
She's dying.

380
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,238
Today, actually.

381
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,272
I really am sorry.

382
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,993
Yeah, so am I.

383
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,998
Shouldn't you be with her?

384
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,678
You keep saying that.

385
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,113
Yeah, well, it's true, isn't it?

386
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,159
What's the date today?

387
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,673
You say your wife is going to die today,

388
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,832
- but you don't remember what day it is?
- No, please, please, just tell me.

389
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,955
April 6th.

390
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,115
April 6th.

391
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,072
She's taken a turn for the worse.
The doctors say the situation's very grave.

392
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:06,039
They don't think she's going to make it
through the day. Thank you.

393
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,308
April 6th.

394
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,671
- What does that mean?
- I don't know,

395
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,913
but Gloria didn't die on April 6th.

396
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,199
Well, it's not the ultimate answer
to life, the universe and everything.

397
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,679
That's 42.

398
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,194
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

399
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,874
Yes, thank you, you've been very helpful.

400
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:52,639
The address of this house is number 4,
not 46.

401
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,038
Why does it say 46 on the door?

402
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,991
Well, 46 divided by two is 23.
I'm sure you've heard of the 23 enigma.

403
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,755
Yeah, it refers to some ridiculous notion

404
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,990
that everything and anything is connected
to the number 23.

405
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,230
Most rational people acknowledge
the enigma is merely evidence

406
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,710
of the mind's power to perceive truth
in almost anything.

407
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,270
Yeah, if you look for it,
you're going to find it.

408
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,198
So, what is this?

409
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,595
Is this my mind playing tricks?

410
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,594
Am I seeing something that's not there?

411
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,313
Convincing myself this is somehow
significant? Significant...

412
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,119
JACKSON: Dr. Rush?

413
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,990
Lieutenant James, this is Colonel Young,
come in.

414
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,669
I wish I had better news for you, sir.

415
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,992
We're doing the best we can,
but things are pretty slow-moving.

416
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,158
YOUNG: You're running out of time.
JAMES: Yes, sir, we know.

417
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,879
Okay, can I panic now?

418
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,715
We've got less than half an hour.
We're not going to make it.

419
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,588
Seriously, what are we going to do?

420
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,555
Sir, he just suffered
some sort of cardiac event.

421
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,553
He seems somewhat stabilized, but I don't
know how much more of this he can take.

422
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,074
Leaving him in there is going to kill him?

423
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,596
I think so, sir. It's just a matter of time.

424
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,557
And you said pulling him out
could kill him, too.

425
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,235
I know I advised against it, but maybe
it's better to opt for risk over certainty.

426
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,231
Unfortunately, things are not going well
on the planet.

427
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,117
Looks like we're not going to have
enough time to dig them out.

428
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,589
However, if Rush can find the master code,

429
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,116
we may be able to stall
Destiny's jump into FTL.

430
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,111
We risk sacrificing Rush.

431
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,475
According to you, he's choosing to stay
connected to that chair.

432
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,199
He may not be aware of the danger
that he's in.

433
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:59,398
If we jump to FTL, Eli, Scott, Greer,
and Chloe are going to be left behind,

434
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,718
so right now,
looks like their best chance is Rush.

435
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,555
Hey.

436
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,435
We couldn't find any other access.

437
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,639
Maybe it's time we made one.

438
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,117
JAMES:
Lieutenant, we're running out of time.

439
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,315
Yeah, we know.

440
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:29,313
We're going to use C-4 to try
and blow a hole in the top of the tunnel.

441
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,470
How far back do you estimate you are
from the collapsed opening?

442
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,597
Not far. About 10 meters.

443
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,274
Move as far back as you can,
and let me know when you're clear.

444
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,238
Copy that. Let's go, guys.

445
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,752
- Good?
- We'll see.

446
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,871
- We're ready up here.
- Hopefully, we're clear down here.

447
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,873
Fire in the hole!

448
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,152
JAMES: Lieutenant, do you read?

449
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,793
Yeah, we're still here.

450
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,877
Doesn't look like
that had the desired effect.

451
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,670
No, sir. We just made things a lot worse.

452
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,349
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's not your fault, LT.

453
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,479
You did the best you could.
No, get your team back to the ship.

454
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,315
- Sir, we still have time...
- Not much.

455
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,270
That was an order, Lieutenant. Go.

456
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,673
You're not here for me.

457
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,636
I've already been through this.

458
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,198
No, you haven't. Not really.

459
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,479
I was here.

460
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,190
You can't lie to yourself.

461
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:38,113
You chose this memory because
it's one you'd rather just forget.

462
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,557
What you need is here now.
That's why you're here.

463
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,359
It's not for me.

464
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,676
You just want your answer.

465
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,912
I need an answer.

466
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,272
You're dying.

467
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,960
- I know.
- You'd rather die than fail?

468
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,829
What have you become, Nicholas?

469
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,992
The things you've done,

470
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,074
that's not who you are. It's not you.

471
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,350
I always had it in me

472
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,800
to make the hard decisions.

473
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,158
I have reasons.

474
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,588
- Good reasons.
- To hurt people?

475
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,279
Are you sure?

476
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,628
You tell yourself
my death gave you courage.

477
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,150
In truth, it made you callous.

478
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,916
You're not the man I loved.

479
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,318
He died with you.

480
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:02,196
I was never your conscience, Nicholas.
You still have one of your own.

481
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,396
You just need to listen to it.

482
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:11,435
Some people live their whole lives
and never find what we had.

483
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:18,355
Don't let what happened to me change
you this way. It's nobody's fault.

484
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,274
I know...

485
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,793
I know that.

486
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,478
It's one stupid gene.

487
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,759
Passed on to me by my mother,

488
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:40,915
incapable of performing its one simple
function, to repair damaged D.N.A..

489
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,717
That's it, isn't it? That's why you're here.

490
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,554
RUSH: Of course.

491
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,349
Go.

492
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,311
I know how much you loved me.

493
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,991
Stop taking it out on everyone else.

494
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,951
I haven't forgotten you, Gloria,

495
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,152
and I never will.

496
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,794
Dr. Rush?

497
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,075
YOUNG: Now, listen to me.

498
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,152
We got five minutes to stop this ship
from jumping into FTL.

499
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,549
- What?
- People's lives are depending on it.

500
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,200
I can't... I can't do that.

501
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,354
I can't do that.
I can't do anything about that.

502
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,993
YOUNG: Lieutenant Scott,
can you hear me?

503
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,312
- Yes, sir.
- We can't stop it.

504
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,798
Understood, sir.

505
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,871
God be with you, Colonel.

506
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,519
All of you.

507
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,114
It's not over, son. Don't give up.

508
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,078
They just jumped.

509
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,434
What are you doing out of the infirmary?

510
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,669
I got work to do, Colonel.

511
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,034
YOUNG: How about solving the access code

512
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,509
that's going to allow us
to turn this ship around?

513
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,031
Well, funnily enough...

514
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,913
I thought you didn't find anything.

515
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,479
RUSH: I didn't say that.

516
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,279
I said I couldn't stop the ship
then and there.

517
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,112
And even though it nearly killed me,

518
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,398
I managed to find a clue which may give us
control of this ship once and for all.

519
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,996
- A clue?
- BRODY: 46.

520
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,877
Well, that seems a little too simple.

521
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,236
It's the number of chromosomes
in human D.N.A.. Genetic code.

522
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,673
This helps us how?

523
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,910
Well, we know in other cases
with their later technologies,

524
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,470
that the Ancients used sensors
that restricted access

525
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,755
by detecting specific genetic markers.

526
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:41,355
The access code to the Destiny is not
like that. It's definitely numerological.

527
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,079
The problem we've had cracking it
is that we had no basis, nowhere to start.

528
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,469
We were just taking wild shots in the dark.

529
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,790
- And now?
- Now we know where to start.

530
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,031
They used their own genetic code,
likely a specific one.

531
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,951
More evolved than ours, no doubt,

532
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,076
but all we have to do now
is run through the variations.

533
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,230
We're still talking about
billions of possibilities here.

534
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,716
I've written a program which is going
to go through the permutations.

535
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,639
- So how long is this going to take?
- Several days.

536
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,711
- Really?
- Or several years...

537
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,597
You know, I was trying to be
a little bit more optimistic.

538
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,477
That's a little different for you.

539
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,794
Rush, all this, this was worth
risking your life for?

540
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,473
We'll see.
