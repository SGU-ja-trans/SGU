1
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:04,298
Just FYl, he's right about
the whole human body and water...

2
00:03:04,437 --> 00:03:06,769
-Eli!
-Walk, don't...

3
00:03:11,578 --> 00:03:15,105
Oh. Look. More sand.

4
00:03:17,317 --> 00:03:18,978
FRANKLlN: This is pointless.
We should go back.

5
00:03:19,119 --> 00:03:20,313
PALMER: We just got here.

6
00:03:20,754 --> 00:03:23,814
l still think we should be checking out
the other planets in range of the ship.

7
00:03:23,957 --> 00:03:27,791
RUSH: l still think you're wrong.
The solution's here.

8
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:37,497
(SlGHS )

9
00:03:55,822 --> 00:03:58,450
ELl: l know. lt was a mirage,

10
00:03:58,558 --> 00:04:02,187
but when we were
walking over that last dune,

11
00:04:03,897 --> 00:04:06,525
l thought l saw the Statue of Liberty
sticking half out of the sand.

12
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,429
Just for a second there.

13
00:04:08,535 --> 00:04:12,596
l was all ready to yell, ''Damn you!

14
00:04:13,807 --> 00:04:16,435
''Damn you all to hell! ''

15
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,814
Oh, come on. That was funny.

16
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:24,177
Was it?

17
00:04:25,552 --> 00:04:27,918
Because it would mean
we were really on Earth,

18
00:04:28,021 --> 00:04:31,115
but in the future,
and the apes had taken over

19
00:04:31,224 --> 00:04:32,919
and then buried the Statue of Liberty
for some reason.

20
00:04:33,026 --> 00:04:34,755
Eli? Have a drink.

21
00:04:34,861 --> 00:04:37,830
Greer, hold up! Hold up!

22
00:04:41,334 --> 00:04:43,165
-This isn't going to work.
-GREER: Not if we keep stopping.

23
00:04:43,303 --> 00:04:45,601
l'm saying we need to split up.

24
00:04:45,705 --> 00:04:46,967
Fine with me.

25
00:04:47,073 --> 00:04:48,768
l agree. Franklin, you should come with me.

26
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,536
Nah. No, no, no, you're with me and Greer.

27
00:04:52,245 --> 00:04:56,272
Sun's been moving that way,
we'll call it west.

28
00:04:57,751 --> 00:05:02,620
Eli, Franklin, Palmer, and Curtis,
you head that way.

29
00:05:02,722 --> 00:05:04,212
We'll test every 20 minutes or so.

30
00:05:04,324 --> 00:05:06,224
After two hours, you head southeast.

31
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:07,986
That should take you back
in the direction of the gate.

32
00:05:08,094 --> 00:05:10,062
Whoa, wait a second.

33
00:05:10,196 --> 00:05:13,222
(CHUCKLES ) Do we really think
that splitting up is the best idea?

34
00:05:13,366 --> 00:05:15,061
l say we head straight back.

35
00:05:15,368 --> 00:05:18,531
There's no point in crossing over
the same territory we've just crossed.

36
00:05:18,671 --> 00:05:21,367
Or we could just stick together.

37
00:05:27,047 --> 00:05:30,346
Look, Matt, l'm sorry.

38
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:35,820
l just have this really, really sick feeling

39
00:05:35,922 --> 00:05:39,824
that you're going to go that way,
and we're going to go this way.

40
00:05:39,926 --> 00:05:43,327
Eli, l need someone that l can trust
to lead the second team, okay?

41
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,920
That is you.

42
00:05:45,265 --> 00:05:47,233
Curtis is a good soldier. He's a tough guy.

43
00:05:47,367 --> 00:05:49,164
He's not going to let
anything happen to you.

44
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:51,897
Truth is, l'm slowing you down
and you want to get rid of me.

45
00:05:52,038 --> 00:05:54,563
l'm doing what l think
will best accomplish this mission.

46
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,036
You asked to come.

47
00:05:57,143 --> 00:05:59,941
l'm telling you how you can help me.
Now suck it up.

48
00:06:01,948 --> 00:06:03,347
Yeah. Okay.

49
00:06:05,885 --> 00:06:10,219
Okay, guys, we're going this way.
Move out!

50
00:06:11,758 --> 00:06:14,022
SCOTT: Radio if you find the lake bed,
we'll double back.

51
00:06:14,127 --> 00:06:17,460
ELl: When you see the Statue of Liberty,
you know what to say, right?

52
00:06:17,597 --> 00:06:20,532
Right. Now we can make some time.

53
00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:47,193
She's here? Right now?

54
00:06:47,193 --> 00:06:48,023
She's here? Right now?

55
00:06:48,128 --> 00:06:50,596
-Yes, ma'am, but as l've explained...
-Chloe!

56
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,357
Mrs. Armstrong...

57
00:07:03,676 --> 00:07:07,510
l know l look different and l sound different,

58
00:07:08,615 --> 00:07:10,276
but it's me.

59
00:07:11,885 --> 00:07:15,844
Mom, please. l have something to tell you.

60
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:19,189
Mom... Stop!

61
00:07:21,961 --> 00:07:23,019
(SNlFFLES )

62
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,596
l'm sorry. lt's just...

63
00:07:33,373 --> 00:07:37,002
The thought that
you're actually on some ship

64
00:07:37,143 --> 00:07:39,168
so far away, l can't even imagine.

65
00:07:40,146 --> 00:07:43,013
-Mom...
-Just tell me you're coming home.

66
00:07:45,652 --> 00:07:46,812
l don't know.

67
00:07:48,755 --> 00:07:50,188
Mom, please!

68
00:07:57,263 --> 00:07:59,663
The ship is old and damaged.

69
00:08:00,934 --> 00:08:03,698
We were losing air and somebody had to...

70
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:07,638
He's dead.

71
00:08:08,775 --> 00:08:09,867
He's dead, isn't he?

72
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,471
(SOBBlNG)

73
00:08:29,896 --> 00:08:31,022
MEHTA: Where is everyone?

74
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,427
Able bodies are searching the ship

75
00:08:32,565 --> 00:08:35,500
for anything that might have
CO2 sequestration properties,

76
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:37,331
and the rest are in crew quarters.

77
00:08:45,945 --> 00:08:48,004
Colonel, we were able
to dial out to the planet again.

78
00:08:48,114 --> 00:08:50,446
JOHANSEN: Colonel Young and Chloe
are using the communication stones.

79
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,551
This is Colonel Telford, Dr. Mehta.

80
00:08:53,086 --> 00:08:56,249
Uh... Right. Okay.

81
00:08:57,223 --> 00:08:59,350
Did you make radio contact
with the off-world team?

82
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,785
Yes, nothing to report yet. They've split up.

83
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:05,090
How much time
before the ship jumps back to FTL?

84
00:09:05,231 --> 00:09:07,131
Roughly nine hours.

85
00:09:07,267 --> 00:09:09,462
Dial out every 20 minutes.
Maintain regular contact.

86
00:09:09,602 --> 00:09:11,729
We do have power issues to be aware of.

87
00:09:11,838 --> 00:09:13,362
Dialing the gate is a significant drain

88
00:09:13,473 --> 00:09:15,566
on what seems to be
limited resources at this point.

89
00:09:15,675 --> 00:09:18,405
The away mission is priority one
right now.

90
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:20,568
-Sir?
-l'm fine.

91
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,978
l understand that there are
other stargates in range.

92
00:09:23,116 --> 00:09:24,981
Four other addresses
came up in the system,

93
00:09:25,118 --> 00:09:26,380
but we seem to be locked out from here.

94
00:09:26,486 --> 00:09:27,714
Well, have you tried working around it?

95
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,811
Dr. Rush didn't think that was a good idea.

96
00:09:29,956 --> 00:09:32,481
l think it makes sense to know
what our options are, so do what you can.

97
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,150
There has to be a good reason why
these addresses are being disqualified.

98
00:09:35,295 --> 00:09:37,786
lf l wasn't being clear,
l was giving you an order.

99
00:09:38,164 --> 00:09:41,224
lf there are good reasons,
find out exactly what they are.

100
00:09:41,601 --> 00:09:44,069
-Let's keep moving, l want to see more.
-You should rest.

101
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,262
Lieutenant.

102
00:09:45,371 --> 00:09:47,464
Sir, Colonel Young's body
needs time to recover.

103
00:09:47,607 --> 00:09:48,801
TELFORD: Give me something for the pain.

104
00:09:48,941 --> 00:09:51,171
The body feels pain for a reason.
l would rather not mask it.

105
00:09:51,311 --> 00:09:54,974
Just do it, Lieutenant. From the sound
of things, you need my help here.

106
00:10:03,323 --> 00:10:05,257
All right, come on. Let's go.

107
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,952
You better save some of that.

108
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:13,328
-We need to slow down.
-We need to cover more ground.

109
00:10:13,466 --> 00:10:15,991
RUSH: lt's going to be impossible
to maintain this pace on the way back.

110
00:10:16,135 --> 00:10:17,193
GREER: Maybe for you.

111
00:10:18,504 --> 00:10:21,769
How tedious. Little boys playing soldier.

112
00:10:21,874 --> 00:10:23,774
Well, l'm sorry.
l've no interest in playing your game.

113
00:10:23,876 --> 00:10:24,968
l'm not playing anything,

114
00:10:25,078 --> 00:10:26,807
l'm trying to save the lives
of everyone aboard that ship.

115
00:10:26,913 --> 00:10:28,938
lf we continue this pace,
we're going to die out here.

116
00:10:29,048 --> 00:10:30,879
Yeah, maybe we will.

117
00:10:32,352 --> 00:10:37,949
Light years away from the admiring eyes
of your father, or your drill sergeant,

118
00:10:38,057 --> 00:10:40,855
or whoever's approval it is
you so desperately seek.

119
00:10:42,362 --> 00:10:43,886
-How dare you!
-Get up and move.

120
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,463
Hey, did you see that?

121
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:48,161
What?

122
00:10:51,704 --> 00:10:53,672
l don't know. Nothing.

123
00:10:54,907 --> 00:10:56,306
Let's move.

124
00:10:59,112 --> 00:11:02,343
One hour.
One hour, and then we start circling back.

125
00:11:02,448 --> 00:11:04,177
All right, fine.

126
00:11:33,413 --> 00:11:35,540
-Just hold that there.
-Thank you.

127
00:11:35,648 --> 00:11:36,945
(GROANS )

128
00:11:42,722 --> 00:11:43,882
What did you...

129
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,514
(BREATHlNG HEAVlLY)

130
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,686
That was supposed to be for the pain.
What did you give to him?

131
00:11:50,797 --> 00:11:53,391
A strong sedative,
which we are desperately short on

132
00:11:53,499 --> 00:11:55,467
and l should not have had to use
just so that Colonel Young

133
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:58,229
can return to a body in working condition.

134
00:11:58,337 --> 00:12:00,430
You are out of line, Lieutenant.

135
00:12:00,573 --> 00:12:03,542
Disregarding the health
of another human being is out of line.

136
00:12:03,643 --> 00:12:06,806
l am well within my rights
as ranking medical officer.

137
00:12:06,946 --> 00:12:08,538
He'll be out an hour or two.

138
00:12:08,915 --> 00:12:10,314
Well, what am l supposed to do?

139
00:12:11,784 --> 00:12:14,753
l don't care.
l have other patients to attend to.

140
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,962
Something wrong?

141
00:12:35,608 --> 00:12:36,836
No, l'm fine.

142
00:12:38,511 --> 00:12:40,138
Good a place as any to stop and test.

143
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,551
-l take it that's not good?
-No.

144
00:12:49,807 --> 00:12:51,741
l don't know. l think that...

145
00:12:51,842 --> 00:12:55,278
Hey, guys. Another negative over here.

146
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,244
l'll radio Scott
and tell him we're moving on.

147
00:12:58,349 --> 00:13:02,115
Uh, yeah, but that's not what's going down.

-lt's not?
-No.

149
00:13:06,257 --> 00:13:08,817

in this thing.

l don't know. l think that...

Hey, guys. Another negative over here.

152
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,474
l'll radio Scott
and tell him we're moving on.

Uh, yeah, but that's not what's going down.

that'll allow us to dial from here...

-Look around. This planet is a dead zone.

-We should've been trying

to dial these other planets from the start.

-Rush said...
-We don't care what Rush said.

159

We don't trust him.

160
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,565
Rush doesn't want us all to die.

161
00:13:21,284 --> 00:13:23,377
-lt's not?
-No.

162
00:13:23,487 --> 00:13:26,047
There are four other viable addresses
in this thing.

163

l think l found an override
that'll allow us to dial from here...

164
00:13:28,925 --> 00:13:32,622
-Yeah, but...
-Look around. This planet is a dead zone.

165
00:13:42,706 --> 00:13:45,266
That doesn't mean we trust him
to make the right decisions.

166

You, too?

167
00:13:48,712 --> 00:13:49,906
What about the lake bed?

168
00:13:50,547 --> 00:13:52,515
lt could be hundreds of miles from here.

169
00:13:52,616 --> 00:13:55,380
We could be blowing our only chance
at finding a decent place to evac.

170
00:13:55,485 --> 00:13:59,512
Maybe the ship did bring us here
because there's lime on this planet.

171

(GREER LAUGHS )

337
00:20:03,976 --> 00:20:06,240
Looks like it's worth a shot to me.

338
00:20:06,979 --> 00:20:08,446
Let's do it.

339
00:20:08,581 --> 00:20:09,980

340
00:20:12,451 --> 00:20:13,475
Stop!

00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:16,110
Look, it's not perfect,
but it's better than here.

342
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:19,088
Vegetation, water, air.
lt's not too late for you to come with us.

343
00:20:19,191 --> 00:20:20,749
-Don't go.
-FRANKLlN: We'll dial back

344
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,158
when we know
it's safe to evacuate everyone.

345
00:20:23,295 --> 00:20:25,388
-ELl: You'll never get back home.
-You don't know that.

346
00:20:25,498 --> 00:20:28,262
Maybe there's a way we can use
the gate system to connect the dots.

347
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:31,768
There has to be a reason
the ship locked out those addresses!

348
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,771
Don't. Please.

00:20:56,195 --> 00:20:57,628
Why did you do that?

355
00:20:57,897 --> 00:20:59,125
He told me to.

-l saved his life.
-By shooting him?

358
00:21:06,739 --> 00:21:07,933
He'll live.

359
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,677
You just stranded Curtis and Palmer.

360
00:21:12,811 --> 00:21:15,678
We'll send them another remote.
l wasn't taking any chances.

361

-Where's Scott?
-RUSH: Still looking for limestone.

We only have six hours
before the ship leaves.

Lieutenant, this is Greer. Come in.

365

Lieutenant! Come in.

367
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,416
You must keep going, my boy.
Don't give up.

368

(CHUCKLES )

370
00:22:37,429 --> 00:22:41,331
l'm not going to let anyone else down
the way l let you down.

371

You really don't have to follow me around
to remind me.

372
00:22:46,472 --> 00:22:50,340
He has his plan for all of us.

373
00:22:58,617 --> 00:23:02,348
He's either out of radio range
or he's lying face-down in the sand,

374
00:23:02,488 --> 00:23:04,353
dead, or soon to be.

375

-l'll go with you.
-No, no, you're just gonna slow me down.

Look, this man has to get back to the ship.
He needs medical attention.

You wait here for me.

and get back here.

a pleasure knowing you.

-Just in case.

l don't even know how to fire this thing.

384
