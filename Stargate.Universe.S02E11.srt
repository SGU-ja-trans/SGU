1
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:08,550
<i>I may be on the verge of discovering
the true nature ofDestiny's mission.</i>

2
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:12,865
<i>You've had control of this ship
the whole time!</i>

3
00:00:13,033 --> 00:00:14,466
Why wouldn't you tell anyone?

4
00:00:14,534 --> 00:00:17,367
The Lucian Alliance is planning
an attack on Earth.

5
00:00:18,038 --> 00:00:21,030
<i>I killed Riley.
I suffocated him with my own hands.</i>

6
00:00:21,108 --> 00:00:23,042
You are a good commander.

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,212
<i>There is no mission other
than getting these people home.</i>

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,408
<i>It was never about going home, it's
about getting us to where we're going.</i>

9
00:00:29,484 --> 00:00:32,282
That is the mission.

10
00:00:32,453 --> 00:00:34,353
That is one hell of a battlefield.

11
00:00:34,422 --> 00:00:36,686
Was a battlefield.
Now it's a graveyard.

12
00:00:36,758 --> 00:00:38,158
<i>It's spreading faster now.</i>

13
00:00:38,227 --> 00:00:40,718
<i>I've tried to fight it,
but it's stronger than me.</i>

14
00:00:40,863 --> 00:00:42,797
Sooner or later, I'm going to stop being me

15
00:00:42,865 --> 00:00:44,298
and become something else.

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,331
There's nothing you can do to stop it.

17
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:49,298
You're telling me you're not the
least bit weirded out flying through this?

18
00:00:49,371 --> 00:00:52,307
Anything that could hurt us
is long dead and gone, brother.

19
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,433
<i>I think I just saw something.</i>

20
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:54,636
<i>What is it?
- I'm not sure.</i>

21
00:00:54,711 --> 00:00:57,305
<i>Colonel, this is Camile.
We're not alone out here.</i>

22
00:00:57,414 --> 00:00:58,881
A ship just dropped out of FTL.

23
00:00:58,982 --> 00:01:00,074
It's a seed ship.

24
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,276
<i>Destiny,
this is Telford.</i>

25
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:03,512
<i>I got a hell of a story to tell you,
and not much time to tell it.</i>

26
00:01:03,787 --> 00:01:05,278
<i>They call themselves the Ursini.</i>

27
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:09,520
Wait a minute, these aliens helped you
out of the goodness of their hearts?

28
00:01:09,593 --> 00:01:10,685
They need our help.

29
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:12,956
They engage their FTL drives
while we're docked,

30
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,019
and we jump with them.

31
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:15,723
<i>That's possible?
Theoretically, yes.</i>

32
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,597
- We've been tricked.
- So much for our deal with the Ursini.

33
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,264
- We just got a message from the seed ship.
What does it say?

34
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,564
<i>"Target the command vessel."</i>

35
00:01:22,641 --> 00:01:25,303
<i>Shields are weakening, and
several weapons platforms are down!</i>

36
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:28,312
- We might want to consider falling back.
- There's nowhere to fall back to.

37
00:01:30,749 --> 00:01:32,081
Step away from that console.

38
00:01:32,151 --> 00:01:33,778
- It's too late.
- What did you do?

39
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,285
Chloe, what did you do?

40
00:01:47,434 --> 00:01:48,628
There's hundreds of these things!

41
00:01:48,702 --> 00:01:50,363
There's no way we're gonna be
able to shoot them all down.

42
00:01:50,437 --> 00:01:51,597
What about the main weapon?

43
00:01:51,672 --> 00:01:54,106
No, that's useless against the drones.
The Command ship's out of range.

44
00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:55,567
It'd just be a waste of power.

45
00:01:58,713 --> 00:02:00,704
Chloe, tell me what you did.

46
00:02:02,383 --> 00:02:04,317
- I sent a signal.
- To who?

47
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,345
No! No, no, no, no, easy, easy!
Stand down!

48
00:02:10,325 --> 00:02:11,384
Don't move.

49
00:02:12,228 --> 00:02:14,162
Wait, wait, wait! Just wait, wait!

50
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:15,788
Chloe...

51
00:02:16,565 --> 00:02:20,968
Look, the aliens who took me,
they followed us to this galaxy.

52
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,131
They've been looking for us ever since.

53
00:02:23,606 --> 00:02:25,598
Now they know where we are.

54
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:50,433
Three hyperspace windows just opened.

55
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:52,795
More drones?
- No, they're ships.

56
00:02:53,872 --> 00:02:55,533
It's the aliens from the other galaxy.

57
00:03:02,247 --> 00:03:04,307
They're headed straight for us.

58
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:10,916
She sold us out.

59
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,014
Just hang on.

60
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,227
I told you this might come down
to you and me.

61
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:20,028
I know, but not now, not yet.
I'm still in control.

62
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:22,801
I did it to help us. It's our only chance.

63
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,360
What are you talking about?

64
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,550
Half the drones just veered off.

65
00:03:36,818 --> 00:03:38,718
They're attacking the alien ships.

66
00:03:38,787 --> 00:03:39,913
They don't discriminate.

67
00:03:39,988 --> 00:03:41,819
Anything that's not part
of the cluster is a target.

68
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,357
We might just be able
to hold them off now.

69
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:54,792
Sorry, sorry!
Some of them are still getting through!

70
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,202
<i>Colonel, this is Scott.
We found Chloe.</i>

71
00:03:57,273 --> 00:04:00,266
It looks like she may have given away
our position to the aliens who took her.

72
00:04:00,344 --> 00:04:02,369
Roger that, Lieutenant.
We got them on our screens.

73
00:04:02,713 --> 00:04:06,513
Sir, she says she did it as a diversion,
to give us a chance

74
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:07,572
<i>to get to the Command ship.</i>

75
00:04:07,651 --> 00:04:09,278
I was gonna say it's our chance
to get the hell out of here.

76
00:04:09,353 --> 00:04:11,652
No, we'll never get out of this system,
not without FTL.

77
00:04:11,723 --> 00:04:12,815
Put her in a holding cell

78
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,755
and this time make sure
she doesn't get out.

79
00:04:17,528 --> 00:04:18,552
Yes, sir.

80
00:04:20,031 --> 00:04:21,896
Everett, I hate to say it
but I think Rush is right.

81
00:04:21,966 --> 00:04:23,092
This could be our only chance.

82
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,136
There's a lot of drones
protecting that Command ship.

83
00:04:25,204 --> 00:04:26,831
If we do this, we're gonna take
pretty heavy fire.

84
00:04:26,905 --> 00:04:28,429
Maybe not. I've been thinking.

85
00:04:28,507 --> 00:04:30,202
They all take their orders
from the Command ship, right?

86
00:04:30,276 --> 00:04:32,904
Probably through some sort of
subspace communication.

87
00:04:32,978 --> 00:04:36,709
Well, what if we could jam that signal
even for just a few seconds?

88
00:04:36,782 --> 00:04:38,216
That might give us the time that we need.

89
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:40,108
- Can that work?
- It just might.

90
00:04:40,186 --> 00:04:42,017
Let's plot a course for the Command ship.

91
00:04:42,088 --> 00:04:43,749
Eli, go. I'll help with the weapons.

92
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:45,853
Give me all the speed you can muster.

93
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:02,339
Believe whatever you want, Matt,
but I did this for all of us.

94
00:05:14,556 --> 00:05:16,786
Three-man detail here at all times.

95
00:05:18,328 --> 00:05:19,317
Yes, sir.

96
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,736
We're on course for the Command ship.
We'll be there in two minutes.

97
00:05:29,806 --> 00:05:31,672
How's it coming, Rush?
- Almost there.

98
00:05:33,277 --> 00:05:36,440
We just lost another shield generator.
We've got multiple hull breaches.

99
00:05:36,513 --> 00:05:37,810
Seal off all affected areas.

100
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:39,314
Prep the main weapon.

101
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:46,914
Shields are failing.
If we keep up this acceleration

102
00:05:46,991 --> 00:05:49,687
- we're going to lose hull integrity.
- Now would be a good time, Rush!

103
00:05:49,761 --> 00:05:51,092
I should have just kept my mouth shut.

104
00:05:51,162 --> 00:05:52,186
Patience, Eli.

105
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,158
All right, I've got it.

106
00:06:06,245 --> 00:06:07,712
The drones have stopped firing.
It's working!

107
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,714
- Are we in range?
- Just a few more seconds.

108
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:13,942
- They're gonna re-establish the signal!
Just hold on.

109
00:06:16,156 --> 00:06:17,987
- That's it, we're in range.
- Fire!

110
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,863
- Got them.
- Nice shooting.

111
00:06:30,972 --> 00:06:33,770
There's no sign of activity from the drones.
It looks like they've all gone dormant.

112
00:06:33,841 --> 00:06:35,934
See what you can do
when you apply yourself?

113
00:06:38,213 --> 00:06:40,943
How's it going with those aliens,
Chloe's friends?

114
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,412
Two of the ships
were destroyed in the battle.

115
00:06:42,484 --> 00:06:43,712
The other one's just sitting there.

116
00:06:46,388 --> 00:06:48,185
That's giving off a lot of radiation.

117
00:06:48,257 --> 00:06:50,054
Probably just as damaged as we are.

118
00:06:50,392 --> 00:06:51,826
Well, let's hope so.

119
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,931
That's good. Okay, thank you.

120
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:09,772
- How's it going?
- Could be worse I suppose.

121
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:13,506
A lot of minor injuries,
couple of serious burns,

122
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:15,745
but no fatalities.

123
00:07:17,388 --> 00:07:18,686
What about Baras?

124
00:07:22,727 --> 00:07:25,127
Chloe broke his arm in two places.

125
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:27,726
Did you know she could do
something like that?

126
00:07:29,568 --> 00:07:30,592
No.

127
00:07:32,705 --> 00:07:35,333
All right, the good news is FTL
didn't take any more damage.

128
00:07:35,408 --> 00:07:37,842
In fact, we should have it back
online pretty soon.

129
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:41,673
And the bad news?
- Um, you're looking at it.

130
00:07:41,948 --> 00:07:43,415
It's a shield emitter relay.

131
00:07:43,483 --> 00:07:46,282
There are four more just like it,
completely burned out.

132
00:07:46,353 --> 00:07:48,685
We have to bypass them
before we can restore full coverage,

133
00:07:48,755 --> 00:07:50,279
which we need in order to jump.

134
00:07:50,357 --> 00:07:52,348
- How long?
- Couple hours at least.

135
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,757
Keep me posted. Where's Rush?

136
00:07:55,128 --> 00:07:58,121
Last I heard he was heading
to the Control Interface Room.

137
00:08:00,835 --> 00:08:02,700
Okay, want to grab a flashlight?

138
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:09,800
Just going over Chloe's handiwork.

139
00:08:10,512 --> 00:08:13,141
You know, she bypassed
the communications panel on the bridge,

140
00:08:13,215 --> 00:08:14,443
and that took some doing.

141
00:08:14,683 --> 00:08:16,514
Well, she claims she did it to help us.

142
00:08:17,686 --> 00:08:19,677
And so it did. This time.

143
00:08:19,855 --> 00:08:23,188
Wait a minute,
I thought you liked the new Chloe.

144
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:25,785
Well, did I ever give the impression
I didn't like the old one?

145
00:08:25,996 --> 00:08:28,362
Just because I took a pragmatic
approach to her situation

146
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:30,763
doesn't mean to say I don't care for her.

147
00:08:31,868 --> 00:08:33,859
If I could have done something to stop it,
I would have.

148
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:36,499
She took out a guard twice her size.

149
00:08:36,806 --> 00:08:39,708
Yeah, and walked through
a lock-down protocol like it wasn't there.

150
00:08:39,944 --> 00:08:45,382
Neither of us may want to admit this,
she's beyond our control.

151
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,577
<i>- Everett, this is David.
- Go ahead.</i>

152
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:50,846
<i>I've been in contact
with the Ursini on the seed ship.</i>

153
00:08:50,922 --> 00:08:52,083
<i>We've got a problem.</i>

154
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,486
What the hell were they thinking?

155
00:08:56,228 --> 00:08:57,252
They didn't trust us.

156
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,490
They thought the second
we were clear of the system,

157
00:08:59,565 --> 00:09:01,590
we'd be on our merry way
and leave them holding the bag.

158
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:04,466
Well, that would have been
the logical thing to do.

159
00:09:06,372 --> 00:09:07,862
It's not our fight.

160
00:09:09,576 --> 00:09:11,009
Well, it is now.

161
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:13,304
With the drones deactivated,

162
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:16,348
the Ursini thought it was safe
to finally contact their colony.

163
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:19,113
The signal that they got back
was in machine language.

164
00:09:19,186 --> 00:09:20,380
It was another Command ship.

165
00:09:20,688 --> 00:09:23,384
The only possible conclusion
is that the colony had been found

166
00:09:23,457 --> 00:09:25,584
by a second cluster and destroyed.

167
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:27,854
So they really are the last of their kind.

168
00:09:30,531 --> 00:09:34,298
More than likely,
but that's not the only problem.

169
00:09:35,503 --> 00:09:38,267
When they sent the signal,
they gave away our position.

170
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,529
Exactly.

171
00:09:41,176 --> 00:09:43,167
More drones are coming.

172
00:09:48,651 --> 00:09:50,175
Could you hold it up, please?

173
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:52,710
Progress, gentlemen?

174
00:09:53,823 --> 00:09:54,812
Flashlight?

175
00:09:55,424 --> 00:09:58,485
Yeah, we've run a bypass
through this section.

176
00:09:58,562 --> 00:10:00,553
- We're about to test it.
- Okay, we're good to go.

177
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,997
Park, you reading me?

178
00:10:05,068 --> 00:10:06,228
Go ahead.

179
00:10:06,303 --> 00:10:09,704
<i>- Let's power up, say 10%.
- Copy. 10%.</i>

180
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:13,844
Okay, here it comes.

181
00:10:18,116 --> 00:10:19,413
So far so good.

182
00:10:20,518 --> 00:10:21,610
Let's go to 50.

183
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,209
Roger. 50.

184
00:10:30,362 --> 00:10:31,420
Cut it, cut it, cut it!

185
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:44,001
Okay, so it might take
longer than we thought.

186
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:50,838
Flashlight?

187
00:10:53,554 --> 00:10:56,352
Wait. I thought the FTL was fixed.

188
00:10:56,424 --> 00:10:59,188
It is, but without full shield coverage,

189
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,956
we risk tearing the ship apart
the second we jump.

190
00:11:02,063 --> 00:11:03,826
How long till the second cluster gets here?

191
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,834
There's no way to know for sure.
It could be anytime.

192
00:11:08,737 --> 00:11:12,434
I don't suppose there's any chance
of negotiating with these things?

193
00:11:12,507 --> 00:11:13,997
It's an automated weapons system.

194
00:11:14,076 --> 00:11:17,068
The Ursini believe that the civilization
that created them died out a long time ago.

195
00:11:17,145 --> 00:11:19,580
They're machines. One simple directive,

196
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:22,449
"Find alien technology and destroy it."

197
00:11:23,352 --> 00:11:25,081
Reasoning with them is not an option.

198
00:11:25,154 --> 00:11:26,280
What about the Ursini?

199
00:11:27,156 --> 00:11:29,716
We did a tandem jump with them before.
Why can't we do it again?

200
00:11:29,792 --> 00:11:31,522
Well, that doesn't solve our basic problem,

201
00:11:31,595 --> 00:11:32,994
unless they can extend their shields

202
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,794
<i>all the way around the Destiny,
which I doubt.</i>

203
00:11:35,866 --> 00:11:39,597
Even if we trusted them enough to try it,
which I'm guessing we don't,

204
00:11:39,803 --> 00:11:41,600
they blew their FTL
by dropping out so quickly.

205
00:11:41,672 --> 00:11:42,934
That was a one-shot deal for them.

206
00:11:43,006 --> 00:11:46,067
We managed to jam the command signal
temporarily, right?

207
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:48,875
Maybe there's a way
of making it permanent.

208
00:11:48,947 --> 00:11:51,677
Not without a greater understanding
of the technology involved.

209
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,944
Maybe we should get one.

210
00:11:56,554 --> 00:11:57,748
One of the drones, I mean.

211
00:11:58,624 --> 00:12:03,425
Right now those things are totally
harmless, at least theoretically,

212
00:12:03,496 --> 00:12:05,760
and I'm pretty sure
we could fit one of the smaller ones

213
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:07,298
in the back of the shuttle.

214
00:12:07,366 --> 00:12:08,390
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.

215
00:12:08,467 --> 00:12:10,298
You want us to bring
one of those things on the ship?

216
00:12:10,369 --> 00:12:13,237
What I want is to be as far away
from here as possible.

217
00:12:14,241 --> 00:12:16,903
You know, he's right.
It could be very useful.

218
00:12:17,511 --> 00:12:19,206
And very dangerous.

219
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,747
Well, every second we stay here
is dangerous.

220
00:12:21,815 --> 00:12:24,580
This new cluster's going to have
its own Command ship, right?

221
00:12:24,652 --> 00:12:26,210
Yeah, most likely.

222
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,276
All right, so when it shows up,

223
00:12:27,355 --> 00:12:29,915
what happens to the drones
that are already here?

224
00:12:30,358 --> 00:12:32,519
Well, that's just one of those things

225
00:12:32,593 --> 00:12:35,153
we're going to have to try and find out,
isn't it?

226
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,319
Suit up.

227
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:44,829
So, you really think this is a good idea?

228
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:47,707
I think we don't get paid to think.

229
00:12:48,277 --> 00:12:49,266
We get paid?

230
00:12:49,845 --> 00:12:50,903
Hey!

231
00:12:52,415 --> 00:12:55,543
- What are you doing here?
- I guess it's my turn to go for a ride.

232
00:13:00,557 --> 00:13:01,854
Congratulations.

233
00:13:08,566 --> 00:13:11,296
<i>All right, sir, we are all
cross-checked and good to go.</i>

234
00:13:11,502 --> 00:13:13,663
<i>- Lieutenant, be careful.
- Copy that.</i>

235
00:13:13,971 --> 00:13:15,495
Launching shuttle.

236
00:13:24,749 --> 00:13:26,148
Any activity from the drones?

237
00:13:29,421 --> 00:13:30,820
Nothing yet.

238
00:13:32,225 --> 00:13:35,353
We got a big one coming up here,
2:00 high.

239
00:13:44,972 --> 00:13:47,167
No reaction. It looks like Eli was right.

240
00:13:47,841 --> 00:13:48,933
Well, that doesn't mean
I want you spending

241
00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:50,601
any more time out there than necessary.

242
00:13:50,677 --> 00:13:52,235
<i>Let's get this done,
get you back inside.</i>

243
00:13:52,312 --> 00:13:54,473
I've got a candidate.
Two kilometers dead ahead.

244
00:13:57,184 --> 00:13:58,209
Let's go get it.

245
00:14:00,488 --> 00:14:01,978
Open the door.

246
00:14:07,729 --> 00:14:09,128
I'm sorry about this.

247
00:14:13,168 --> 00:14:16,729
After what I did to Corporal Baras,
I can hardly blame them, can I?

248
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:34,322
<i>Just breathe normally.</i>

249
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:37,523
<i>You all right.</i>

250
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:39,357
<i>I'm good.</i>

251
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,294
<i>I'm switching off artificial gravity.
Going to mag boots.</i>

252
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,989
<i>Roger that.</i>

253
00:14:47,138 --> 00:14:48,867
<i>Venting atmosphere.</i>

254
00:14:56,014 --> 00:14:58,312
<i>Keep your eye on those
screens, Sergeant.</i>

255
00:15:01,853 --> 00:15:04,687
<i>I see it. Open the door.</i>

256
00:15:14,968 --> 00:15:18,769
<i>Okay, we need to move
left about a meter.</i>

257
00:15:31,085 --> 00:15:33,919
<i>Okay, now down a little.</i>

258
00:15:47,036 --> 00:15:48,765
<i>Now straight back.</i>

259
00:16:10,694 --> 00:16:12,253
<i>That's it, we got it.</i>

260
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,524
<i>Re-pressurizing.</i>

261
00:16:18,002 --> 00:16:20,732
<i>Now, slowly reinstate
artificial gravity.</i>

262
00:16:27,513 --> 00:16:29,606
<i>- I said slowly.
Sorry.</i>

263
00:16:30,315 --> 00:16:31,373
<i>Is it doing anything?</i>

264
00:16:35,087 --> 00:16:37,851
<i>I don't think so.
I think we're good.</i>

265
00:16:40,627 --> 00:16:42,356
I need your status, Lieutenant.

266
00:16:42,429 --> 00:16:43,657
<i>Sir, we got it onboard.</i>

267
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,790
<i>It doesn't seem to be doing anything,
so I guess we're gonna head back.</i>

268
00:16:46,866 --> 00:16:47,890
Nice work.

269
00:16:49,869 --> 00:16:50,858
Hang on.

270
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,842
We've got movement out there.

271
00:16:56,377 --> 00:16:58,470
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Proximity alert.

272
00:17:00,281 --> 00:17:01,543
Is it a drone?
I don't think so.

273
00:17:01,615 --> 00:17:03,549
Too big. Way too big.

274
00:17:19,135 --> 00:17:20,124
Oh, boy.

275
00:17:24,774 --> 00:17:26,469
<i>Sir, we got a little problem here.</i>

276
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:28,772
<i>That alien ship,
the one that survived the battle,</i>

277
00:17:28,845 --> 00:17:31,040
<i>it just parked itself
right in front of us.</i>

278
00:17:31,114 --> 00:17:32,173
Well, what's it doing?

279
00:17:32,249 --> 00:17:33,716
Right now, it's just sitting there.

280
00:17:38,889 --> 00:17:42,325
I'm gonna try something here.
I'm gonna try backing away real slow.

281
00:17:43,527 --> 00:17:45,120
Are you sure that's a good idea?

282
00:17:45,196 --> 00:17:46,686
Well, we got to get this thing
back to the ship.

283
00:17:46,764 --> 00:17:48,493
Can't stay out here forever.

284
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:52,536
- Wait, we're getting a message.
What's it say?

285
00:17:58,344 --> 00:17:59,470
"No escape."

286
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:05,916
<i>So they're saying that if the shuttle
tries to return to Destiny,</i>

287
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:09,944
or if we make any hostile moves,
they will open fire.

288
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,684
What do they want?
- Our help.

289
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,420
They've intercepted the Ursini's signal.
They know another wave is coming.

290
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:18,928
It's a ploy to keep us here,
force us to help fend off the drones

291
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:21,092
while they get their
hyperdrive back online.

292
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:23,534
But we need the shuttle.
We need to study the drone.

293
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:24,935
I say we call their bluff.

294
00:18:25,006 --> 00:18:26,337
Let them know what's happening.

295
00:18:26,407 --> 00:18:29,433
Agree to help them only on the condition
that they let the shuttle come back.

296
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,808
They'll assume we're lying.
They don't know that we can't jump.

297
00:18:31,879 --> 00:18:33,210
I don't think we give them a choice.

298
00:18:33,281 --> 00:18:36,512
If they're half as badly damaged as we are,
they're not going to want to fight.

299
00:18:36,584 --> 00:18:38,348
They're going to have to trust us.

300
00:18:38,487 --> 00:18:40,853
We're going to have to trust each other.

301
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,955
They've got something we need.

302
00:18:43,025 --> 00:18:45,084
- What are you talking about?
- Chloe.

303
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,286
What about her?

304
00:18:46,361 --> 00:18:49,524
If anyone can undo
what's happening to her, it's them.

305
00:18:49,598 --> 00:18:50,997
They're the ones
who did it to her in the first place.

306
00:18:51,066 --> 00:18:53,331
You want us to send her over there,
with all that's happened?

307
00:18:53,403 --> 00:18:54,631
With everything that she knows
about this ship?

308
00:18:54,704 --> 00:18:56,331
We've exhausted all medical avenues.

309
00:18:56,406 --> 00:18:58,499
We cannot keep her onboard the ship.

310
00:19:01,811 --> 00:19:03,438
This could be our last chance.

311
00:19:04,748 --> 00:19:08,445
The Colonel's not going to force you to go,
but if you don't,

312
00:19:09,987 --> 00:19:14,981
chances are he'll put you off the ship
at the first opportunity.

313
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,023
Doesn't seem like you have much to lose.

314
00:19:18,096 --> 00:19:20,064
You've never been on one of those ships.

315
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:23,030
I'm sorry.

316
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,461
I wish I could have done more to help you.

317
00:19:31,911 --> 00:19:33,936
With all due respect, sir, it sounds crazy.

318
00:19:35,014 --> 00:19:36,572
How do we know they'll do what they say,

319
00:19:36,649 --> 00:19:38,344
how do we even know
they'll give her back?

320
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:41,875
Look, I know this is difficult,
Lieutenant, but we've run out of options.

321
00:19:44,223 --> 00:19:45,816
Yes, sir, if you say so.

322
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:48,354
They're sending a message.

323
00:19:52,766 --> 00:19:54,324
They've agreed to our proposal.

324
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,274
You do realize there's a good chance
this is what they wanted all along.

325
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,479
Everett, listen to me.
I've been trying to contact the Ursini.

326
00:20:12,554 --> 00:20:14,681
They're not responding anymore.
The seed ship's gone dark.

327
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:16,083
So?

328
00:20:16,158 --> 00:20:18,558
So maybe that's something
we should consider.

329
00:20:18,627 --> 00:20:21,221
Power down completely,
everything but minimum life support.

330
00:20:21,297 --> 00:20:22,594
If we have no energy signature,

331
00:20:22,665 --> 00:20:24,326
then we're just another
hunk of metal in the graveyard.

332
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:25,833
But even if we're not giving off EM,

333
00:20:25,902 --> 00:20:28,029
we're still going to stand out
like a sore thumb.

334
00:20:28,104 --> 00:20:29,833
I'm just saying maybe they know
something that we don't.

335
00:20:29,906 --> 00:20:31,066
They have fought these things before.

336
00:20:31,274 --> 00:20:34,175
Yeah, and they...
They got wiped out, didn't they?

337
00:21:03,575 --> 00:21:05,476
You sure you want to bring
this thing inside?

338
00:21:05,545 --> 00:21:07,945
We need to hook it up
to the ship's diagnostic equipment.

339
00:21:08,014 --> 00:21:10,244
- It's the only way.
Is it heavy?

340
00:21:11,084 --> 00:21:12,176
One way to find out.

341
00:21:12,251 --> 00:21:14,185
Why don't you go grab that Kino sled?

342
00:21:14,821 --> 00:21:16,083
All right, thanks.

343
00:21:37,612 --> 00:21:41,048
On three... One, two, three!

344
00:21:45,287 --> 00:21:47,653
Yeah, it's heavy. It's heavy.

345
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,482
Okay, ease it down.

346
00:21:53,763 --> 00:21:55,993
You better be sure about this.

347
00:21:56,499 --> 00:21:58,968
All right, let's move.
Let's get out of here.

348
00:22:03,006 --> 00:22:06,134
I have to say I'm a little surprised
that you of all people

349
00:22:06,209 --> 00:22:08,074
would be the one to suggest this plan.

350
00:22:08,145 --> 00:22:09,635
Why's that, then?

351
00:22:09,713 --> 00:22:12,706
For all we know, they're going to download
every scrap of information

352
00:22:12,784 --> 00:22:15,412
<i>she has about Destiny
the second they get her onboard.</i>

353
00:22:15,486 --> 00:22:17,545
Well, with Chloe back to normal,

354
00:22:17,622 --> 00:22:20,455
the odds of them ever tracking us again
are virtually nil.

355
00:22:20,525 --> 00:22:22,220
Doesn't matter what they discover
about the ship.

356
00:22:22,293 --> 00:22:24,352
Yeah, assuming they honor the deal.

357
00:22:24,429 --> 00:22:25,920
Well, there's no point in keeping her.

358
00:22:25,998 --> 00:22:28,728
If she begins to change again,
we'll soon know, won't we?

359
00:22:28,801 --> 00:22:30,735
Well, still, if I didn't know any better,

360
00:22:30,803 --> 00:22:33,704
it almost looks like you're willing
to put the ship and the mission at risk

361
00:22:33,772 --> 00:22:36,138
for the sake of one individual.

362
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:39,935
Well, that's the problem, isn't it?
You don't know any better.

363
00:23:05,974 --> 00:23:07,305
I'll take her over there, sir.

364
00:23:10,378 --> 00:23:11,367
Colonel...

365
00:23:20,456 --> 00:23:21,650
Good luck.

366
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:30,264
Okay. Now what?

367
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:51,150
Looks like there's a catch here.

368
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:53,520
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You think that's a good idea?

369
00:23:53,591 --> 00:23:56,151
Well, if we can't open
it, we can't study it.

370
00:24:15,882 --> 00:24:17,076
Okay.

371
00:24:17,951 --> 00:24:19,077
Now what?

372
00:24:34,502 --> 00:24:36,766
Looks like they're inviting us in.

373
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:32,497
If you would've asked me
a couple of years ago

374
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:34,465
where I'd be today,

375
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:38,134
this would not have been
one of my guesses.

376
00:25:39,105 --> 00:25:43,064
Chloe, you were right. I let it get to me.

377
00:25:44,577 --> 00:25:46,546
I let it change the way I look at you.

378
00:25:46,613 --> 00:25:48,410
No, it's not your fault.

379
00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:02,123
The time that I have spent on that ship,
I'm not gonna lie, it's been hard.

380
00:26:05,066 --> 00:26:07,660
But some of it has also been amazing

381
00:26:10,004 --> 00:26:12,098
and that is because of you.

382
00:26:12,708 --> 00:26:16,906
If you hadn't been there, I don't
think I would have made it this far.

383
00:26:16,979 --> 00:26:20,312
That's not true.
You're much stronger than that.

384
00:26:20,382 --> 00:26:21,610
You just don't know it.

385
00:26:22,851 --> 00:26:26,811
This is my moment, okay?
Don't contradict me.

386
00:26:46,577 --> 00:26:47,874
I love you.

387
00:26:48,979 --> 00:26:50,446
I love you, too.

388
00:27:20,414 --> 00:27:21,676
Progress?

389
00:27:22,382 --> 00:27:24,942
Well, we've managed to crack
the basic machine code,

390
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,213
but the programming
is incredibly complex.

391
00:27:27,287 --> 00:27:29,881
We're trying to isolate the subroutine
that regulates communication

392
00:27:29,957 --> 00:27:32,620
with the Command ship, but so far no luck.

393
00:27:33,762 --> 00:27:35,059
No, this is excellent work.

394
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,088
Well done.

395
00:27:39,501 --> 00:27:40,593
Thank you.

396
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:44,198
Eli and I will take over from here.
I need you two back on shield duty.

397
00:27:45,174 --> 00:27:47,108
- Kemp and his team...
- Oh, they're very competent I'm sure,

398
00:27:47,176 --> 00:27:49,644
but we're against the clock, and I need
to know my best people are on it.

399
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,580
- Okay.
- A full report in an hour, understood?

400
00:27:53,649 --> 00:27:54,673
You got it.

401
00:27:59,089 --> 00:28:01,990
Wow, that was almost nice.

402
00:28:02,392 --> 00:28:05,384
No, they were just going to get in the way.
Let's get down to some real work.

403
00:28:06,163 --> 00:28:07,187
Ah.

404
00:28:23,114 --> 00:28:25,481
<i>Destiny, this is Scott, come in.</i>

405
00:28:25,884 --> 00:28:28,785
Shoot, I don't know,
maybe you're reading this.

406
00:28:28,854 --> 00:28:32,051
I'm in some kind of hangar bay,
they could be blocking the signal.

407
00:28:32,124 --> 00:28:34,319
The aliens took Chloe.

408
00:28:34,393 --> 00:28:37,658
Jeez, it was only a few minutes ago,
feels like it was hours.

409
00:28:37,729 --> 00:28:40,699
I don't know, I guess there's no way
of knowing how long this is gonna take.

410
00:28:40,767 --> 00:28:42,166
I'm not leaving without her.

411
00:28:43,203 --> 00:28:46,263
I just... I don't know, I...

412
00:28:49,175 --> 00:28:51,075
I just hope she's gonna be okay.

413
00:29:48,239 --> 00:29:50,400
Second Command ship just dropped
out of hyperspace.

414
00:29:50,475 --> 00:29:51,669
Drones are en route.

415
00:29:51,743 --> 00:29:53,335
- ETA?
- Twelve minutes.

416
00:29:54,178 --> 00:29:55,167
Rush, come in.

417
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,341
<i>Second wave just dropped out.
They're on their way.</i>

418
00:29:58,417 --> 00:29:59,816
<i>Have any activity on the drone?</i>

419
00:29:59,985 --> 00:30:02,613
Negative. Are any of the others
from the first group powering up?

420
00:30:03,222 --> 00:30:04,849
- So far, nothing.
- Still dormant.

421
00:30:05,391 --> 00:30:06,551
Well, that answers one question.

422
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:08,286
They're not taking orders from
the new Command ship.

423
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,851
That gives me an idea. Hang on.

424
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,155
<i>Rush, what about the plan?</i>

425
00:30:12,265 --> 00:30:14,426
Can we permanently disrupt
their communications or not?

426
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:16,935
Well, unfortunately, it seems like
there's no way to jam the signal

427
00:30:17,003 --> 00:30:19,631
for any longer than a few
seconds before they adapt.

428
00:30:19,706 --> 00:30:21,799
Not long enough in a battle situation.

429
00:30:22,108 --> 00:30:24,508
<i>- We're pursuing alternatives.
- Such as?</i>

430
00:30:24,878 --> 00:30:26,744
Well, you'll be the first to know.
Rush out.

431
00:30:31,185 --> 00:30:34,279
Lieutenant, how much training
have you had with these systems?

432
00:30:34,355 --> 00:30:36,050
As much as anyone else on the ship, sir.

433
00:30:36,123 --> 00:30:38,649
- Which is?
- About an hour, simulated.

434
00:30:39,261 --> 00:30:42,196
All right, you're going to do fine.
I want you to handle power distribution.

435
00:30:42,264 --> 00:30:44,664
Do not let any of the active emitters
drop below critical,

436
00:30:44,766 --> 00:30:46,996
and stay on top of any sections
that lose atmospheric pressure.

437
00:30:47,469 --> 00:30:49,528
Yes, sir.

438
00:30:49,604 --> 00:30:50,593
Oh, crap.

439
00:30:50,906 --> 00:30:53,398
David, focus your fire on any drones
approaching areas

440
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:54,943
where the shields are still down.

441
00:30:55,011 --> 00:30:56,569
Copy, but they're gonna clue in eventually.

442
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,174
I know.

443
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:35,751
Hey, Chloe? You all right?

444
00:31:36,322 --> 00:31:39,257
You're gonna be okay.
I'm going to get you home.

445
00:31:51,004 --> 00:31:52,995
- There's a lot of targets!
- You've got this, David.

446
00:32:06,587 --> 00:32:07,679
Whoa!

447
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,817
<i>Destiny, this is Scott.</i>

448
00:32:11,259 --> 00:32:13,660
- Lieutenant, what's your status?
- I've got Chloe.

449
00:32:13,962 --> 00:32:17,398
We're on our way back but it seems
that we've got a little problem here.

450
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,024
Yeah, you noticed that, did you?

451
00:32:20,235 --> 00:32:21,702
<i>I'll take out
as many as I can.</i>

452
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:24,034
Negative, Lieutenant, we're not
here to destroy them,

453
00:32:24,106 --> 00:32:25,938
just hang on long enough till we jump.

454
00:32:26,176 --> 00:32:30,203
<i>Just keep clear ofDestiny for now.
They'll focus on the larger target.</i>

455
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,477
No, I've got full shields, you don't.
Don't worry, sir, we'll be okay.

456
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:44,087
They're starting to realize
where we're vulnerable.

457
00:32:44,161 --> 00:32:47,221
I'm taking more and more fire
concentrated on exposed areas.

458
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,994
Rush, whatever you're gonna do,
you got to do it now!

459
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:51,799
I got it. I got it!

460
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:56,671
Look at this.
Recognition software, friend or foe.

461
00:32:57,509 --> 00:33:00,171
Right now the drones that were here first
are ignoring the second wave,

462
00:33:00,245 --> 00:33:02,907
because they don't have a Command ship
telling them which side they're on.

463
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,280
What if we tell them
that they're the enemy?

464
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:08,553
We use the same ID tag
that they used for us.

465
00:33:09,322 --> 00:33:10,812
- Yeah, that could work.
- The only problem is

466
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,290
if we want to upload the new program
to the other drones...

467
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:15,418
We'd have to power this one up first.

468
00:33:27,307 --> 00:33:29,639
- You want to what?
Look, there's no other way.

469
00:33:30,077 --> 00:33:32,342
If that thing starts shooting,
we're not going to be able to stop it.

470
00:33:32,413 --> 00:33:34,005
It will tear us apart from the inside.

471
00:33:34,082 --> 00:33:35,572
I don't think that's gonna happen.

472
00:33:35,984 --> 00:33:37,884
Sergeant Greer,
I need a security team in the lab

473
00:33:37,952 --> 00:33:39,852
where they're working on the drone, now.

474
00:33:40,288 --> 00:33:41,312
<i>Roger that.</i>

475
00:33:41,456 --> 00:33:43,083
We've got a new problem.

476
00:33:43,158 --> 00:33:45,092
The alien ship just jumped to hyperspace.

477
00:33:45,161 --> 00:33:46,150
Good for them.

478
00:33:46,228 --> 00:33:48,856
No, but the drones they were attacking,
they're heading our way.

479
00:33:49,665 --> 00:33:51,292
That's too many.
We can't hold them all off at once.

480
00:33:51,367 --> 00:33:53,062
Rush, how long till that program is ready?

481
00:33:53,135 --> 00:33:54,261
Give us five minutes.

482
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,203
You don't have five minutes.

483
00:34:17,895 --> 00:34:19,886
<i>Destiny, I'm not
sure if you're seeing this</i>

484
00:34:19,964 --> 00:34:22,398
<i>but you've got a whole bunch more
of those drones coming your way.</i>

485
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,625
We're tracking them.
I want you out of there.

486
00:34:24,702 --> 00:34:27,171
<i>- Sir...
- I just gave you a direct order, Lieutenant.</i>

487
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,263
Break off now.

488
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,629
Yes, sir.

489
00:34:35,147 --> 00:34:37,138
- What are you doing here?
- Colonel's orders.

490
00:34:37,482 --> 00:34:39,383
So, what, if we manage
to power up this drone,

491
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:40,612
and it starts opening fire,

492
00:34:40,687 --> 00:34:42,245
do you think there's anything
you can do to stop it?

493
00:34:42,322 --> 00:34:44,085
I'm sure as hell gonna try.

494
00:34:46,492 --> 00:34:47,857
I'm getting damage reports from
all over the ship,

495
00:34:47,927 --> 00:34:49,451
multiple secondary explosions.

496
00:34:49,529 --> 00:34:52,465
Rush, you're out of time. Rush!

497
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,260
Something's happening,
drones are veering off!

498
00:34:55,336 --> 00:34:56,963
Sir, it's the seed ship!

499
00:35:05,045 --> 00:35:07,571
The Ursini are making a run
for the Command ship.

500
00:35:08,516 --> 00:35:10,780
They don't have the firepower
or shields to get through.

501
00:35:10,852 --> 00:35:12,843
I thought they were going to wait it out.

502
00:35:12,921 --> 00:35:14,286
Sir, we're getting a message.

503
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:16,381
Patch it through to me.

504
00:35:24,066 --> 00:35:26,364
It says they're sorry for
getting us into this.

505
00:35:26,435 --> 00:35:27,561
It's a suicide run.

506
00:35:38,582 --> 00:35:39,640
They're gone.

507
00:35:47,225 --> 00:35:50,023
Rush, we've just been given a window
that's gonna close fast.

508
00:35:50,094 --> 00:35:51,561
Activate the damn program.

509
00:36:03,142 --> 00:36:05,269
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold your fire, hold your fire.

510
00:36:11,283 --> 00:36:12,945
Eli, upload the program.

511
00:36:27,735 --> 00:36:30,397
<i>Destiny, this is Scott.
Whatever you guys did, it worked.</i>

512
00:36:30,471 --> 00:36:32,098
These drones are firing on each other.

513
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,901
<i>We should be able to dock now.</i>

514
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,641
Make it quick, Lieutenant.

515
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:40,480
Okay, I'm good. You good? Are we good?

516
00:36:40,549 --> 00:36:42,449
- Yeah, we're good.
- Bridge, this is Brody.

517
00:36:42,517 --> 00:36:44,781
We're ready with our last bypass.
You can power it up.

518
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,378
Let's do it.

519
00:36:56,265 --> 00:36:57,391
Looks like it's holding.

520
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,658
Status?

521
00:36:59,135 --> 00:37:02,969
Shields are now covering the whole ship,
but they're only at 5% power.

522
00:37:03,706 --> 00:37:04,866
We've just taken too many hits.

523
00:37:04,941 --> 00:37:06,034
What's minimum safe?

524
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:08,044
We've never jumped at less than 10%.

525
00:37:09,847 --> 00:37:12,680
Rush, this is Young. We're ready here,
but we have a small problem.

526
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,377
<i>Shields are holding at 5%.</i>

527
00:37:14,451 --> 00:37:16,817
That's not enough.
We're talking about FTL here.

528
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,446
One small weak spot
and the entire ship gets ripped apart.

529
00:37:19,691 --> 00:37:20,783
We don't have a choice.

530
00:37:20,859 --> 00:37:23,259
Even if the program holds,
and there's no guarantee that it will,

531
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,727
the first wave is seriously outnumbered.

532
00:37:24,829 --> 00:37:26,160
They'll be massacred
in a matter of minutes,

533
00:37:26,231 --> 00:37:27,789
and we're right back where we started.

534
00:37:29,067 --> 00:37:30,398
<i>We have to take the risk.</i>

535
00:37:32,805 --> 00:37:35,399
<i>This is Scott.
The shuttle is docked.</i>

536
00:37:36,609 --> 00:37:37,598
Let's go for it.

537
00:37:41,447 --> 00:37:42,846
FTL in three...

538
00:37:46,253 --> 00:37:47,242
two...

539
00:37:56,062 --> 00:37:57,051
one.

540
00:38:26,229 --> 00:38:28,129
Shields seem to be holding.

541
00:38:29,299 --> 00:38:30,960
I think we're going to be okay.

542
00:38:43,747 --> 00:38:46,238
You might want to shut
this thing down now.

543
00:38:46,317 --> 00:38:48,376
Oh, right, yeah. Good idea.

544
00:39:09,108 --> 00:39:10,200
How's the patient?

545
00:39:10,977 --> 00:39:15,346
So far, blood work is normal,
lesions are gone and no more blackouts.

546
00:39:15,548 --> 00:39:17,243
As far as I can tell, she's cured.

547
00:39:17,316 --> 00:39:19,080
I'm glad to hear it, but just in case...

548
00:39:19,152 --> 00:39:22,087
I know. You want to keep me
under observation for a while.

549
00:39:22,856 --> 00:39:24,084
It's okay, I understand.

550
00:39:24,157 --> 00:39:25,818
Well, it's good to have you back.

551
00:39:25,893 --> 00:39:28,657
Hey, I'll come see you
as soon as I can, okay?

552
00:39:28,729 --> 00:39:29,718
Okay.

553
00:39:32,233 --> 00:39:34,224
Hey, how's that
damage report coming?

554
00:39:34,302 --> 00:39:38,363
I'll arrange a briefing when we're ready,
but it's not going to be pretty.

555
00:39:39,541 --> 00:39:40,530
Hey.

556
00:39:41,976 --> 00:39:43,603
You wanted to see me?

557
00:39:43,678 --> 00:39:48,912
Yeah. Matt told me it was your idea
to send me over there.

558
00:39:49,418 --> 00:39:53,479
Yeah. I'm sorry you had to go through that.
There was no other way.

559
00:39:54,657 --> 00:39:59,061
No, I wanted to thank you.
You saved my life.

560
00:40:00,263 --> 00:40:01,252
Again.

561
00:40:01,898 --> 00:40:04,298
Well, you saved all of us.
It was the least I could do.

562
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:07,927
They're never going to give up.
You know that, right?

563
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:10,668
Whatever information they got from me,

564
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,709
it's just going to make them
want the ship even more.

565
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:14,867
Yeah, I know.

566
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,944
Before Matt came in,

567
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:24,444
I was working on some equations,
just to see if I could still do it.

568
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:37,994
They're perfect.

569
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,936
But I'm supposed to be back to normal.

570
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,034
Obviously they haven't
wiped your memory.

571
00:40:44,243 --> 00:40:47,303
You managed to retain
some of the knowledge you gained.

572
00:40:48,314 --> 00:40:50,145
I should think that's a good thing.

573
00:40:51,084 --> 00:40:52,985
Because I can still be useful?

574
00:40:53,053 --> 00:40:55,817
Everyone on this ship is useful,

575
00:40:56,023 --> 00:40:58,992
not just those that are capable
of FTL calculations.

576
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:02,425
- We all belong here.
- You really believe that?

577
00:41:06,134 --> 00:41:07,294
More and more every day.

578
00:41:09,137 --> 00:41:12,595
If Colonel Young
hadn't left me on that planet,

579
00:41:13,808 --> 00:41:17,869
to be found by those aliens,
and if they hadn't taken you,

580
00:41:17,946 --> 00:41:20,381
and you hadn't been put through
that transformation,

581
00:41:20,449 --> 00:41:23,441
well, it's more than likely
we wouldn't have survived this attack.

582
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:26,283
So everything happens for a reason.

583
00:41:28,157 --> 00:41:32,185
Yeah, well, if you'd said that
to me a couple of years ago,

584
00:41:32,262 --> 00:41:36,392
I'd have dismissed it as superstition,
a classic weak-minded response

585
00:41:36,466 --> 00:41:38,434
to the overwhelming complexity
of the universe.

586
00:41:39,169 --> 00:41:40,397
And now?

587
00:41:44,641 --> 00:41:47,702
Well, let's just say you're not the only
one that's gone through some changes.

588
00:41:52,083 --> 00:41:54,051
You should get some rest.

589
00:41:55,453 --> 00:41:56,545
Yeah.

590
00:43:29,487 --> 00:43:30,476
English - US - SDH
