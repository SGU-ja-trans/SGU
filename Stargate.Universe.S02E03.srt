1
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:05,587
<i>This is what Destiny intended from
the moment it entered the star system.</i>

2
00:00:05,699 --> 00:00:08,827
<i>That ship is the best chance
we have of getting home.</i>

3
00:00:09,102 --> 00:00:10,194
Are we done?

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,567
We'll never be done.

5
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:14,168
<i>You shouldn't have left him
on the planet.</i>

6
00:00:14,241 --> 00:00:15,674
<i>You think I don't know that?</i>

7
00:00:16,009 --> 00:00:19,445
<i>Everyone thinks we're safe.
They think that they'll never find us again.</i>

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,677
Why did you take
one of our people prisoner?

9
00:00:23,283 --> 00:00:24,750
<i>We're not safe, are we?</i>

10
00:00:24,818 --> 00:00:26,683
They're coming!
- Who's coming?

11
00:00:26,753 --> 00:00:28,414
<i>Lucian Alliance.
They're coming to take Destiny.</i>

12
00:00:28,488 --> 00:00:30,422
<i>There's only one way
this is going to end if we wait.</i>

13
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,287
<i>I'm not
surrendering this ship.</i>

14
00:00:32,926 --> 00:00:34,052
We need to kill them all.

15
00:00:34,127 --> 00:00:35,594
<i>Everyone except the doctors.</i>

16
00:00:35,662 --> 00:00:36,856
<i>And Lieutenant Johansen.</i>

17
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,091
<i>Remember that planet
that we stopped at?</i>

18
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:40,627
<i>They have my baby.</i>

19
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,828
<i>You have no idea what it's like
to remember things you've done that...</i>

20
00:00:43,904 --> 00:00:44,996
You weren't yourself.

21
00:00:46,207 --> 00:00:47,731
Riley is not going to make it, sir.

22
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:54,873
<i>You found the keys to controlling
all of Destiny's systems.</i>

23
00:00:54,949 --> 00:00:57,611
And you're not going
to tell anyone, are you?

24
00:00:57,852 --> 00:00:59,877
There's an object out there.
What is it?

25
00:00:59,954 --> 00:01:01,945
We're not sure, but we're
about to find out.

26
00:01:02,023 --> 00:01:03,251
We're headed straight for it.

27
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:23,070
Do we know what it is?

28
00:01:23,845 --> 00:01:25,335
Not yet.

29
00:01:26,581 --> 00:01:27,775
Brody.

30
00:01:31,486 --> 00:01:32,680
Colonel.

31
00:01:32,753 --> 00:01:33,981
<i>Ready weapons.</i>

32
00:01:35,523 --> 00:01:37,582
I don't think that'll be necessary.

33
00:01:44,198 --> 00:01:45,392
It's a ship.

34
00:01:45,466 --> 00:01:47,195
<i>It looks like Destiny.</i>

35
00:01:48,402 --> 00:01:50,427
It's got to be of Ancient design.

36
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,003
<i>- Colonel, this is Brody.
- Go ahead.</i>

37
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:57,367
We're not slowing down.
We're on a collision course.

38
00:02:04,385 --> 00:02:05,909
Ready main weapon.

39
00:02:14,163 --> 00:02:15,391
We're going to hit it.

40
00:02:15,464 --> 00:02:19,025
No, no, we're not going to hit it.
We're going to dock with it.

41
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,667
You got any more predictions?

42
00:02:56,104 --> 00:02:59,039
Yeah. I suspect that, very shortly

43
00:02:59,107 --> 00:03:01,905
you'll be assembling a team
to send over there.

44
00:03:31,773 --> 00:03:33,240
How did you know
we were going to dock?

45
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,342
Call it a hunch.

46
00:03:37,312 --> 00:03:42,080
Given the second ship's similarity
in design, our calculated approach,

47
00:03:42,151 --> 00:03:44,016
well, I thought it was
rather obvious, really.

48
00:03:45,255 --> 00:03:47,086
So, what's happening here?

49
00:03:47,857 --> 00:03:50,553
<i>Destiny is exchanging data
with the seed ship.</i>

50
00:03:50,627 --> 00:03:53,357
<i>One of many traveling well ahead
of Destiny,</i>

51
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:56,557
seeding planets with stargates,
gathering information.

52
00:03:56,633 --> 00:03:58,828
This one obviously experienced
some sort of system failure,

53
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:00,334
allowing us to catch up with it.

54
00:04:00,403 --> 00:04:01,734
What kind of data?

55
00:04:01,804 --> 00:04:04,602
Difficult to say at the moment.
It may take a while to translate.

56
00:04:04,874 --> 00:04:06,307
Well, then, you'd better get started.

57
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:07,809
Well, there's plenty of time
for that later.

58
00:04:07,877 --> 00:04:11,938
For now, this is a fantastic opportunity,
and I want to explore it.

59
00:04:12,015 --> 00:04:13,915
No, I'm sure you do, but I need you here.

60
00:04:14,117 --> 00:04:16,210
I need to know what kind of information
we're receiving.

61
00:04:18,955 --> 00:04:20,422
No countdown clock.

62
00:04:21,391 --> 00:04:23,723
<i>Yeah, I figure Destiny's going
to give us as long as it takes.</i>

63
00:04:23,793 --> 00:04:24,885
And how long is that?

64
00:04:24,961 --> 00:04:27,452
Given the amount of data
and the rate of transfer,

65
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,327
I'd guess at least two hours.

66
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:32,027
Okay.
Brody, Volker, you are on the away team.

67
00:04:32,101 --> 00:04:34,228
You have two hours. Make it quick.

68
00:04:36,105 --> 00:04:37,902
With all due respect to Brody and Volker...

69
00:04:37,974 --> 00:04:40,738
They'll be fine. Call it a hunch.

70
00:04:46,249 --> 00:04:47,614
Camile.

71
00:04:50,887 --> 00:04:52,115
I thought you were being debriefed.

72
00:04:52,188 --> 00:04:55,589
Homeworld Command can wait.
What's going on with this seed ship?

73
00:04:56,526 --> 00:04:59,256
Some sort of data
transfer's been initiated.

74
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:02,321
In the meantime, Colonel Young
is sending a team over to investigate.

75
00:05:05,736 --> 00:05:06,964
David...

76
00:05:18,749 --> 00:05:20,444
<i>All right,
Colonel, we are good to go.</i>

77
00:05:20,517 --> 00:05:21,984
Stand by.

78
00:05:31,161 --> 00:05:32,560
Heading in.

79
00:05:38,435 --> 00:05:40,164
Okay, we are at the airlock.

80
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:44,201
<i>Life support is active
over there, so you have a go.</i>

81
00:05:44,641 --> 00:05:45,903
Right.

82
00:06:38,897 --> 00:06:41,365
<i>That ship's older than Destiny
and could be in pretty bad shape.</i>

83
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:43,264
<i>Proceed with caution, Lieutenant.</i>

84
00:06:43,334 --> 00:06:44,596
Yes, sir.

85
00:07:03,822 --> 00:07:05,084
It's incredible.

86
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:11,361
Okay, maybe not as incredible
as checking out a seed ship,

87
00:07:11,429 --> 00:07:14,523
but still, pretty damned incredible.

88
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,691
There's no telling what kind of
information we're getting here.

89
00:07:16,768 --> 00:07:18,497
It could be anything,

90
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:22,097
<i>from Ancient history to details
of the Destiny's mission.</i>

91
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:26,340
- Where are you going?
- The bathroom. Is that all right?

92
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,338
Hey. T.J. There you are.

93
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:35,977
Oh, God, I was supposed to meet you
in the infirmary, wasn't I?

94
00:07:36,054 --> 00:07:37,248
About 20 minutes ago.

95
00:07:37,322 --> 00:07:38,789
Sorry.

96
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,952
Are you okay?

97
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,591
Yeah.

98
00:07:44,262 --> 00:07:45,627
You sure?

99
00:07:46,798 --> 00:07:49,164
After everything that's happened to you...

100
00:07:49,234 --> 00:07:50,565
Let's not do this here, okay?

101
00:07:50,635 --> 00:07:54,196
Okay, but look,
you really should talk to someone.

102
00:07:55,507 --> 00:07:58,568
And I'm not saying that it has to be me.

103
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,772
If there's someone else you'd feel
more comfortable confiding in...

104
00:08:01,847 --> 00:08:03,109
It's not that.

105
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:04,308
Then why aren't you...

106
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,408
Because there's nothing
to talk about, Chloe.

107
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:11,613
Look, I lost my baby.

108
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,255
And now maybe she's in a better place.

109
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:19,730
And maybe it's for the best.

110
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,666
You can't mean that.

111
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,736
Let's go to the infirmary
and I'll take a look at your leg wound.

112
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,935
There is no leg wound.

113
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:32,038
That's what I was coming by to tell you.

114
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,170
It's almost completely healed.

115
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,312
How is that possible?

116
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,875
I don't know.

117
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:13,513
We'd cover a lot more ground
if we split up.

118
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,577
You heard the colonel.
"Proceed with caution."

119
00:09:15,654 --> 00:09:17,645
We are not splitting up.

120
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:21,090
Fine. Then let's at least
turn the Kino on search mode.

121
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,627
Yeah, knock yourself out.

122
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,904
A fascinating bit of information.

123
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:45,980
Of course you know what this means.

124
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,478
We may have a way of getting home.

125
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:54,390
But you're not going to tell them that,
are you?

126
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:59,059
Well, I'm sure they'll figure it out
on their own.

127
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:01,761
And if they don't?

128
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:23,746
Well, well, well.
What do we have here?

129
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:27,283
Ship's control center, I'm guessing.

130
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:30,822
Huh. And I was gonna go with rec room.

131
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,367
Hey, what did the colonel say?

132
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:45,468
He said, "You've got two hours.
Make it fast."

133
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,107
Colonel, this is Scott.

134
00:10:48,683 --> 00:10:49,775
Go ahead.

135
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,512
<i>We've found what appears to be
the ship's control center.</i>

136
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:55,714
<i>Brody and Dr. Volker are bringing
systems online for study.</i>

137
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,281
Keep me updated. Where the hell were you?

138
00:10:58,659 --> 00:10:59,819
I stopped by the mess.

139
00:10:59,894 --> 00:11:00,952
Well, I tried radioing you.

140
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:02,052
Yeah, I know.

141
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:07,230
Everett, can I talk to you for a second?

142
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,367
Sure.

143
00:11:13,274 --> 00:11:15,003
- You sent a team over?
- Yeah.

144
00:11:15,076 --> 00:11:16,509
Without bothering to run it by me?

145
00:11:16,577 --> 00:11:19,102
Last time I checked, I was
the commanding officer of this ship.

146
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,738
- I'm not disputing that...
- Meaning, I don't have to run

147
00:11:20,815 --> 00:11:22,043
anything by you or anyone else,
for that matter.

148
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:24,550
Look, I don't have a problem
with sending a team over.

149
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:27,917
I'd just appreciate being kept in the loop.
Let me help.

150
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,888
I don't need your help.

151
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:32,822
- Like hell you don't.
- David...

152
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:34,622
Damn it, Everett...

153
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,594
You've been going this alone
since the incursion,

154
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,361
and it's been taking a toll.

155
00:11:40,935 --> 00:11:43,130
When are you going to realize
that this isn't just about you?

156
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:46,098
You have a responsibility
to the people on board this ship

157
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:48,403
and lately, you haven't
been up to the task.

158
00:11:48,476 --> 00:11:51,104
Now you either shape up or step back.

159
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:57,582
You're tired, I get it. Let me help.

160
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:01,112
Oh, you're a persistent son of a bitch.

161
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:02,519
Hey, you saved my life.

162
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,887
I had to kill you to do it.

163
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,552
And I'm willing to do the same for you.

164
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:10,856
Okay. They've found what looks to be
the ship's control center

165
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:12,796
and they're bringing systems online.

166
00:12:12,867 --> 00:12:13,993
What's the game plan?

167
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:17,732
The game plan is just get
as much information as we can

168
00:12:17,806 --> 00:12:19,433
before our time runs out.

169
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:56,433
Colonel, I hear we've docked
with a seed ship.

170
00:12:57,512 --> 00:12:58,570
That's right.

171
00:12:58,647 --> 00:12:59,739
I'd like to offer my help.

172
00:12:59,815 --> 00:13:01,942
I have some understanding
of Ancient technology...

173
00:13:02,017 --> 00:13:03,109
No, thank you.

174
00:13:03,185 --> 00:13:04,812
- But I can be of some assistance...
- I said no.

175
00:13:05,453 --> 00:13:08,149
I'm not letting you or your people
anywhere near that ship.

176
00:13:10,058 --> 00:13:11,650
You wanted to see me?

177
00:13:13,628 --> 00:13:16,119
I want to know how long
you plan on keeping us locked up?

178
00:13:16,198 --> 00:13:17,495
I didn't really have a plan.

179
00:13:17,566 --> 00:13:21,161
I just thought I'd play it by ear,
see how things go.

180
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:23,994
We've been cooperative
with your Homeworld Command,

181
00:13:24,072 --> 00:13:26,905
providing them with information
on the Alliance as requested.

182
00:13:26,975 --> 00:13:27,999
You had no choice.

183
00:13:28,076 --> 00:13:31,443
It was either that or get left behind
on some god-forsaken planet.

184
00:13:31,513 --> 00:13:34,175
We took down Dannic
and gave you back control of this ship.

185
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:35,610
To save your own lives.

186
00:13:35,684 --> 00:13:37,549
Ours weren't the only ones at risk,

187
00:13:37,619 --> 00:13:40,281
and if you remember,
I stepped in and prevented the execution

188
00:13:40,355 --> 00:13:44,122
<i>of all military personnel aboard
Destiny, including you.</i>

189
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:48,521
I think we were better use to you alive.
But for what it's worth, I thank you.

190
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:54,226
We can't spend the rest of our days
here on this ship as prisoners.

191
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,567
Should've thought about that
before you attacked us.

192
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:00,070
The way I see it, it could've gotten
a hell of a lot worse for you.

193
00:14:00,676 --> 00:14:01,938
Colonel, just tell me,

194
00:14:02,612 --> 00:14:04,443
what do we have to do to earn our freedom?

195
00:14:04,513 --> 00:14:05,844
Prove to me that you're not a threat.

196
00:14:06,015 --> 00:14:07,209
And how do we do that?

197
00:14:07,283 --> 00:14:08,682
I don't think you can.

198
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,650
I'm not your enemy anymore.
Neither are my people!

199
00:14:13,923 --> 00:14:15,982
I think you know that.

200
00:14:17,827 --> 00:14:19,226
Told you.

201
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,476
Okay, so making any progress?

202
00:14:35,077 --> 00:14:36,510
Sure.

203
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:39,844
All right, then maybe Sergeant Greer and I
will take a little look around.

204
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,713
Knock yourselves out.

205
00:14:51,594 --> 00:14:53,255
Hey, am I reading this right?

206
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,125
If you have to ask, my guess would be no.

207
00:14:56,532 --> 00:14:59,660
Seriously. Check out these power readings.

208
00:15:02,772 --> 00:15:06,641
Oh, my God.
Dr. Rush, you'd better check this out.

209
00:15:13,216 --> 00:15:14,444
It was you, wasn't it?

210
00:15:14,885 --> 00:15:17,683
You're the one who told the prisoners
about the seed ship?

211
00:15:17,754 --> 00:15:21,520
<i>Any major developments aboard
Destiny concern them as well.</i>

212
00:15:21,591 --> 00:15:22,751
They had a right to know.

213
00:15:22,826 --> 00:15:25,021
Oh, damn it, Camile, they're prisoners.
They don't have any rights.

214
00:15:25,095 --> 00:15:26,221
Oh, I can't believe what I'm hearing.

215
00:15:26,296 --> 00:15:28,457
They attacked the ship, they threatened us.

216
00:15:28,532 --> 00:15:29,897
And now we have to live with them.

217
00:15:29,967 --> 00:15:31,628
No, we don't.

218
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:35,365
We already got rid of most of them.
There's only a handful left.

219
00:15:35,939 --> 00:15:38,032
Homeworld Command needs the intel
they're providing,

220
00:15:38,108 --> 00:15:41,043
and in exchange for that information,
they made a deal.

221
00:15:41,411 --> 00:15:43,845
That Homeworld Command
doesn't have to live with, but we do.

222
00:15:43,914 --> 00:15:47,782
Then all the more reason we should be
showing these people some respect.

223
00:15:48,118 --> 00:15:51,576
You know, if you would just
take the time to get to know them,

224
00:15:51,655 --> 00:15:54,818
you'd realize that many of them didn't
have a choice but to join the Alliance.

225
00:15:54,891 --> 00:15:56,620
You know what, I don't care.

226
00:15:56,693 --> 00:15:59,526
And I'm going to be damned if I risk
the health and welfare of people

227
00:15:59,596 --> 00:16:03,032
aboard this ship on marching orders
from the other side of the universe.

228
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,761
And what about the people back home?

229
00:16:05,135 --> 00:16:07,035
Are you willing to risk
their lives instead?

230
00:16:07,104 --> 00:16:10,835
Because that's what's going to happen
if you renege on this deal.

231
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:14,135
Homeworld Command
has received confirmation

232
00:16:14,211 --> 00:16:17,146
that the Lucian Alliance
is planning an attack on Earth,

233
00:16:17,214 --> 00:16:20,081
and it's quite possible that
these prisoners have information

234
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,879
that could help head off that attack.

235
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:23,877
Or they could be lying.

236
00:16:23,954 --> 00:16:28,789
Yes, sure, they could be, but are you
really willing to take that chance?

237
00:16:30,794 --> 00:16:34,026
Look, I understand.
These last few days have been hard on you.

238
00:16:34,098 --> 00:16:36,157
Camile, do me a favor.

239
00:16:36,234 --> 00:16:38,498
Just watch what you say to the prisoners.

240
00:16:39,604 --> 00:16:44,007
We're planning a service
for Sergeant Riley later this week.

241
00:16:44,642 --> 00:16:47,907
I thought maybe
you'd want to say a few words.

242
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,047
Of course.

243
00:16:55,253 --> 00:16:58,381
So come on. Chen? Ramirez?

244
00:16:58,456 --> 00:17:02,222
That redheaded civilian contractor
with the... Park.

245
00:17:03,428 --> 00:17:04,793
Park?

246
00:17:05,363 --> 00:17:10,096
Yeah. Remember that hamstring injury
I said I got doing squats?

247
00:17:10,268 --> 00:17:11,792
Yeah.

248
00:17:14,072 --> 00:17:16,370
It wasn't doing squats.

249
00:17:22,914 --> 00:17:24,347
You wanted to see me?

250
00:17:24,415 --> 00:17:27,145
We checked, we re-checked,
and re-re-checked just to be sure...

251
00:17:27,218 --> 00:17:29,743
The seed ship has sizable energy reserves.

252
00:17:29,821 --> 00:17:31,015
How sizable?

253
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:35,719
With the output of both capacitors in play,
enough to power the gate and get us home.

254
00:17:35,793 --> 00:17:37,420
In order for that to happen,

255
00:17:37,495 --> 00:17:40,259
I have to alter certain conduits
to open up a transfer channel,

256
00:17:40,331 --> 00:17:41,764
but that's not something
I can do from here.

257
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,130
Go.

258
00:17:57,582 --> 00:17:59,574
- What was that?
What?

259
00:17:59,651 --> 00:18:01,915
We just lost the Kino feed.

260
00:18:04,123 --> 00:18:05,954
Ready, Eli.

261
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,322
<i>Eli?</i>

262
00:18:09,394 --> 00:18:12,886
Yeah. Right. Right.

263
00:18:22,441 --> 00:18:26,172
Dr. Rush, perfect timing.
You're going to want to see this.

264
00:18:27,613 --> 00:18:29,604
Okay, back in a flash.

265
00:18:29,982 --> 00:18:32,143
Uh-huh. Wait. No, where are you going?

266
00:18:32,217 --> 00:18:34,708
Looks like there's a malfunctioning
relay station one floor up.

267
00:18:34,786 --> 00:18:38,222
I'm gonna see if I can fix it,
bring up that dead console.

268
00:18:56,141 --> 00:19:01,443
I'll warn you, Lieutenant, I tend to find
surprises particularly underwhelming.

269
00:19:01,513 --> 00:19:04,243
Not this one, you won't. Trust me.

270
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:12,780
Pretty darn cool, huh?

271
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,994
Yes. Of course.

272
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:25,667
This is where the stargates
were manufactured

273
00:19:25,738 --> 00:19:29,139
before being transported
to the various planets.

274
00:19:30,376 --> 00:19:32,207
Okay. Is that it?

275
00:19:33,846 --> 00:19:35,336
Yeah, that's it.

276
00:19:35,448 --> 00:19:37,211
Well, now we're done
with this little diversion,

277
00:19:37,283 --> 00:19:39,046
could you escort me to the Control Room?

278
00:19:50,363 --> 00:19:52,991
Didn't take you long,
but there's still more that...

279
00:19:56,669 --> 00:19:58,296
Oh, my God.

280
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:01,666
I don't... I don't... Please.

281
00:20:05,378 --> 00:20:07,209
What the hell?

282
00:20:08,214 --> 00:20:10,876
If you're not careful,
that cut's going to open back up again.

283
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:14,317
I can't help it. I like to play rough.

284
00:20:15,688 --> 00:20:16,848
How about you?

285
00:20:18,691 --> 00:20:23,253
I got it. Yeah, I do.

286
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,225
Do you think you could handle me?

287
00:20:32,372 --> 00:20:33,805
No.

288
00:20:34,907 --> 00:20:36,568
I didn't think so.

289
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,679
<i>Lieutenant
Scott, this is Volker.</i>

290
00:20:45,752 --> 00:20:46,878
Go ahead.

291
00:20:46,953 --> 00:20:49,888
<i>You might want to come back
to the Control Room.</i>

292
00:20:49,956 --> 00:20:51,481
You find something interesting?

293
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:54,925
<i>Well, yeah, actually.
Something interesting found me.</i>

294
00:21:04,271 --> 00:21:06,967
Have a seat.
I'd like to take a look at your wound.

295
00:21:10,744 --> 00:21:12,735
Looks like it's healing nicely.

296
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,008
Too bad.
I was kind of hoping for a manly scar.

297
00:21:18,052 --> 00:21:19,485
I'm sorry.

298
00:21:21,088 --> 00:21:23,022
I'm sorry your child couldn't be saved.

299
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:31,631
It's difficult to lose someone you love.
I know.

300
00:21:33,801 --> 00:21:35,962
My wife, Anthea, three years ago.

301
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:40,068
She was on her way back from the market,
when she was caught in a rainstorm.

302
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,575
She ended up taking refuge in a shelter.

303
00:21:43,911 --> 00:21:47,005
It collapsed, killing her and six others.

304
00:21:47,581 --> 00:21:49,014
I'm sorry.

305
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:54,050
She never liked me being in the Alliance.
She thought it was too dangerous.

306
00:21:55,756 --> 00:21:57,587
I risked my life time and again,

307
00:21:57,658 --> 00:22:00,092
survived missions
that should have killed me,

308
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:05,393
and yet she dies doing something
as mundane as getting caught in the rain.

309
00:22:05,999 --> 00:22:07,626
You felt guilty.

310
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:10,795
Guilty. Angry. Despondent.

311
00:22:12,673 --> 00:22:15,836
I was miserable,
until I came to an understanding.

312
00:22:16,744 --> 00:22:17,905
And what was that?

313
00:22:19,748 --> 00:22:21,545
That life is loss.

314
00:22:26,087 --> 00:22:27,987
<i>T. J?</i>

315
00:22:31,326 --> 00:22:32,384
Sir?

316
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,291
<i>Grab your med kit
and meet me at the airlock.</i>

317
00:22:34,362 --> 00:22:35,761
<i>You're heading over
to the seed ship.</i>

318
00:22:36,464 --> 00:22:38,398
<i>- Is anyone hurt?
- Not exactly.</i>

319
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:43,496
According to Scott,
the alien is alive but unresponsive.

320
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:44,868
How'd it even get on the ship?

321
00:22:44,939 --> 00:22:46,429
No idea.

322
00:22:46,508 --> 00:22:48,066
Okay. I'll do my best.

323
00:22:48,143 --> 00:22:50,407
You sure you don't want me to use
the stones, bring someone else in?

324
00:22:50,478 --> 00:22:52,241
No. Sir, I want to do this.

325
00:22:52,313 --> 00:22:53,746
All right.

326
00:22:55,817 --> 00:22:56,806
I'm going with.

327
00:22:56,885 --> 00:22:59,217
The lieutenant
already has an escort.

328
00:23:00,021 --> 00:23:01,886
I'm tired of sitting on the sidelines.
Put me in, coach.

329
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:04,486
Okay.

330
00:23:06,461 --> 00:23:07,655
Eli.

331
00:23:14,335 --> 00:23:16,803
Good luck. T.J.

332
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:18,864
I got it.

333
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,355
Hey.

334
00:23:39,761 --> 00:23:40,887
You sure it's alive?

335
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:42,361
It's breathing.

336
00:23:42,897 --> 00:23:44,525
At least that's what
we think it's doing.

337
00:23:57,146 --> 00:23:59,239
Lieutenant?

338
00:23:59,849 --> 00:24:01,680
I'm fine. I'm fine.

339
00:24:15,498 --> 00:24:16,931
Little help here, Rush?

340
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,732
Me?

341
00:24:19,101 --> 00:24:21,729
You're the only one with any
experience communicating with aliens.

342
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:23,964
Different aliens.

343
00:24:25,741 --> 00:24:28,767
However, I think a good first step
might be to lower your weapons.

344
00:24:52,201 --> 00:24:55,193
Scott. Scott.

345
00:24:56,272 --> 00:24:59,673
You? Understand?

346
00:25:01,043 --> 00:25:02,567
No?

347
00:25:06,949 --> 00:25:08,246
No.

348
00:25:09,251 --> 00:25:11,982
Does anybody have any food? Anybody?

349
00:25:12,055 --> 00:25:16,492
Yeah. No, I've got a piece of dried fruit
that I was saving for later.

350
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,460
Are you kidding? That stuff's horrible.

351
00:25:18,695 --> 00:25:19,719
It tastes like rambutan.

352
00:25:19,796 --> 00:25:22,026
- Tastes like crap.
- What's rambutan?

353
00:25:22,098 --> 00:25:23,588
It's sort of like a longan.

354
00:25:24,334 --> 00:25:25,699
- Longan?
- Are you...

355
00:25:25,769 --> 00:25:27,999
Just give it here.

356
00:25:35,312 --> 00:25:37,712
Mmm. Good.

357
00:25:52,362 --> 00:25:53,420
What'd I say?

358
00:25:53,496 --> 00:25:57,057
You know, it may be wise to find out
whether or not it came alone.

359
00:25:58,568 --> 00:26:00,092
He's right. We should run a sweep.

360
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:03,430
You two keep our guest company.
Each of you take a corridor.

361
00:26:03,506 --> 00:26:05,406
Radio check-in, 10 minutes.

362
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,445
<i>Eli, this is Dr.
Rush. Come in.</i>

363
00:26:19,522 --> 00:26:21,854
<i>- Go ahead.
- I'm initiating the transfer.</i>

364
00:26:22,092 --> 00:26:25,528
I need you to isolate the power
and direct it towards the gate.

365
00:26:59,664 --> 00:27:01,222
It's working.

366
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:06,291
Power from both ships is being
transferred directly to the gate.

367
00:27:38,335 --> 00:27:40,098
<i>Colonel, Lieutenant.</i>

368
00:27:40,171 --> 00:27:41,195
Go ahead, Master Sergeant.

369
00:27:41,572 --> 00:27:45,167
Yeah, it seems that the alien is not alone.

370
00:27:47,445 --> 00:27:49,140
It's got friends,

371
00:27:50,347 --> 00:27:52,338
and plenty of them.

372
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,812
<i>Very shortly, we will be
making an attempt to dial Earth.</i>

373
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:03,622
<i>If a successful connection is made,
we will need to move quickly.</i>

374
00:28:04,096 --> 00:28:07,793
<i>All crew members are to proceed
to the Gate Room immediately.</i>

375
00:28:09,201 --> 00:28:10,259
Come again?

376
00:28:10,335 --> 00:28:12,462
<i>Greer has discovered
several more pods, all empty,</i>

377
00:28:12,537 --> 00:28:14,767
suggesting there are more
of these things on board.

378
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,705
<i>Well, how many more?</i>

379
00:28:17,175 --> 00:28:19,666
About a dozen.
Rush figures they were a research team

380
00:28:19,778 --> 00:28:21,973
who were dropped off to do
a long-term study of the ship.

381
00:28:22,047 --> 00:28:23,139
<i>Well, let's get our
people out of there</i>

382
00:28:23,215 --> 00:28:25,183
before their ride comes back
to pick them up.

383
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,911
<i>Making our way to the Control Room.</i>

384
00:28:26,985 --> 00:28:29,852
<i>I want Rush and the science team
back on the Destiny now.</i>

385
00:28:29,921 --> 00:28:31,582
<i>Do you understand?</i>

386
00:28:31,656 --> 00:28:32,918
Yes, sir.

387
00:28:32,991 --> 00:28:34,322
I can't leave just yet.

388
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,559
What is it now, Rush?

389
00:28:36,628 --> 00:28:40,257
<i>I should stay here in case there's any
interruption to the power transfer.</i>

390
00:28:40,565 --> 00:28:42,294
We may only have one shot at this.

391
00:28:42,601 --> 00:28:44,262
Well, what's the situation with the alien?

392
00:28:45,771 --> 00:28:46,999
Docile. Not a threat.

393
00:28:47,072 --> 00:28:48,403
<i>You can't know that for sure.</i>

394
00:28:48,473 --> 00:28:50,304
Colonel, there's really no point
in arguing about this.

395
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:52,605
I have to stay here to
make sure this works.

396
00:28:53,478 --> 00:28:55,742
All right, fine. I'll send reinforcements.

397
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:59,777
I would advise against that.

398
00:28:59,851 --> 00:29:01,409
<i>I'm sending them anyway.</i>

399
00:29:04,055 --> 00:29:07,582
Okay, I'll head back once a stable
wormhole has been established.

400
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:10,093
<i>All right.
Airman Dunning, you're with Rush.</i>

401
00:29:10,162 --> 00:29:13,859
Everyone else fall back.
Go. Bring the alien.

402
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:19,933
Power buffers are at optimum.
We're good to go.

403
00:29:24,776 --> 00:29:26,300
Commencing dialing sequence.

404
00:29:26,378 --> 00:29:30,145
People, Homeworld Command
is expecting us. Here we go.

405
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,683
Bring the prisoners.

406
00:29:41,127 --> 00:29:42,389
It's working.

407
00:29:45,264 --> 00:29:46,856
<i>The gate's dialing.</i>

408
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:49,164
Let me know when you
secure the connection.

409
00:29:51,003 --> 00:29:52,834
We're going home.

410
00:29:59,212 --> 00:30:00,804
- What happened?
- I don't know.

411
00:30:01,514 --> 00:30:04,039
Eli? Eli?

412
00:30:05,818 --> 00:30:07,945
The power transfer's been interrupted.
Hang on.

413
00:30:11,524 --> 00:30:13,822
Rush? Rush, what's happening?

414
00:30:14,293 --> 00:30:17,490
I'm not sure, but it appears that
tapping this ship's energy reserves

415
00:30:17,563 --> 00:30:19,121
seems more problematical than we thought.

416
00:30:31,344 --> 00:30:32,675
Uh-oh.

417
00:30:37,116 --> 00:30:38,913
Eli, what the hell was that?

418
00:30:39,552 --> 00:30:44,046
We've got a problem.
The energy transfer's been reversed!

419
00:30:44,657 --> 00:30:46,022
Dr. Rush, did you hear that?

420
00:30:46,092 --> 00:30:49,960
<i>The seed ship has begun drawing power
away from Destiny.</i>

421
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:52,220
<i>Dr. Rush?</i>

422
00:30:56,803 --> 00:30:59,033
Colonel Young,
we just lost contact with Rush.

423
00:31:02,943 --> 00:31:05,776
Dunning. Dunning, are you there?

424
00:31:07,681 --> 00:31:12,084
<i>David, I need you to go to the Control Room
and find out why Rush isn't responding.</i>

425
00:31:12,786 --> 00:31:13,844
We're already on our way.

426
00:31:13,921 --> 00:31:17,186
<i>T.J., Marsden, and the science team are
headed back to Destiny with the alien.</i>

427
00:31:17,257 --> 00:31:18,918
<i>Have you found any more?</i>

428
00:31:18,992 --> 00:31:20,482
Not yet.

429
00:31:21,428 --> 00:31:22,452
Talk to me, Eli.

430
00:31:23,163 --> 00:31:26,360
<i>The seed ship is still drawing power
away from Destiny.</i>

431
00:31:26,934 --> 00:31:29,095
When the reserves are gone,
there's no getting them back.

432
00:31:29,169 --> 00:31:31,967
Pretty soon, we won't even be
able to make an FTL jump.

433
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:34,803
- So we can't stop it?
- We're trying, but nothing's working.

434
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:36,570
What if we disconnect from the seed ship?

435
00:31:37,277 --> 00:31:38,972
Yeah, that would sever the power flow.

436
00:31:39,046 --> 00:31:41,708
Unfortunately,
we have no idea how to do that.

437
00:31:41,782 --> 00:31:43,374
We've got to learn.
We've got to learn fast.

438
00:31:59,199 --> 00:32:02,498
Colonel, this is T.J. We lost the alien.

439
00:32:02,569 --> 00:32:03,729
Copy that.

440
00:32:11,745 --> 00:32:13,235
Check them.

441
00:32:19,853 --> 00:32:21,481
He's still breathing.

442
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,987
<i>David.</i>

443
00:32:25,727 --> 00:32:27,786
We've found Rush and Dunning.
They're unconscious.

444
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,422
It doesn't look like we'll be able to
stop the power transfer,

445
00:32:30,498 --> 00:32:33,399
so our only option is to sever the link
between the two ships.

446
00:32:33,468 --> 00:32:36,528
<i>We need you back here
in order to disconnect.</i>

447
00:32:40,008 --> 00:32:41,703
Negative.

448
00:32:43,177 --> 00:32:44,371
This is our one shot at getting home.

449
00:32:44,445 --> 00:32:46,072
There's got to be a way
to reverse the transfer.

450
00:32:47,081 --> 00:32:49,208
Eli's tried and come up short.
Listen to me, David.

451
00:32:49,283 --> 00:32:51,478
<i>I want nothing more
than to get everyone back home,</i>

452
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:54,214
but I'm not willing to risk
anyone's life to do it.

453
00:32:56,324 --> 00:32:57,450
Put Eli on.

454
00:32:59,427 --> 00:33:00,689
Go on.

455
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,660
Colonel?

456
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,893
<i>Is there a way to reverse the
transfer from my end?</i>

457
00:33:10,271 --> 00:33:11,397
Eli?

458
00:33:11,472 --> 00:33:13,531
Theoretically, yeah. Yeah, it's possible.

459
00:33:13,808 --> 00:33:15,332
Tell me what to do.

460
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:19,175
You need to find anything that
resembles a schematic

461
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:22,341
or an active display,
possibly indicative of the power transfer.

462
00:33:24,118 --> 00:33:26,279
Greer, Scott, get those two back to safety.

463
00:33:27,622 --> 00:33:31,080
Sir, those aliens are probably
responsible for what's happened.

464
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:32,956
- If they come back here, you wilI...
- Go.

465
00:33:34,529 --> 00:33:35,791
Go!

466
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,231
All right, I got it.

467
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:44,598
<i>Okay, now,
I'm going to walk you through this.</i>

468
00:33:44,672 --> 00:33:45,798
Forget walking. Let's sprint.

469
00:33:45,873 --> 00:33:48,502
I've got a basic knowledge
of Ancient systems.

470
00:33:48,577 --> 00:33:51,375
Okay, you need to access
the ship's distribution network.

471
00:33:55,717 --> 00:33:56,843
How are we doing for time?

472
00:33:59,054 --> 00:34:01,614
Once we hit red,
we're at the point of no return.

473
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:03,282
We have less than 15 minutes.

474
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:31,643
We're locked out.

475
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:37,656
Wake up.

476
00:34:39,795 --> 00:34:41,057
What the hell?

477
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:43,761
Forget it. Keep moving.

478
00:34:54,143 --> 00:34:55,633
Eli, I'm done. What's next?

479
00:34:56,044 --> 00:34:58,672
Now you need to open a secondary conduit.

480
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:09,157
It's not budging.

481
00:35:23,206 --> 00:35:26,266
It's no use. We are cut off
from the Control Room. Fall back.

482
00:35:26,342 --> 00:35:28,469
All right, you guys heard the man.
Let's fall back.

483
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,176
Less than six minutes.

484
00:35:35,251 --> 00:35:37,981
Are we any closer to finding a way
to disconnect from the seed ship?

485
00:35:39,422 --> 00:35:40,514
We need Rush.

486
00:35:41,057 --> 00:35:42,115
Eli.

487
00:35:45,495 --> 00:35:48,658
Lieutenant Scott. Come in.
We need Rush in the Control Room now.

488
00:35:49,299 --> 00:35:50,823
Dr. Rush?

489
00:35:53,603 --> 00:35:55,036
He is gone, sir.

490
00:35:55,405 --> 00:35:56,804
He's gone where?

491
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,901
<i>- I don't know.
- Find him.</i>

492
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:04,670
Look, there's no way we're going
to figure out how to disconnect in time.

493
00:36:05,181 --> 00:36:07,012
It's all up to Colonel Telford.

494
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:08,812
Less than four minutes.

495
00:36:10,853 --> 00:36:11,979
David, how's it coming?

496
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,457
Almost there.

497
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:20,955
<i>Okay. Next?</i>

498
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:23,658
Okay, now, all you have to do
is override the power relay

499
00:36:23,733 --> 00:36:26,099
and just re-route it back through
the channel you've just created.

500
00:36:30,373 --> 00:36:31,897
Three minutes.

501
00:36:37,413 --> 00:36:38,938
Almost there.

502
00:36:54,898 --> 00:36:56,866
<i>- What was that?
No idea.</i>

503
00:36:57,268 --> 00:36:59,293
- Eli?
- We just disconnected from the seed ship.

504
00:36:59,503 --> 00:37:01,198
Wait a minute. I thought you said...

505
00:37:01,272 --> 00:37:02,830
I didn't.

506
00:37:04,174 --> 00:37:05,471
It wasn't me.

507
00:37:06,543 --> 00:37:07,737
Well, then, how?

508
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,469
How?

509
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:31,998
I had no choice.

510
00:37:32,202 --> 00:37:34,363
In order to save the crew?

511
00:37:35,105 --> 00:37:37,369
Or did you do it to save your dream?

512
00:37:38,409 --> 00:37:40,377
Which was it, Nicholas?

513
00:37:56,427 --> 00:37:58,588
David, we just disconnected
from the seed ship

514
00:37:58,662 --> 00:38:02,428
<i>and we're about to jump into FTL.
I'm sorry.</i>

515
00:38:10,408 --> 00:38:12,171
Can't blame me for trying, right?

516
00:38:13,244 --> 00:38:15,508
Yeah. Yeah.

517
00:38:31,429 --> 00:38:33,397
Take care of those people.

518
00:38:37,369 --> 00:38:39,030
<i>And Everett,</i>

519
00:38:40,105 --> 00:38:41,936
take care of yourself.

520
00:39:10,435 --> 00:39:11,595
Everett?

521
00:39:13,338 --> 00:39:14,703
<i>Destiny, are you there?</i>

522
00:40:08,594 --> 00:40:12,724
I understand that you made
saving me a priority after I was shot.

523
00:40:13,766 --> 00:40:15,427
You didn't have to.

524
00:40:15,501 --> 00:40:16,900
Of course I did.

525
00:40:18,804 --> 00:40:20,294
Anyways, thank you.

526
00:40:41,727 --> 00:40:48,633
<i>In the dark it feels so real</i>

527
00:40:54,740 --> 00:41:00,304
<i>And all this time we've
been sleeping on it</i>

528
00:41:07,988 --> 00:41:11,355
<i>And who we are</i>

529
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:16,828
<i>And what we're going through</i>

530
00:41:21,167 --> 00:41:27,003
<i>All this time spent saving for it</i>

531
00:41:36,216 --> 00:41:39,208
<i>Come so far</i>

532
00:41:49,529 --> 00:41:53,090
<i>Come so far, yeah</i>

533
00:41:56,136 --> 00:42:01,870
<i>So just let me know
when we get there</i>

534
00:42:02,909 --> 00:42:05,878
<i>If we get there</i>

535
00:42:11,585 --> 00:42:15,180
<i>Let me know when we get there</i>

536
00:42:15,989 --> 00:42:18,583
<i>If we get there</i>
