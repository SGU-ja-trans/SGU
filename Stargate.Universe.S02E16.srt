1
00:00:04,196 --> 00:00:08,724
<i>I may be on the verge of discovering
the true nature ofDestiny's mission.</i>

2
00:00:10,102 --> 00:00:13,036
<i>You've had control of this ship
the whole time!</i>

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,501
Why wouldn't you tell anyone?

4
00:00:14,605 --> 00:00:17,472
The Lucian Alliance is planning an
attack on Earth.

5
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:21,101
<i>I killed Riley.
I suffocated him with my own hands.</i>

6
00:00:21,178 --> 00:00:23,169
You are a good commander.

7
00:00:23,547 --> 00:00:26,310
<i>There is no mission other
than getting these people home.</i>

8
00:00:26,382 --> 00:00:29,579
<i>It was never about going home, it's
about getting us to where we're going.</i>

9
00:00:29,652 --> 00:00:31,882
That is the mission.

10
00:00:32,956 --> 00:00:35,720
<i>And this is Varro, one
of our remaining Alliance guests.</i>

11
00:00:35,792 --> 00:00:36,884
I haven't seen you in a while.

12
00:00:37,293 --> 00:00:38,316
Your kidneys are failing.

13
00:00:38,393 --> 00:00:39,917
End-stage renal disease.

14
00:00:39,995 --> 00:00:42,930
The only other option for treatment
would be a transplant.

15
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:45,758
He won't reject it.

16
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:47,127
Great, no pressure.

17
00:00:47,436 --> 00:00:49,370
There might be a little infection
setting in there.

18
00:00:49,471 --> 00:00:50,733
I'm fine.

19
00:00:51,772 --> 00:00:54,002
- Eli, what the hell did you do?
- Goodbye.

20
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:57,135
<i>I transferred the memory where
they were stored into quarantine.</i>

21
00:00:57,211 --> 00:00:59,611
<i>They're cut off from the
rest of the ship now, and us.</i>

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,615
That's what I did. To save you.

23
00:01:04,985 --> 00:01:08,148
Wow. Space deer.
They're beautiful.

24
00:01:08,255 --> 00:01:10,519
They're going to look
even more beautiful

25
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,720
slow-roasted and served up
with a side of Becker's mash.

26
00:01:15,095 --> 00:01:16,824
You're not serious.

27
00:01:17,397 --> 00:01:19,830
Uh... And how exactly would you cook 'em?

28
00:01:20,499 --> 00:01:22,990
- I wouldn't. I'm a vegetarian.
- No.

29
00:01:23,068 --> 00:01:25,696
For the past 10 months,
we have all been vegetarian.

30
00:01:25,804 --> 00:01:28,329
I am dying for a steak.

31
00:01:29,475 --> 00:01:30,703
I could use a steak.

32
00:01:30,942 --> 00:01:32,500
No, you guys can't kill those creatures,

33
00:01:32,577 --> 00:01:34,943
and this has nothing to do
with being a vegetarian.

34
00:01:35,013 --> 00:01:36,002
I mean,
we don't know anything about them.

35
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,308
They could be intelligent.

36
00:01:37,382 --> 00:01:40,317
We just saw one of them eat its own vomit.
How smart can they be?

37
00:01:40,752 --> 00:01:42,845
Guys! I could use some help over here.

38
00:01:43,821 --> 00:01:45,720
Okay, look, I'll tell you what,

39
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:50,817
if they can give me one good reason
why I shouldn't eat them, I won't,

40
00:01:51,094 --> 00:01:54,086
but it better be a good one,
because I am mighty hungry.

41
00:01:54,798 --> 00:01:56,789
- Lieutenant?
Let's do it.

42
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:01,331
Not cool.

43
00:02:17,752 --> 00:02:20,220
- Want me to take it?
- No. No.

44
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:22,950
I got it.

45
00:02:28,062 --> 00:02:29,927
- Damn!
- What the heck happened?

46
00:02:31,532 --> 00:02:33,329
Something must've spooked them.

47
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,732
We've got plenty of time.
Want to go after 'em?

48
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,666
Hell, yeah.

49
00:02:42,642 --> 00:02:44,667
- What was that?
- Hang on.

50
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,589
Shoot! Shoot it!

51
00:03:24,414 --> 00:03:25,540
<i>Shoot it!</i>

52
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,910
<i>It's heading for the camp!</i>

53
00:03:32,988 --> 00:03:34,683
By the time we got there, it was gone.

54
00:03:35,124 --> 00:03:36,921
Was anybody hurt?

55
00:03:36,992 --> 00:03:41,588
No fatalities, but plenty of injuries,
and two missing.

56
00:03:41,664 --> 00:03:44,257
Reynolds and T.J.

57
00:03:47,135 --> 00:03:49,228
- Permission to go after them, sir.
- Permission denied.

58
00:03:49,304 --> 00:03:51,397
Sir, I know things may look bad,
but there is still a chance

59
00:03:51,472 --> 00:03:53,064
that T.J. and Reynolds
could be alive down there.

60
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:56,076
Which is why we need to find them
as fast as possible.

61
00:03:56,144 --> 00:03:57,701
I'm going to need you here, Lieutenant.

62
00:03:57,778 --> 00:04:00,645
While I'm gone, you're in charge.
You got a problem with that?

63
00:04:00,747 --> 00:04:02,977
No, sir.

64
00:04:15,127 --> 00:04:16,992
Hey! What are you doing?

65
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,191
Checking to see what's inside.

66
00:04:20,066 --> 00:04:21,294
Why, what does it look like I'm doing?

67
00:04:21,867 --> 00:04:23,129
Come on.

68
00:04:23,903 --> 00:04:27,133
I thought the whole point of exploring
unexplored sections of the ship

69
00:04:27,205 --> 00:04:29,696
was to, well, explore them.

70
00:04:29,908 --> 00:04:31,773
- We are.
- Yeah? Not really.

71
00:04:32,243 --> 00:04:35,576
Well, what can I say?
Rush wants us to take a cautious approach.

72
00:04:35,647 --> 00:04:37,705
Who cares what Rush thinks?
He's not our boss.

73
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:39,544
You tell him that.

74
00:04:39,616 --> 00:04:41,015
- I will.
- No, you won't.

75
00:04:41,085 --> 00:04:43,451
- I am not afraid of him.
- Afraid of whom?

76
00:04:44,188 --> 00:04:48,386
"Who." I think it's "who." "Afraid of who."

77
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:50,123
Afraid not.

78
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:53,790
Hey, what've we got here?

79
00:04:54,797 --> 00:04:57,425
This is one of the last
rooms in this section.

80
00:04:58,701 --> 00:05:01,067
I'm guessing more Ancient containers.

81
00:05:12,114 --> 00:05:14,048
I want to see them rescued
as much as anyone,

82
00:05:14,383 --> 00:05:17,647
but we have to consider the possibility
that they may already be dead.

83
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:21,051
We swept the area. If they were dead,
why didn't we find the bodies?

84
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:23,613
Maybe the creature dragged them away,

85
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:25,620
took them somewhere
it wouldn't be disturbed.

86
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:31,161
Neither of them
are responding to radio communications.

87
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:32,357
Maybe they're unconscious,

88
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:35,196
or their radios were lost or damaged,
I don't know.

89
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,259
All I'm saying is we can hope for the best

90
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,529
as long as we're prepared for the worst.

91
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:42,336
You're right.
Why don't you guys meet us at the gate?

92
00:05:49,748 --> 00:05:53,377
You mind telling me
what happened back there on the planet?

93
00:05:53,652 --> 00:05:56,485
You had the shot, you didn't take it.
Why not?

94
00:05:57,588 --> 00:05:58,714
I don't know.

95
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,018
If it's a moment of indecision

96
00:06:00,258 --> 00:06:03,159
just one of those things,
then you can drop it,

97
00:06:03,227 --> 00:06:06,719
but if there is a problem,
you need to find out what it is,

98
00:06:06,798 --> 00:06:08,857
and you need to fix it. Fast.

99
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:10,629
Yes, sir.

100
00:06:15,739 --> 00:06:18,435
- Stasis pods?
- Yeah.

101
00:06:19,376 --> 00:06:22,504
Obviously designed
for lengthy intergalactic journeys.

102
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:25,206
We've got multiple rooms
exactly like this one, going both ways.

103
00:06:25,714 --> 00:06:27,375
It's fascinating.

104
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,543
That's a bit of an understatement.
This is huge.

105
00:06:30,586 --> 00:06:31,780
Agreed.

106
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:35,818
Okay, let's leave it for now. Let's go.

107
00:06:36,325 --> 00:06:38,383
What? You can't be serious.

108
00:06:38,526 --> 00:06:41,757
Well, given recent events, it may be wise

109
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,493
to check over the ship's data
on this compartment before proceeding.

110
00:06:58,545 --> 00:07:00,945
Sergeant, hold up.
I think we lost its trail.

111
00:07:01,014 --> 00:07:04,074
- We should double back.
- Well, we need to keep moving forward.

112
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,481
Well, not if we're headed the wrong way.

113
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:08,987
Back the way we came is the wrong way.

114
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:13,287
We keep moving forward,
we'll pick up the trail again. Trust me.

115
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,585
All right, you guys check out the area,
see if you can spot any tracks.

116
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,828
Sergeant. What's up?

117
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,624
We're up against the clock here, sir.

118
00:07:23,702 --> 00:07:26,330
Which is why we can't afford
to make any more mistakes.

119
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,634
Listen to me,
I know this is tearing you apart,

120
00:07:28,707 --> 00:07:30,504
but what's done is done.

121
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,371
And you let guilt
start dictating your actions,

122
00:07:32,443 --> 00:07:33,603
you're just asking for trouble.

123
00:07:33,677 --> 00:07:36,339
I don't know, maybe you needed more time
to recuperate after surgery.

124
00:07:37,948 --> 00:07:39,279
I'm fine, sir.

125
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,043
Then get your head on straight.

126
00:07:44,153 --> 00:07:45,916
James, Marsden...

127
00:08:11,612 --> 00:08:12,840
Any updates from the planet?

128
00:08:14,015 --> 00:08:18,042
They've lost the trail,
so they're doubling back.

129
00:08:20,721 --> 00:08:23,315
I'd like to volunteer to help
with this rescue op.

130
00:08:23,991 --> 00:08:26,857
Well, much appreciated,
but Colonel Young and his team

131
00:08:26,927 --> 00:08:29,191
are more than capable
of seeing this through.

132
00:08:29,262 --> 00:08:31,059
With all due respect, no, they're not.

133
00:08:31,398 --> 00:08:34,026
They have the training,
but they lack the necessary experience.

134
00:08:34,301 --> 00:08:37,134
Me and my people
have been hunting most of our lives.

135
00:08:37,203 --> 00:08:39,227
We can track this animal for you.

136
00:08:39,305 --> 00:08:41,068
We can do it better, faster than anyone

137
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,665
you've got down there
on the ground right now.

138
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:49,545
When this is over,
you're gonna wanna know

139
00:08:49,615 --> 00:08:52,412
that you did everything in your power
to save them.

140
00:08:53,418 --> 00:08:54,612
Right?

141
00:08:58,723 --> 00:09:00,748
Well, it happened so fast.

142
00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:04,591
One minute I was helping
to catalog plant samples,

143
00:09:04,661 --> 00:09:07,653
and the next I was on the ground
and everyone was screaming.

144
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:09,925
Hey. I just heard.

145
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:11,261
Come to check up on us, huh?

146
00:09:12,235 --> 00:09:14,999
Yeah. Yeah, I came to check up on you both.

147
00:09:15,272 --> 00:09:17,899
- How are you?
- In constant pain.

148
00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:20,441
I think my ankle's broken.
Every time I move...

149
00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:23,171
Well, hang in there. How about you?

150
00:09:23,245 --> 00:09:25,907
According to the medical scan,
a cracked rib.

151
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,314
Ha! I should be so lucky.

152
00:09:28,684 --> 00:09:30,413
How do you...
How do you treat a cracked rib?

153
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:35,184
You don't. Speaking from personal
experience, snowboarding accident,

154
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:38,383
you just take it easy.
It'll heal itself in about a month.

155
00:09:38,793 --> 00:09:40,283
In a month?

156
00:09:41,162 --> 00:09:44,187
Okay. Is there anything you need?
Anything I can do?

157
00:09:44,264 --> 00:09:45,595
Yeah, could you take off my sock?

158
00:09:46,033 --> 00:09:48,092
- Are you serious, dude?
- My foot's swelling up!

159
00:09:48,335 --> 00:09:49,563
I'll get that for you.

160
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,140
- Thanks for coming by.
- Yeah, it was nothing.

161
00:09:55,242 --> 00:09:58,074
Rush had me up on the bridge
running diagnostics.

162
00:09:58,144 --> 00:09:59,270
I really appreciate it.

163
00:10:02,015 --> 00:10:05,917
Yeah, no, I just wanted to make sure
you were all right.

164
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:22,691
Lieutenant?

165
00:10:23,468 --> 00:10:24,456
Lieutenant!

166
00:10:27,738 --> 00:10:29,069
Oh, thank God.

167
00:10:36,747 --> 00:10:38,373
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

168
00:10:38,715 --> 00:10:40,478
How did we get here?

169
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,318
The thing that attacked the camp,
it took us here.

170
00:10:43,386 --> 00:10:45,286
We must've lost our sidearms
in the commotion.

171
00:10:45,355 --> 00:10:46,515
Your radio, too.

172
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:49,558
Here, I've got mine, but it's damaged.

173
00:10:58,901 --> 00:11:00,129
We have to get out of here.

174
00:11:02,004 --> 00:11:05,097
I can't put any weight on my leg.
I think it might be broken.

175
00:11:09,911 --> 00:11:11,879
It could just be a fracture. Hang tight.

176
00:11:15,249 --> 00:11:17,842
If this thing wanted to kill us,
we'd be dead already.

177
00:11:17,918 --> 00:11:20,113
So I figure that's a good thing, right?
It wants us alive.

178
00:11:25,158 --> 00:11:26,318
It's saving us.

179
00:11:27,761 --> 00:11:28,853
Saving us? From what?

180
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,123
Not from anything.

181
00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:35,758
It's saving us for later.

182
00:11:39,739 --> 00:11:41,764
- I don't like it.
- Yeah, well, you don't have to like it,

183
00:11:41,841 --> 00:11:44,604
just pretend you do,
at least until we get our people back.

184
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,368
Here they come.

185
00:11:50,415 --> 00:11:51,780
It's about time.

186
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,043
We just wanted to check out the campsite.

187
00:11:54,452 --> 00:11:57,511
- We appreciate your help.
- Don't mention it.

188
00:11:57,588 --> 00:11:59,317
We're all in this together, right?

189
00:12:04,161 --> 00:12:07,221
The fact that there's no significant blood
at the campsite is a good sign.

190
00:12:07,297 --> 00:12:09,265
It suggests the creature wanted them alive.

191
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,888
Why?

192
00:12:11,467 --> 00:12:12,798
Probably likes its meat fresh.

193
00:12:13,336 --> 00:12:15,497
Which means we've got to move quickly.

194
00:12:15,805 --> 00:12:17,568
The sooner we locate them, the better,

195
00:12:17,974 --> 00:12:22,934
because this rescue op has the potential
to turn into a recovery mission real fast.

196
00:12:24,146 --> 00:12:26,580
- Looks like it's going to get dark soon.
- Here!

197
00:12:32,487 --> 00:12:37,220
Partial print there and there,
heading off in that direction.

198
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:48,360
You know, we finally unseal a new section,

199
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:51,460
make the biggest discovery
aboard this ship since the bridge,

200
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:54,062
and now we're supposed to ignore it
because Rush says so?

201
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,539
Man wants to be cautious.

202
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,772
Since when is Rush cautious?

203
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:00,904
Well, I guess having your consciousness
trapped in a simulation will do that to you.

204
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,806
- Screw this.
- Where you going?

205
00:13:04,883 --> 00:13:09,183
To check out the stasis pods.
And don't tell on me, all right?

206
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,222
Wait for me.

207
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:17,020
- Wait, wait, wait. Where are you going?
- Relax, Corporal.

208
00:13:28,706 --> 00:13:31,037
- How does it look?
- Not good.

209
00:13:32,943 --> 00:13:35,241
That thing is still down there.

210
00:13:37,013 --> 00:13:38,913
It's guarding its lair,

211
00:13:40,317 --> 00:13:42,217
and you're in no condition
to make a run for it.

212
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,477
Look, Lieutenant, please,

213
00:13:44,553 --> 00:13:46,919
I know you'd stand a better chance
out there without me, but I need...

214
00:13:46,989 --> 00:13:49,321
Listen! I'm not leaving you behind,

215
00:13:50,192 --> 00:13:52,057
and when the time comes,
I am going to need your help.

216
00:13:52,461 --> 00:13:53,860
So I need you to calm down.

217
00:13:54,196 --> 00:13:55,857
You need to get it together, okay?

218
00:13:56,065 --> 00:13:58,123
- Can you do that?
- Yeah. Yeah.

219
00:13:59,634 --> 00:14:00,623
Okay.

220
00:14:14,681 --> 00:14:18,811
Oh, hey. I'm just on my way to the mess.
Can I get you anything?

221
00:14:18,886 --> 00:14:20,854
No, I'm good, thank you.

222
00:14:21,688 --> 00:14:22,848
Hey, how's the search going?

223
00:14:23,523 --> 00:14:26,855
I don't know. I haven't heard anything
since Varro and his team went down.

224
00:14:27,593 --> 00:14:30,153
- Let us hope that makes a difference.
- Yeah.

225
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:34,595
It's times like these that really
make you appreciate what you have,

226
00:14:35,468 --> 00:14:37,799
- who you have.
- Yeah, for sure.

227
00:14:38,904 --> 00:14:39,893
It's like...

228
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,274
Well, having Matt
has made such a difference,

229
00:14:45,243 --> 00:14:48,110
knowing he's there for me no matter what.

230
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,446
I'm really lucky to have that someone.

231
00:14:54,218 --> 00:14:55,446
So does Lisa know?

232
00:14:56,453 --> 00:14:57,579
Know what?

233
00:14:58,989 --> 00:15:00,115
How you feel about her.

234
00:15:01,225 --> 00:15:03,591
I know it's probably none of my business,

235
00:15:03,661 --> 00:15:08,120
but I saw the way
you two were together and...

236
00:15:08,197 --> 00:15:10,722
We were? No, no, no. Lisa...

237
00:15:10,934 --> 00:15:13,801
Lisa and I, we're just...
It's strictly... Professional.

238
00:15:13,937 --> 00:15:16,633
Platonic. Professionally platonic.
We're not...

239
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,666
- Oh, I'm sorry. I totally misread...
- Oh, no, no, it's a simple mistake.

240
00:15:20,742 --> 00:15:24,041
No, no, that happens,
you know, sometimes.

241
00:15:29,584 --> 00:15:30,948
So you're going to the mess hall?

242
00:15:31,018 --> 00:15:32,315
- Yes. Mmm.
- Yeah.

243
00:15:32,386 --> 00:15:35,787
- That's where I'm going.
- Okay. Thank you.

244
00:15:42,163 --> 00:15:46,292
I'm just saying, recent events
have made me put things in perspective.

245
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,959
Like, who made him de facto leader?

246
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:51,094
He did. He was lead scientist on Icarus.

247
00:15:51,171 --> 00:15:53,435
You know, I'm the one who solved
the mystery of the ninth chevron.

248
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,805
Yeah, thanks for that.

249
00:16:10,456 --> 00:16:12,685
So what are you saying?
You want to be lead scientist?

250
00:16:12,757 --> 00:16:15,749
No. I just... I think it's time

251
00:16:15,827 --> 00:16:19,228
that we all had more of a say
in the decisions that are being made.

252
00:16:19,664 --> 00:16:22,224
I'm tired of him deciding
what's best for us.

253
00:16:23,101 --> 00:16:24,931
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa! Hold on!

254
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:26,194
- Hey, hey!
- Whoa.

255
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:27,793
Thanks. Great. What did you do?

256
00:16:28,338 --> 00:16:30,738
- I didn't do anything. What did...
- You accidentally pressed something!

257
00:16:30,807 --> 00:16:32,934
- Now, hit the "open" button.
- Oh, 'cause there's a...

258
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:36,045
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

259
00:16:36,113 --> 00:16:37,602
I can't... Oh, that can't...

260
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,341
- Hey! Eli!
- Okay, hang on, hold on!

261
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,178
- Crap! I got it!
- Eli, what're you...

262
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,548
Maybe... Can we...

263
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,759
You guys do much
hunting back on Earth?

264
00:17:01,836 --> 00:17:03,531
Not unless
you count fishing.

265
00:17:04,772 --> 00:17:09,573
Well, growing up, my brother and I,
we learned from my father,

266
00:17:10,644 --> 00:17:12,111
how to hunt, kill,

267
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:15,512
but the most important things he taught us
was respect for the wild.

268
00:17:15,582 --> 00:17:19,517
There ain't nothing noble about
this thing. It's a monster.

269
00:17:19,585 --> 00:17:22,850
Yeah, but unlike us,
animals don't know hate.

270
00:17:22,922 --> 00:17:24,787
All they know is fear and hunger.

271
00:17:28,928 --> 00:17:31,691
Hey, I got something here. The tracks,

272
00:17:33,432 --> 00:17:34,524
they just stop.

273
00:17:38,437 --> 00:17:40,462
Okay. There's been a lot of movement here.

274
00:17:47,611 --> 00:17:49,374
Get down, get down!

275
00:18:22,744 --> 00:18:23,733
Stop!

276
00:18:24,745 --> 00:18:27,543
Get off me! We've got it on the run!
Now's our chance!

277
00:18:27,615 --> 00:18:28,673
The hell we do!

278
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,678
Lt'll draw you out,
separate you from the group,

279
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:32,378
then pick you off!

280
00:18:33,621 --> 00:18:36,146
What the hell do you think
happened back there?

281
00:18:36,224 --> 00:18:40,421
It led us to that spot, it waited for us.
It's smart!

282
00:18:40,794 --> 00:18:42,659
All this time we've been hunting it,

283
00:18:44,064 --> 00:18:45,998
it's been hunting us.

284
00:19:06,384 --> 00:19:08,579
- Are you ready?
- Do it!

285
00:19:15,126 --> 00:19:16,525
- Got it.
- Yeah.

286
00:19:28,872 --> 00:19:29,964
What?

287
00:19:30,207 --> 00:19:31,400
Why didn't you pull that trigger?

288
00:19:33,142 --> 00:19:37,044
There's no predicting how someone's
gonna react in a pressure situation.

289
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,547
Panic sets in. People freeze. It happens.

290
00:19:41,984 --> 00:19:43,508
But not to you.

291
00:19:45,453 --> 00:19:48,286
Something got inside your head. What?

292
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:52,056
I think I died.

293
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:02,096
After the kidney surgery,
during the recovery,

294
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:03,727
there was a point when I woke up

295
00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:06,666
to nothing.

296
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:11,600
I couldn't hear, couldn't
see, couldn't move.

297
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:17,539
I was trapped in this darkness,
you know, like nothing I have ever known.

298
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:20,950
You were scared.

299
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:23,582
That's a normal reaction.

300
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:26,917
I've done some crazy things in my day.

301
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,760
Risked my life
without even giving it a second thought.

302
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,125
No fear.

303
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:37,128
But now,

304
00:20:41,472 --> 00:20:43,565
all I know is that darkness

305
00:20:47,044 --> 00:20:50,411
and the fact
that I don't ever want to go back.

306
00:20:53,483 --> 00:20:57,249
T.J. had you under some pretty
heavy sedatives for that operation.

307
00:20:58,855 --> 00:21:01,085
They shut you down.

308
00:21:01,224 --> 00:21:03,385
Your brain was probably
the first thing to wake up,

309
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,791
and it just took the rest of your body
a little while to catch up.

310
00:21:06,095 --> 00:21:08,290
You think that's what it was?

311
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:11,988
I can't claim to know
for sure what death is,

312
00:21:12,067 --> 00:21:15,730
but I know in my heart it isn't that.

313
00:21:28,383 --> 00:21:30,044
This should do till you
get back to the ship.

314
00:21:30,118 --> 00:21:31,482
I'm not going back.

315
00:21:32,686 --> 00:21:33,880
I'm not giving up on my people.

316
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:37,352
No one's giving up.
You've just got to think this through.

317
00:21:38,859 --> 00:21:40,486
It won't take much
for those stitches to open up.

318
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,619
If you start bleeding out, then what?

319
00:21:43,563 --> 00:21:46,725
I'm sorry, but in your condition,
you're a liability to us.

320
00:21:48,301 --> 00:21:50,735
At best, you slow us down.

321
00:21:51,304 --> 00:21:52,430
At worst, you die.

322
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:59,300
I'll get her back.

323
00:21:59,811 --> 00:22:00,800
You have my word.

324
00:22:02,147 --> 00:22:04,012
We need to get moving.

325
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:09,617
We can come back, bury the bodies later.

326
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,929
You listen to me,

327
00:22:25,301 --> 00:22:26,563
you bring her back safe.

328
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:37,174
All right. Let's... Let's go.

329
00:22:47,189 --> 00:22:48,918
Hello, Eli. Come in.

330
00:22:54,228 --> 00:22:56,196
<i>- Yeah?
- Good morning.</i>

331
00:22:56,464 --> 00:22:58,056
Is Mr. Brody with you?

332
00:23:00,434 --> 00:23:01,526
Yep.

333
00:23:07,006 --> 00:23:08,132
You two are supposed to be

334
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:10,733
in the control interface room
running diagnostics. Where are you?

335
00:23:12,545 --> 00:23:14,376
We're just grabbing something to eat.

336
00:23:14,848 --> 00:23:17,248
Yeah, well, hurry up.
I know it's not the most glamorous work,

337
00:23:17,317 --> 00:23:18,340
but it needs to be done.

338
00:23:19,084 --> 00:23:21,109
We'll finish up, be on our way.

339
00:23:38,169 --> 00:23:39,158
Here?

340
00:23:40,338 --> 00:23:41,362
This is good.

341
00:23:41,873 --> 00:23:44,102
Good for what? Why are we stopping?

342
00:23:44,207 --> 00:23:46,539
We've already established
this creature is smart.

343
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,475
It sees us as a threat,
so it's stalking us,

344
00:23:49,212 --> 00:23:52,010
and sooner or later,
it's going to try to ambush us again,

345
00:23:52,082 --> 00:23:54,482
but this time, we'll be ready for him.

346
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:03,556
Here we go.

347
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,504
How we doing for time?

348
00:24:25,846 --> 00:24:28,280
<i>We've got six hours till
Destiny jumps.</i>

349
00:24:28,348 --> 00:24:30,339
They wouldn't abandon us.

350
00:24:31,018 --> 00:24:33,486
No, not unless they think we're dead.

351
00:24:36,023 --> 00:24:38,456
Which is why I really need to get
this radio working.

352
00:25:04,682 --> 00:25:06,707
Were you watching me sleep?

353
00:25:07,084 --> 00:25:10,576
No, no. No, I was just
checking to see if you were...

354
00:25:10,855 --> 00:25:12,755
If you were awake,
which you seemed not to be,

355
00:25:12,823 --> 00:25:15,587
but then now... Then you are now.

356
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:22,156
- I brought you something to eat.
- Oh, that was sweet of you.

357
00:25:22,398 --> 00:25:24,423
Dr. Park, how are you feeling?

358
00:25:24,834 --> 00:25:27,325
I'm fine. Thanks.

359
00:25:28,004 --> 00:25:29,335
How are getting on with those calculations?

360
00:25:29,706 --> 00:25:31,730
Oh, yeah, I finished them.

361
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:35,240
I can't believe this.
You're making her work? She's injured.

362
00:25:35,644 --> 00:25:38,340
Yes, her ribs, not her brain.

363
00:25:38,514 --> 00:25:40,880
Dale, I asked him
to give me something to do.

364
00:25:41,149 --> 00:25:43,174
I'm going stir-crazy just sitting here.

365
00:25:43,485 --> 00:25:46,044
Good, good. See you back on the bridge.

366
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,610
Yeah, I'm just going to finish up
with my visit and...

367
00:25:47,688 --> 00:25:49,383
Hey, take your time.

368
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,330
<i>- Anything?
Nothing.</i>

369
00:26:04,237 --> 00:26:05,363
<i>Not yet.</i>

370
00:26:12,945 --> 00:26:16,244
I got a bad feeling that this is a mistake.

371
00:26:16,782 --> 00:26:18,773
I mean, while we're sitting here,

372
00:26:18,851 --> 00:26:22,844
that thing is putting as much distance
between us as possible.

373
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:26,951
No, the creature knows we're hunting it,
so it needs to protect its lair.

374
00:26:27,025 --> 00:26:29,823
To do that,
it has to make sure we never reach it.

375
00:26:29,894 --> 00:26:30,883
Yeah.

376
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,529
Makes sense.

377
00:26:35,266 --> 00:26:37,166
You know, but if you're wrong about this,

378
00:26:38,168 --> 00:26:40,796
don't count on making it back to the ship.

379
00:26:40,871 --> 00:26:42,270
You don't think I want to save them?

380
00:26:42,673 --> 00:26:44,402
Yeah.

381
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:45,933
I'm sure you do.

382
00:26:47,344 --> 00:26:48,971
You look like you got more to say.

383
00:26:49,813 --> 00:26:52,975
Well, whatever you have in mind
for you and T.J.,

384
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:54,448
you can forget about it, you know?

385
00:26:56,118 --> 00:26:58,245
'Cause that's not happening.

386
00:26:58,454 --> 00:27:00,445
Why don't we let her decide that?

387
00:27:01,657 --> 00:27:02,817
<i>Varro.</i>

388
00:27:04,459 --> 00:27:07,895
<i>- Go ahead, Tasia. - It's on the
move, it's headed your way.</i>

389
00:27:12,934 --> 00:27:14,060
Here we go.

390
00:27:20,407 --> 00:27:21,772
Come on.

391
00:27:23,811 --> 00:27:24,869
Come on.

392
00:27:26,113 --> 00:27:27,307
I'm right here.

393
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:29,338
I'm right here!

394
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:51,893
- Did you get it?
- Oh, yeah.

395
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,170
All right. We should get moving.

396
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:56,001
In a few hours,
it's going to start to get dark...

397
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:06,115
There are more of them out there.

398
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:17,953
Following their trail's
gotten way too easy.

399
00:28:18,862 --> 00:28:21,057
It's almost as if
they're daring us to come after them.

400
00:28:21,131 --> 00:28:23,531
They're luring us in to finish us off.

401
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,499
The thing that attacked us
back at the camp

402
00:28:25,567 --> 00:28:28,468
is bigger than the ones we're tracking now.

403
00:28:28,537 --> 00:28:30,596
These tracks are smaller.
These are the babies.

404
00:28:30,673 --> 00:28:32,538
We're getting close to their lair.

405
00:28:32,675 --> 00:28:34,666
The fact that we're dealing
with more than one of these things

406
00:28:34,743 --> 00:28:37,802
reduces our chances
of finding our people alive.

407
00:28:38,246 --> 00:28:40,146
Are you saying
you're having second thoughts?

408
00:28:40,214 --> 00:28:41,806
Because, you know,
I can do this on my own.

409
00:28:41,883 --> 00:28:43,373
Oh, no, you can't.

410
00:28:43,718 --> 00:28:45,743
Hell, I don't even think
we can do this together,

411
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,254
but I'm gonna see this through.

412
00:28:49,691 --> 00:28:53,649
Besides, this close to the nest,
we're past the point of no return.

413
00:28:58,432 --> 00:29:01,492
That thing's too big, too strong.

414
00:29:03,103 --> 00:29:05,627
I can't stand the thought
of being eaten alive.

415
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:11,232
When the time comes,
if I don't have the guts to do it myself...

416
00:29:12,945 --> 00:29:14,003
What are you saying, Corporal?

417
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,077
I'm saying I don't want to die like that!

418
00:29:16,782 --> 00:29:18,772
I'd rather you finished me off first!

419
00:29:19,651 --> 00:29:22,313
Hey. Hey, you listen to me.

420
00:29:23,488 --> 00:29:25,456
Now, you have two choices.

421
00:29:26,491 --> 00:29:28,982
<i>You can suck it up
and walk back on the Destiny</i>

422
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,425
with your head held high,

423
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:34,262
or you can force me to save your sorry ass,
and live with the shame.

424
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:37,961
- Is that understood?
- Yes, ma'am.

425
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:59,076
This is...
This is Lieutenant Johansen. Over.

426
00:30:00,655 --> 00:30:01,644
Is there anyone out there?

427
00:30:03,658 --> 00:30:05,023
You remind me of someone
I used to run ops with.

428
00:30:06,261 --> 00:30:10,095
First one into a firefight,
last one to leave enemy territory.

429
00:30:10,165 --> 00:30:12,029
He was fearless.

430
00:30:12,366 --> 00:30:15,893
He ended up volunteering
for what you'd call a suicide mission.

431
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:18,700
He wasn't afraid.
Turns out, he should've been.

432
00:30:19,807 --> 00:30:20,796
He was wrong.

433
00:30:21,742 --> 00:30:24,005
In those situations, when the odds
are stacked against you

434
00:30:24,077 --> 00:30:25,738
and you're looking death in the face,

435
00:30:26,246 --> 00:30:30,580
it's fear that keeps you
and the people around you alive.

436
00:30:32,152 --> 00:30:34,313
<i>This is Lieutenant Johansen.</i>

437
00:30:36,322 --> 00:30:40,087
<i>- This is Greer. Over.
- Sergeant?</i>

438
00:30:40,492 --> 00:30:43,256
Lieutenant, what's your situation?

439
00:30:44,563 --> 00:30:50,967
Corporal Reynolds and I are in a cave
on the side of a hill overlooking a ravine.

440
00:30:51,869 --> 00:30:52,961
Somewhere north of camp.

441
00:30:53,604 --> 00:30:55,799
The creature that attacked us,
it brought us here,

442
00:30:55,873 --> 00:30:59,172
and it appears to be guarding its territory,
so approach with extreme caution.

443
00:31:00,278 --> 00:31:03,441
<i>The Corporal is injured and in
no condition to make a run for it.</i>

444
00:31:03,514 --> 00:31:07,040
Hang tight, Lieutenant.
We're coming for you.

445
00:31:09,486 --> 00:31:10,612
Copy.

446
00:31:13,089 --> 00:31:15,887
Sorry. Lost track of time.

447
00:31:18,093 --> 00:31:19,287
Yeah, well, I'm not surprised.

448
00:31:20,229 --> 00:31:21,924
You two obviously
enjoy each other's company.

449
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,767
I'm not sure if you meant anything by that,

450
00:31:25,835 --> 00:31:29,236
but you should know there's nothing
going on between me and Park.

451
00:31:31,673 --> 00:31:32,765
Of course not.

452
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:36,773
What do you mean "of course not"?
You say it like it could never happen.

453
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:38,807
Well, it couldn't.

454
00:31:39,047 --> 00:31:43,040
Okay, I get it.
Because she's so attractive and I'm not?

455
00:31:43,117 --> 00:31:45,084
No, no, no, no.

456
00:31:45,385 --> 00:31:49,082
Let's just say that
you don't seem like the romantic type.

457
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:53,648
Oh, really? Okay.
Well, then what type am I?

458
00:31:54,394 --> 00:31:56,089
The good friend type, obviously.

459
00:31:57,396 --> 00:31:58,624
The trusted confidant.

460
00:31:58,931 --> 00:32:01,229
The guy who's always there with the...

461
00:32:01,968 --> 00:32:03,560
The shoulder to cry on.

462
00:32:04,503 --> 00:32:06,528
And that's just life, I'm afraid.

463
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,170
We all have our predestined roles,

464
00:32:11,543 --> 00:32:13,568
but, you know, on the bright side,

465
00:32:13,645 --> 00:32:16,375
a life free of romantic entanglements,

466
00:32:16,448 --> 00:32:20,578
well, it certainly benefits
the pursuit of science.

467
00:32:30,628 --> 00:32:35,258
Seriously, Eli, I don't have time for this.
They need me in the infirmary.

468
00:32:35,332 --> 00:32:38,664
Colonel Young and Lieutenant James
just got back. They're injured.

469
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,960
What did you do?

470
00:32:41,371 --> 00:32:43,430
I didn't do anything.
He did this to himself.

471
00:32:43,506 --> 00:32:46,236
- He was just in there pushing buttons...
- Is he okay?

472
00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:48,641
Yes, according to the monitoring system,
he's fine.

473
00:32:48,711 --> 00:32:50,372
Just frozen.

474
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,743
- Did you tell Rush?
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

475
00:32:52,814 --> 00:32:55,806
And we're not going to. Not yet, anyway.

476
00:32:55,884 --> 00:32:58,250
Just for once I'd like to solve a problem
without his help.

477
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,912
Eli, you have to get him out of there.

478
00:32:59,988 --> 00:33:01,421
I know, which is why you're here.

479
00:33:02,424 --> 00:33:06,086
You still have some of that
residual alien knowledge, right?

480
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,720
- Eli...
- Just do me a favor.

481
00:33:08,963 --> 00:33:11,932
Take a look.
See if anything jumps out at you?

482
00:33:15,269 --> 00:33:16,258
Um...

483
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:21,898
That's got to be it.

484
00:33:38,123 --> 00:33:42,150
I'll go first, scout out the area.
If it's clear, I'll radio back.

485
00:33:43,195 --> 00:33:45,162
I don't think so.

486
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:50,498
If you got something to say, say it.

487
00:33:51,135 --> 00:33:52,193
I don't think you're up for this.

488
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:55,130
- You calling me a coward?
- No, you're not a coward,

489
00:33:55,239 --> 00:33:57,297
but you're second-guessing yourself,
and that's a problem.

490
00:33:57,574 --> 00:33:58,598
We don't have time for you

491
00:33:58,675 --> 00:34:00,370
to sort through whatever issues
you're dealing with.

492
00:34:00,811 --> 00:34:04,907
- So I'm going.
- No, I'm going.

493
00:34:09,886 --> 00:34:15,118
But I'm going to need you
to create a little diversion for me.

494
00:34:17,059 --> 00:34:19,823
We're going to be okay.
They're almost here.

495
00:34:42,049 --> 00:34:44,483
- You ready, Corporal?
- Yes, ma'am.

496
00:34:44,551 --> 00:34:46,075
Aim for its eyes.

497
00:35:32,729 --> 00:35:33,718
Lieutenant!

498
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:37,690
- Don't shoot!
- What?

499
00:35:38,268 --> 00:35:39,565
I don't think it wants to hurt us.

500
00:35:39,869 --> 00:35:42,360
- I've got the shot, ma'am.
- No, the fire.

501
00:35:42,672 --> 00:35:44,036
It recognizes intelligence.

502
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:45,829
Didn't stop it from trying to kill us.

503
00:35:46,108 --> 00:35:48,042
That's because you were a threat to it
and its family.

504
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:50,135
It recognizes a threat and goes after it.

505
00:35:50,479 --> 00:35:53,380
That's what I was counting on out there
to buy us some time

506
00:35:53,715 --> 00:35:58,208
so I suggest that you start moving.

507
00:36:02,256 --> 00:36:03,416
Slowly.

508
00:36:04,358 --> 00:36:05,347
Let's go.

509
00:36:14,534 --> 00:36:15,865
It's intelligent.

510
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:19,805
Smart enough to know
that I can cause it a world of hurt,

511
00:36:20,474 --> 00:36:22,237
maybe even kill it,

512
00:36:22,309 --> 00:36:27,940
and smart enough to know
that I'm choosing

513
00:36:30,349 --> 00:36:31,338
not to.

514
00:37:00,043 --> 00:37:01,476
Let's go.

515
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,346
No.

516
00:37:23,899 --> 00:37:25,730
- So?
- I don't know, I'm not seeing...

517
00:37:29,804 --> 00:37:31,634
doing?

518
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:37,238
What the hell?

519
00:37:48,922 --> 00:37:50,184
That's that, then.

520
00:37:50,623 --> 00:37:51,749
What's what?

521
00:37:51,891 --> 00:37:56,328
I've just completed a thorough diagnostic
of one of the stasis pods.

522
00:37:58,530 --> 00:37:59,792
Very informative.

523
00:38:15,947 --> 00:38:17,278
How many of those things you take down?

524
00:38:18,649 --> 00:38:21,641
About none, but I managed to lose them

525
00:38:23,087 --> 00:38:24,314
and circle back.

526
00:38:26,389 --> 00:38:28,380
I feel like I could sleep for a week.

527
00:38:30,327 --> 00:38:32,522
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

528
00:39:00,054 --> 00:39:02,045
Congratulations, I hear you're a free man.

529
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:08,583
Apparently, someone put in a good
word for me with Colonel Young.

530
00:39:08,662 --> 00:39:11,392
As much as I'd like to take credit,
I really haven't had any time.

531
00:39:11,465 --> 00:39:14,593
- I know. It was Sergeant Greer.
- Greer?

532
00:39:14,668 --> 00:39:15,657
Mmm-hmm.

533
00:39:16,303 --> 00:39:18,202
I'd love to thank him,

534
00:39:19,572 --> 00:39:22,370
but I get the feeling he'll claim
he doesn't know what I'm talking about.

535
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:24,103
Yeah, probably.

536
00:39:26,912 --> 00:39:30,972
Listen, I just wanted to come by
and say I'm sorry about your people,

537
00:39:32,817 --> 00:39:35,012
and even though you may feel
like you're alone,

538
00:39:36,788 --> 00:39:37,948
you're not.

539
00:39:39,958 --> 00:39:41,289
I know.

540
00:40:03,646 --> 00:40:04,874
Come in.

541
00:40:08,351 --> 00:40:11,547
You had said you wanted to
lend your expertise to tonight's dinner.

542
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,053
Becker's ready.

543
00:40:27,001 --> 00:40:28,400
You... You okay?

544
00:40:30,538 --> 00:40:31,766
I'm good.

545
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,768
Good.

546
00:40:59,131 --> 00:41:01,793
That completes this round of diagnostics.

547
00:41:02,634 --> 00:41:05,067
Now we can move on to the fun part.

548
00:41:05,136 --> 00:41:06,330
Fun part?
- Yeah, well,

549
00:41:06,404 --> 00:41:08,395
it's time to go and check out
the stasis chambers now.

550
00:41:08,473 --> 00:41:11,101
Whoa, whoa, not so fast.

551
00:41:12,243 --> 00:41:14,302
Let's finish going through the data
on that section

552
00:41:14,379 --> 00:41:17,041
before we start heading in there
and pushing buttons.

553
00:41:18,215 --> 00:41:21,275
Yeah, of course, you're right.
Proceed with caution.

554
00:41:41,937 --> 00:41:43,063
And what else?

555
00:41:49,411 --> 00:41:51,777
- God, that's a good question.
- Yeah.

556
00:43:29,203 --> 00:43:30,192
English - US - SDH
