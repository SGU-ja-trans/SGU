1
00:00:02,134 --> 00:00:05,592
<i>This is what Destiny intended from
the moment it entered the star system.</i>

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,935
<i>That ship is the best chance
we have of getting home.</i>

3
00:00:09,007 --> 00:00:11,475
- Are we done?
- We'll never be done.

4
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:14,069
<i>You shouldn't have
left him on the planet.</i>

5
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:15,704
<i>You think I don't know that?</i>

6
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:19,677
<i>Everyone thinks we're safe.
They think that they'll never find us again.</i>

7
00:00:19,751 --> 00:00:21,548
Why did you take
one of our people prisoner?

8
00:00:23,255 --> 00:00:24,654
<i>We're not safe, are we?</i>

9
00:00:24,723 --> 00:00:26,554
They're coming!
- Who's coming?

10
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,354
<i>Lucian Alliance,
they're coming to take Destiny.</i>

11
00:00:28,493 --> 00:00:30,358
<i>There's only one way
this is gonna end if we wait.</i>

12
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:31,828
<i>I'm not
surrendering this ship.</i>

13
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,294
This planet was created for us.
We were led here for a reason.

14
00:00:36,368 --> 00:00:37,834
Some of the people have decided

15
00:00:37,902 --> 00:00:39,767
that they would like to stay behind
on the planet.

16
00:00:39,837 --> 00:00:43,273
<i>Colonel Telford admitted to being
a mole for the Lucian Alliance.</i>

17
00:00:43,374 --> 00:00:44,739
<i>We're going to have to do this
the hard way.</i>

18
00:00:46,043 --> 00:00:49,137
<i>I'm going to save
every one of those hostages</i>

19
00:00:49,213 --> 00:00:51,113
and I'm going to retake this ship.

20
00:00:53,184 --> 00:00:54,811
What happened?
- You were shot.

21
00:00:54,885 --> 00:00:57,945
There's no countdown. We dropped
out of FTL because someone was gating in.

22
00:00:58,022 --> 00:00:59,046
Why haven't we jumped back?

23
00:00:59,123 --> 00:01:01,614
<i>The Destiny came out of FTL
within range of a pulsar.</i>

24
00:01:01,692 --> 00:01:03,023
We don't have much time
before the shield fails.

25
00:01:03,094 --> 00:01:04,789
<i>Look, someone's going to
have to go for a walk.</i>

26
00:01:04,862 --> 00:01:07,330
<i>It should buy us enough time
to restore FTL capability.</i>

27
00:01:07,398 --> 00:01:09,332
Transfer control of the ship
and surrender yourselves.

28
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,768
<i>They'll herd all of the prisoners
into one compartment.</i>

29
00:01:11,836 --> 00:01:13,394
<i>I'll access one of the
Gate Room consoles</i>

30
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:15,496
<i>and transfer control of the ship
back to Rush.</i>

31
00:01:17,174 --> 00:01:19,233
<i>Kiva and Telford
have both been shot.</i>

32
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,006
<i>The shield is still up!
We cannot get back inside!</i>

33
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:24,138
<i>I need you to head back
towards the front of the ship.</i>

34
00:01:24,215 --> 00:01:26,740
<i>- That's the way in.
- I'm getting a message. I gotta go.</i>

35
00:02:35,418 --> 00:02:37,215
Beautiful, isn't she?

36
00:02:40,156 --> 00:02:41,248
Caine?

37
00:02:41,524 --> 00:02:43,424
It's good to see you again, T.J.

38
00:02:44,627 --> 00:02:46,424
What... What is this?

39
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,425
Where am I? How did I get here?

40
00:02:49,499 --> 00:02:55,562
I know it's a lot to process right now,
so just take your time, okay?

41
00:02:56,271 --> 00:02:58,762
We left you on that planet,
and we left the galaxy.

42
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,502
You can't be surprised
that aliens who built a solar system

43
00:03:01,577 --> 00:03:05,104
are capable of
a little intergalactic transport.

44
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:09,610
- Are you saying they brought me here?
- Well, you're here, right?

45
00:03:11,286 --> 00:03:13,584
- So this is...
- Your baby, of course.

46
00:03:14,456 --> 00:03:18,688
You don't have to worry anymore, T.J.
She's safe now.

47
00:03:59,201 --> 00:04:01,431
- We're getting a message.
- It's Eli.

48
00:04:08,442 --> 00:04:09,568
They didn't make it.

49
00:04:17,652 --> 00:04:19,415
There just wasn't enough time.

50
00:04:21,255 --> 00:04:23,348
<i>This is Scott!
Come in, please!</i>

51
00:04:28,296 --> 00:04:29,558
Lieutenant, where are you?

52
00:04:29,697 --> 00:04:31,824
<i>Well, we're still outside.</i>

53
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:34,459
<i>I had a hunch we weren't going to
make it to the airlock in time,</i>

54
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:37,800
<i>so we made a beeline
for the underside of the ship.</i>

55
00:04:38,606 --> 00:04:41,131
<i>I'm guessing the hull protected us.</i>

56
00:04:43,611 --> 00:04:45,135
I guess it did.

57
00:04:45,546 --> 00:04:46,877
Well, the radiation spike has passed.

58
00:04:46,947 --> 00:04:49,415
You should be safe
to make it to the airlock now.

59
00:04:49,483 --> 00:04:51,678
<i>Roger that. We're on our way.</i>

60
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,834
Just another day in outer space.

61
00:05:15,008 --> 00:05:16,407
Dannic!

62
00:05:16,476 --> 00:05:18,501
The military personnel are a liability.

63
00:05:18,578 --> 00:05:20,671
Kiva's still alive.
The medic's been injured. She was shot.

64
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:25,214
She was military as well.
It was a mistake to trust her.

65
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:40,165
- You son of a... Son of a...
- I want him dead! I want him dead.

66
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:44,397
Dannic, listen to me! Listen to me!
We need their cooperation.

67
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:47,872
We can use the communication stones
to get a team of doctors onboard.

68
00:05:47,941 --> 00:05:50,239
- We can't spare the men.
We can use some of them.

69
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,675
It doesn't matter what they report back.

70
00:05:51,745 --> 00:05:53,610
There's nothing anyone on Earth can do
about this.

71
00:05:55,081 --> 00:05:57,948
All right. But if Kiva dies, they all die.

72
00:06:16,603 --> 00:06:18,867
Thank God.
I thought you two were fried for sure.

73
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,905
No, we're fine.
I'd say we're anything but fine.

74
00:06:21,974 --> 00:06:24,602
Yeah? You'd rather be back out there?

75
00:06:25,077 --> 00:06:26,476
Eli?

76
00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:30,010
- Chloe?
- Hey, what happened?

77
00:06:30,616 --> 00:06:32,811
- She was shot in the leg.
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

78
00:06:32,885 --> 00:06:33,977
How are you even walking right now?

79
00:06:34,052 --> 00:06:35,849
Ten minutes ago,
you were almost passed out.

80
00:06:35,921 --> 00:06:38,890
I don't know, the bleeding stopped.
I got my strength back.

81
00:06:39,391 --> 00:06:41,086
- What?
Yeah.

82
00:06:47,232 --> 00:06:48,995
She's right. The bleeding's stopped.

83
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:50,898
Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

84
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:53,998
Everybody's fine.

85
00:06:55,974 --> 00:06:57,134
So?

86
00:06:58,477 --> 00:06:59,637
What do we do now?

87
00:07:09,521 --> 00:07:11,216
Who are you?

88
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:15,520
Um... I'm Dr. Brightman.

89
00:07:15,594 --> 00:07:20,998
This is Dr. Ziegler, Dr.
Finch and Dr. Tyman.

90
00:07:23,502 --> 00:07:25,299
All right, follow me.

91
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,876
What now?

92
00:07:40,618 --> 00:07:42,609
Looks like it's working.

93
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:46,014
What are you talking about?

94
00:07:47,658 --> 00:07:49,285
The countdown clock?

95
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,421
With all the shield strength concentrated
in the direction of the pulsar,

96
00:07:53,498 --> 00:07:57,093
the engines are protected enough
to generate an FTL jump.

97
00:07:57,168 --> 00:07:58,465
Yeah, but that's a good thing, right?

98
00:07:58,536 --> 00:08:00,834
I mean, this whole area of space
is a dead zone.

99
00:08:01,172 --> 00:08:04,005
The sooner we get out of here, the better.

100
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,780
All right, we're close enough.
You two meet up with Rush and Brody...

101
00:08:16,854 --> 00:08:17,843
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

102
00:08:17,922 --> 00:08:19,480
They would've figured out
who's missing by now.

103
00:08:19,557 --> 00:08:20,581
They will be looking, so be careful.

104
00:08:20,658 --> 00:08:21,852
- Where are you going?
- Recon.

105
00:08:21,926 --> 00:08:23,325
- We need to find out what's happening.
- Scott...

106
00:08:23,394 --> 00:08:25,453
Eli, just go.

107
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,533
Yeah, I need some help over here.

108
00:08:33,037 --> 00:08:34,698
Is he going to make it?

109
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,999
Yeah, he'll be fine.
The bullet passed clean through.

110
00:08:37,073 --> 00:08:38,802
Let me know when he wakes up.
I want to talk to him.

111
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,672
Listen, your commander wasn't so lucky.

112
00:08:40,944 --> 00:08:44,107
Dr. Finch is working on her right now,
but it isn't looking good.

113
00:08:44,347 --> 00:08:46,372
We think the bullet may have lodged
in her liver.

114
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:49,816
It would be in everyone's best interest
if she survived.

115
00:08:49,886 --> 00:08:51,012
Yeah, I get that.

116
00:08:52,956 --> 00:08:55,254
What about Lieutenant Johansen?

117
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,151
Well, we've managed to stem the bleeding,

118
00:08:57,227 --> 00:08:59,491
but the baby's heart rate
is dangerously low.

119
00:08:59,563 --> 00:09:02,396
We may have to take it out prematurely.

120
00:09:02,465 --> 00:09:05,366
Right now, there's no guarantee
that either one of them will survive.

121
00:09:06,002 --> 00:09:07,333
Excuse me.

122
00:09:30,927 --> 00:09:33,122
How about some coffee?

123
00:09:33,964 --> 00:09:35,488
Sure.

124
00:09:38,702 --> 00:09:41,193
Where did all this stuff come from?

125
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:43,028
There's no way you could have made it all.

126
00:09:43,173 --> 00:09:44,901
You got that right.

127
00:09:45,407 --> 00:09:48,706
We were still working on lean-to's
with dirt floors,

128
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,541
and the winter was coming.

129
00:09:51,614 --> 00:09:54,208
Frankly, I was getting a bit worried.

130
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:57,317
And then one day, on a scout, we found 'em.

131
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,878
Half a dozen just like this,
scattered over the valley.

132
00:10:02,524 --> 00:10:05,687
We did an aerial survey.
We would have seen them.

133
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:08,121
I know.

134
00:10:08,864 --> 00:10:12,925
So they just appear out of nowhere
and that's good enough for you?

135
00:10:13,068 --> 00:10:16,560
Well, I don't think we would have
survived the winter without them,

136
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,869
and that's good enough for me.

137
00:10:22,878 --> 00:10:25,676
- So why did they bring me here?
- The ship was under attack, right?

138
00:10:26,315 --> 00:10:28,840
- How did you know that?
- You were wounded.

139
00:10:29,018 --> 00:10:32,579
A lot of people were wounded,
why would I be singled out?

140
00:10:33,756 --> 00:10:37,089
They were scanning us
the minute we set foot on this planet.

141
00:10:37,593 --> 00:10:40,084
They knew everything
there is to know about us.

142
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:42,028
They knew you were pregnant.

143
00:10:45,401 --> 00:10:48,598
- What are you saying?
- You were bleeding out on the table.

144
00:10:48,804 --> 00:10:52,103
This was the only way,
or your baby would have died.

145
00:10:59,881 --> 00:11:01,109
Report.

146
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:02,843
The countdown clock has started again.

147
00:11:02,917 --> 00:11:05,249
It's probably a result of the adjustments
made to the shield.

148
00:11:05,453 --> 00:11:08,217
- How long till we jump?
- Just under 30 minutes.

149
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:11,224
<i>General, this is Dr. Brightman.</i>

150
00:11:12,827 --> 00:11:13,953
Go ahead.

151
00:11:15,363 --> 00:11:17,558
I'm sorry to have to tell you this,
but we did all we could.

152
00:11:17,632 --> 00:11:19,361
It just wasn't enough.

153
00:11:20,001 --> 00:11:22,492
<i>Your commander is dead.</i>

154
00:11:40,888 --> 00:11:42,651
Down here, this way.

155
00:11:54,068 --> 00:11:55,660
We need weapons.

156
00:11:56,137 --> 00:11:58,970
There's something else we need even more.

157
00:12:28,668 --> 00:12:29,862
You guys are back.

158
00:12:29,936 --> 00:12:33,531
You know,
this ship is really, really, really big.

159
00:12:34,374 --> 00:12:35,705
Whoa, what's that?
What happened?

160
00:12:35,776 --> 00:12:38,370
Oh, nothing we need to worry about
right now.

161
00:12:38,445 --> 00:12:41,141
What are we doing to get the ship back?

162
00:12:42,482 --> 00:12:44,507
- What?
- It's his idea.

163
00:12:44,584 --> 00:12:49,419
Colonel Telford's efforts to
divert control were not entirely in vain.

164
00:12:49,523 --> 00:12:52,549
We still have a limited ability
to manipulate power distribution,

165
00:12:52,793 --> 00:12:57,594
so I've begun a slow process of
sequestering power away from the shields.

166
00:12:58,431 --> 00:13:03,164
The same shields that are protecting us
from the deadly pulsar radiation?

167
00:13:03,603 --> 00:13:05,594
- That's right.
Like I said, his idea.

168
00:13:05,672 --> 00:13:09,164
Well, if I don't do it,
the ship's going to jump.

169
00:13:09,242 --> 00:13:11,709
- Good.
- No, no, no, Eli. You don't understand.

170
00:13:11,777 --> 00:13:14,905
You see, that pulsar
levels the playing field.

171
00:13:15,247 --> 00:13:17,772
It's just as deadly to them as it is to us.

172
00:13:18,384 --> 00:13:22,684
Once they realize what's happening
they'll have no option but to deal.

173
00:13:23,622 --> 00:13:25,249
We need to kill them all.

174
00:13:25,324 --> 00:13:27,315
The original plan
was to keep some of the scientists

175
00:13:27,393 --> 00:13:28,860
and drop the rest on a habitable planet.

176
00:13:28,928 --> 00:13:31,021
The original plan
didn't involve Kiva being killed.

177
00:13:32,731 --> 00:13:35,996
I admit it may have been optimistic
to expect any of them to work with us,

178
00:13:36,068 --> 00:13:38,468
but going on a bloody rampage now
isn't going to solve anything.

179
00:13:38,537 --> 00:13:40,334
You got another idea?

180
00:13:42,074 --> 00:13:43,439
Tell them.

181
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:45,943
We found one address we can dial
from this position.

182
00:13:46,011 --> 00:13:49,970
It's currently locked out, probably because
it's at the extreme range of the gate.

183
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:52,074
But I can get around that.

184
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:55,015
We check it out.
If it's viable, we send them.

185
00:13:55,087 --> 00:13:58,853
Everyone except the doctors.
They're still working on some of our men.

186
00:14:00,226 --> 00:14:02,285
And Lieutenant Johansen.

187
00:14:05,164 --> 00:14:06,927
She could prove to be useful down the road,

188
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:09,024
and moving her now
would be as good as killing her.

189
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:11,695
What about Rush
and the others that are still missing?

190
00:14:11,904 --> 00:14:14,498
<i>Search parties
will find them.</i>

191
00:14:23,414 --> 00:14:25,882
- We got to tell the others.
- Yeah.

192
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:33,989
You never did answer my question.

193
00:14:34,192 --> 00:14:36,183
How do you know
what's happening on the ship?

194
00:14:36,327 --> 00:14:39,421
I just do.
It's kind of hard to explain.

195
00:14:39,964 --> 00:14:41,727
The aliens told you?

196
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:44,794
Well, not face to face.

197
00:14:53,411 --> 00:14:54,469
Hey, come on in.

198
00:14:54,545 --> 00:14:57,946
- Hi! Oh, it's getting cold out there.
Right.

199
00:14:59,484 --> 00:15:00,712
Dana, Peter?

200
00:15:01,452 --> 00:15:05,752
T.J. Oh, my God! It's good to see you.

201
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,624
- How are you? Oh!
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

202
00:15:08,693 --> 00:15:10,160
How are you? How are all of you?

203
00:15:10,228 --> 00:15:12,890
We're good, T.J. We're good.
We're surviving.

204
00:15:12,964 --> 00:15:15,990
The others will be along soon.
Word's getting around.

205
00:15:16,067 --> 00:15:18,001
We were hoping we could see the baby.

206
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,295
Sure. Yeah, she's sleeping...

207
00:15:21,372 --> 00:15:22,964
Don't worry, we'll be really quiet.

208
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,168
Okay. Okay.
- Okay?

209
00:15:32,783 --> 00:15:36,947
It's big news around here.
You want to take a walk?

210
00:15:38,488 --> 00:15:41,321
- It's getting kind of dark, isn't it?
- It'll be fine.

211
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:43,188
They can look after the baby.

212
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,955
There's something I want to show you.

213
00:15:51,902 --> 00:15:53,233
He's back.

214
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,068
Simeon.

215
00:16:03,647 --> 00:16:05,308
Hurts, doesn't it?

216
00:16:11,154 --> 00:16:12,678
What happened?

217
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,689
I was hoping you could tell me.

218
00:16:20,931 --> 00:16:22,523
- Where's Kiva?
- Dead.

219
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:25,330
She was shot, just like you.

220
00:16:25,802 --> 00:16:28,362
But we're a little unclear on the details.

221
00:16:34,044 --> 00:16:36,477
We were in the Gate Room.
We were attacked.

222
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:39,207
- They came out of nowhere.
- They? There was more than one?

223
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:41,940
I'm not sure.

224
00:16:42,018 --> 00:16:43,883
- Did you see them?
- No.

225
00:16:46,455 --> 00:16:47,854
Interesting.

226
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:51,652
Because you weren't shot from behind.

227
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,523
It was dark, it happened fast.

228
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,003
I saw Kiva get shot.
I turned, everything went black.

229
00:17:07,576 --> 00:17:09,271
What's going on with the ship?
What's the situation?

230
00:17:09,345 --> 00:17:10,505
The ship is ours.

231
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,872
The shields are repaired. It's over.

232
00:17:16,152 --> 00:17:18,052
What about Colonel Young and his crew?

233
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:23,152
We won't have to worry about them
too much longer.

234
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,794
We've found a planet
with a breathable atmosphere.

235
00:17:29,865 --> 00:17:31,924
We're putting you and your people
off the ship.

236
00:17:34,437 --> 00:17:37,736
There is no way you've had enough time
to determine long-term viability.

237
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:39,606
There's not a lot of options here.

238
00:17:39,675 --> 00:17:42,667
- It's a death sentence.
- Not necessarily.

239
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,744
Now you're thinking
you've got nothing to lose.

240
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:54,644
You could jump me, take my gun,
kill the guard outside.

241
00:17:54,722 --> 00:17:56,815
But how far do you really think you'd get?

242
00:17:57,392 --> 00:18:00,361
You'd be shot, and your people
would still be sent to the planet,

243
00:18:00,428 --> 00:18:02,419
only without their leader.

244
00:18:02,497 --> 00:18:05,398
For their sake, I recommend you stay alive.

245
00:19:09,663 --> 00:19:12,928
- Hey, Sergeant, how you feeling?
- I'll be all right, sir.

246
00:19:13,367 --> 00:19:15,392
Nice place.

247
00:19:15,469 --> 00:19:16,959
Looks like a storm's coming.

248
00:19:23,277 --> 00:19:25,575
We need to find shelter, fast.

249
00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:30,949
Where the hell are Scott and Greer?

250
00:19:31,818 --> 00:19:33,217
They should have been back by now.

251
00:19:33,287 --> 00:19:36,518
- You have to calm down, Eli.
- Splitting up never works.

252
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,716
Everyone knows this.

253
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,031
It's got to be them.

254
00:19:55,809 --> 00:19:57,504
No. No, not them.

255
00:19:58,011 --> 00:20:00,343
Back away from the consoles.

256
00:20:00,414 --> 00:20:01,641
Dannic, come in.

257
00:20:02,915 --> 00:20:04,007
Go ahead.

258
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,778
<i>We got Rush and three others.</i>

259
00:20:05,851 --> 00:20:06,977
Well done.

260
00:20:09,889 --> 00:20:12,187
- What happened?
- I'm not sure.

261
00:20:13,526 --> 00:20:16,324
- The countdown stopped.
Well, start it again.

262
00:20:18,264 --> 00:20:20,289
- I can't.
- Stand by.

263
00:20:20,366 --> 00:20:22,732
The radiation
must be affecting the engines again.

264
00:20:24,103 --> 00:20:25,730
You said the shield would prevent that.

265
00:20:25,805 --> 00:20:28,000
It should. I don't understand it.

266
00:20:28,975 --> 00:20:30,875
Then what good are you?

267
00:20:31,744 --> 00:20:34,941
Dannic! Dannic!

268
00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:43,985
Bring Rush to the gate room.
I have some questions for him.

269
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:47,523
<i>- What about the others?
Kill them.</i>

270
00:20:52,665 --> 00:20:54,030
You don't want to kill anyone.

271
00:21:08,648 --> 00:21:11,138
You okay? Is everybody okay?

272
00:21:13,184 --> 00:21:14,446
Dannic, this is Rush.

273
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:19,246
<i>I'm sorry to say your men
were unable to carry out their orders.</i>

274
00:21:19,691 --> 00:21:22,251
Anyway, by now you'll have noticed
that the countdown has stopped.

275
00:21:22,761 --> 00:21:24,626
<i>That's because I've been draining
power from the shields,</i>

276
00:21:24,696 --> 00:21:28,792
and I will continue to do so
until your men lay down their weapons.

277
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:31,694
You and your people would die
with the rest of us.

278
00:21:32,704 --> 00:21:35,070
We're willing to die
to prevent you taking over this ship.

279
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,971
Can you say the same?

280
00:21:46,618 --> 00:21:48,051
Find them.

281
00:21:50,288 --> 00:21:52,085
Dannic, listen to me.

282
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,358
Don't do this.
This is your fault.

283
00:21:56,161 --> 00:21:59,255
If you had listened to me from the
beginning we wouldn't be in this position.

284
00:21:59,331 --> 00:22:00,923
Take his weapon.

285
00:22:03,101 --> 00:22:06,628
There can only be one commander,
and Kiva's dead.

286
00:22:07,972 --> 00:22:09,496
Any objections?

287
00:22:16,081 --> 00:22:18,878
What do we know about the planet?
- Not much.

288
00:22:19,016 --> 00:22:22,213
Presumably, it has breathable atmosphere,
other than that...

289
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:24,284
We have to do something.
Amen.

290
00:22:24,355 --> 00:22:28,086
No, no, this is perfect.
It couldn't have worked out better.

291
00:22:28,392 --> 00:22:30,952
- They're gonna be stranded down there.
- No, no, the ship won't jump.

292
00:22:31,095 --> 00:22:35,361
We can pick them back up later.
Plus, the planet is out of range of the pulsar.

293
00:22:35,432 --> 00:22:37,730
Believe me, they're better off.

294
00:22:38,736 --> 00:22:40,533
What does that say for the rest of us?

295
00:22:40,604 --> 00:22:42,299
We've done some calculations,

296
00:22:42,406 --> 00:22:44,533
certain areas of the ship
are better protected than others

297
00:22:44,608 --> 00:22:47,805
because of their location within the hull.
Hydroponics, for one.

298
00:22:48,011 --> 00:22:50,445
We go there, seal ourselves in,
we might be able to outlast them.

299
00:22:50,581 --> 00:22:52,674
What about the damage
to the ship itself?

300
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,809
Without the shields, the
next pulsar blast...

301
00:22:54,885 --> 00:22:58,981
Damage will be minimal.
Organic matter will suffer the most.

302
00:22:59,056 --> 00:23:01,490
Wait a minute,
not everyone's been sent off the ship.

303
00:23:01,692 --> 00:23:03,887
He mentioned something about T.J.

304
00:23:03,961 --> 00:23:06,725
It sounded like she'd been injured
and something about doctors?

305
00:23:06,797 --> 00:23:08,025
They might have used some of our people

306
00:23:08,098 --> 00:23:10,498
to get extra medical personnel on board
with the stones.

307
00:23:10,567 --> 00:23:14,867
Well, we can't just leave them out there.
Not if we're going to go through with this.

308
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:16,972
All right, Greer and I will go get them.

309
00:23:17,775 --> 00:23:20,710
Give us 15 minutes to meet you back
in hydroponics.

310
00:23:21,445 --> 00:23:24,414
After that, seal the door.

311
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,314
Colonel!

312
00:23:35,858 --> 00:23:40,192
We found a system of small caves
just over that ridge about two klicks!

313
00:23:40,363 --> 00:23:44,026
Should be enough to shelter everyone
if we break into smaller groups!

314
00:23:45,568 --> 00:23:47,559
Whoa, did you see that!
Look at that! Look at that!

315
00:23:47,637 --> 00:23:49,070
That's good enough!

316
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:54,138
Guys, guys, back up.

317
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,125
Dannic's taken control.
These men were loyal to me.

318
00:24:15,331 --> 00:24:17,526
All right, people, listen up!

319
00:24:17,934 --> 00:24:21,665
We're going to move out, but stay together.
Let's go!

320
00:24:25,975 --> 00:24:28,205
- Colonel!
- I've nothing to say to you.

321
00:24:28,344 --> 00:24:30,972
We're here because I stood up for you!

322
00:24:31,447 --> 00:24:33,642
He would have killed you all!

323
00:24:50,232 --> 00:24:51,995
Wait, Camile? What are you doing here?

324
00:24:53,268 --> 00:24:56,533
They used some of us
to connect with a team of doctors.

325
00:24:56,605 --> 00:24:58,835
Me, Volker, Kemp and Rieder.

326
00:24:59,274 --> 00:25:01,538
- All right, where are the others?
I don't know.

327
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,201
There were more injured, and...

328
00:25:05,146 --> 00:25:08,240
- Anyway, they severed the connection...
- Lieutenant...

329
00:25:16,424 --> 00:25:17,686
What happened?

330
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:21,458
She was shot. She's going to make it.

331
00:25:22,831 --> 00:25:24,594
What about the baby?

332
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:32,198
Camile, what about the baby?

333
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:49,189
- Where are you taking me?
- It's just over here. You'll get a better view.

334
00:25:54,828 --> 00:25:58,423
- Oh, my God. That's beautiful.
Yeah.

335
00:26:01,068 --> 00:26:02,535
That wasn't here.

336
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:05,731
No, it showed up last night
just before you did.

337
00:26:05,806 --> 00:26:07,467
Any idea what it means?

338
00:26:09,043 --> 00:26:10,203
Not a clue.

339
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:16,041
- Listen, I wanted to thank you.
- What for?

340
00:26:16,383 --> 00:26:19,250
Well, if you hadn't decided
to go back with Colonel Young,

341
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,015
he would have taken all of us.

342
00:26:21,422 --> 00:26:23,822
I know what a sacrifice that was.

343
00:26:24,725 --> 00:26:25,817
And the aliens knew.

344
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,927
I think that's why they were willing
to bring your daughter here.

345
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:31,791
But...

346
00:26:33,067 --> 00:26:34,125
But what?

347
00:26:34,835 --> 00:26:36,928
Well, you made your choice.

348
00:26:38,272 --> 00:26:39,603
What are you talking about?

349
00:26:40,341 --> 00:26:41,569
The baby can stay.

350
00:26:42,776 --> 00:26:46,371
We'll take care of her, I promise you,
but you have to go back.

351
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:48,949
- No.
- I'm sorry.

352
00:26:50,184 --> 00:26:52,015
- No, no, no!
- T. J!

353
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,945
Let's get her out of here.

354
00:26:56,322 --> 00:26:59,416
This way!
- We've got company.

355
00:26:59,892 --> 00:27:01,018
Take cover.

356
00:27:21,347 --> 00:27:23,372
Is that really necessary?

357
00:27:24,617 --> 00:27:26,209
Well, they're gonna figure out
where we are sooner or later.

358
00:27:26,486 --> 00:27:28,681
Even if they can't get in,
they can still vent the atmosphere.

359
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:31,414
And don't worry,
the plants are producing oxygen.

360
00:27:31,491 --> 00:27:33,356
We'll have enough breathable air.

361
00:27:33,426 --> 00:27:35,360
- For a while, anyway.
- That's 15 minutes.

362
00:27:35,428 --> 00:27:37,953
No, you have to
give them more time.

363
00:27:38,097 --> 00:27:41,089
The longer we wait,
the greater the chance of being discovered.

364
00:27:41,167 --> 00:27:44,625
- Eli!
- We can give them a few more minutes.

365
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:46,501
This is our only chance.

366
00:27:46,572 --> 00:27:48,870
If we fail and they take the ship,
we're as good as dead.

367
00:27:48,941 --> 00:27:50,932
Mr. Brody, seal the door.

368
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:08,387
The next pulsar blast will be deadly
to anybody outside this room.

369
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,291
That's the whole point, isn't it?

370
00:28:13,198 --> 00:28:14,426
Damn it!

371
00:28:15,167 --> 00:28:17,158
Sergeant! I'm moving!

372
00:28:19,905 --> 00:28:21,839
Rush, this is Scott, come in, please.

373
00:28:23,341 --> 00:28:25,036
Scott, this is Eli.

374
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,600
<i>Where are you?</i>

375
00:28:26,678 --> 00:28:29,476
<i>We are cut off.
We can't shoot our way through.</i>

376
00:28:29,548 --> 00:28:31,482
<i>Well, we haven't sealed the door yet.
There's still time.</i>

377
00:28:32,117 --> 00:28:33,744
We'll dial up the shields
until you get back.

378
00:28:33,885 --> 00:28:37,582
That'll just give them more time to find you.
Our only chance is to stick with the plan.

379
00:28:37,656 --> 00:28:39,146
Seal the door.

380
00:28:42,094 --> 00:28:43,254
Do it.

381
00:28:54,106 --> 00:28:55,198
T. J?

382
00:28:56,007 --> 00:28:58,066
- What have you done with her?
We haven't done anything.

383
00:29:22,133 --> 00:29:24,260
I'm not leaving without her.

384
00:29:27,471 --> 00:29:29,166
It's not up to us.

385
00:29:29,974 --> 00:29:32,306
They can send you back
whenever they want,

386
00:29:32,409 --> 00:29:35,105
and there's nothing we can do about it.
I'm so sorry.

387
00:29:36,413 --> 00:29:38,745
At least this way you'll know,

388
00:29:39,116 --> 00:29:44,144
you'll always know
that she's being taken care of.

389
00:30:09,914 --> 00:30:12,849
- Everyone still alive in here?
- For now.

390
00:30:13,818 --> 00:30:17,219
There's no sign
the storm's letting up, so get comfortable.

391
00:30:17,288 --> 00:30:20,347
- How much longer can it last?
- I don't know, you tell me.

392
00:30:20,757 --> 00:30:23,385
You're the one who picked this place.
It could go on for days, for all we know.

393
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,992
It was this or the barrel of a gun,
and you know it.

394
00:30:27,063 --> 00:30:28,587
James!

395
00:30:29,899 --> 00:30:32,925
Hey, James! James!

396
00:30:33,303 --> 00:30:34,964
Easy, easy.

397
00:30:35,438 --> 00:30:37,929
- I got you. Easy
- That really hurt.

398
00:30:38,107 --> 00:30:39,438
I'll bet.

399
00:30:39,976 --> 00:30:41,637
Don't move. You're going to be okay.

400
00:30:48,284 --> 00:30:49,911
Have you restored the shields yet?

401
00:30:49,986 --> 00:30:51,886
Rush is still bleeding power
from the system.

402
00:30:52,055 --> 00:30:53,716
We can't stop him.

403
00:30:55,325 --> 00:30:56,656
It's worse than we thought.

404
00:30:56,726 --> 00:31:00,184
<i>The next radiation spike from the pulsar
will collapse the shields completely.</i>

405
00:31:00,663 --> 00:31:02,153
Now they know.

406
00:31:02,632 --> 00:31:04,395
They've no choice but to surrender.

407
00:31:09,005 --> 00:31:10,267
They found us.

408
00:31:10,607 --> 00:31:12,939
<i>Dannic,
we've found a door we can't open.</i>

409
00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:14,874
<i>Hydroponics. It appears to
be sealed from the inside.</i>

410
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:18,539
We've got them. Get some explosives.
We'll blow the door.

411
00:31:19,048 --> 00:31:20,982
You can't do that.

412
00:31:21,284 --> 00:31:24,253
Any blast big enough to get you through the
door will kill the people on the inside.

413
00:31:24,687 --> 00:31:27,985
<i>- We need Rush to restore the shields.
There isn't enough time anyway.</i>

414
00:31:28,123 --> 00:31:30,591
The next pulsar wave
is in less than five minutes.

415
00:31:31,293 --> 00:31:32,453
Dannic, this is Rush.

416
00:31:33,428 --> 00:31:34,725
<i>By now you know the situation.</i>

417
00:31:35,397 --> 00:31:38,127
<i>You have no choice.
Lay down your weapons</i>

418
00:31:38,267 --> 00:31:41,725
and order your people to assemble
in the observation deck.

419
00:31:41,803 --> 00:31:46,638
Once I receive visual confirmation of your
compliance, I'll dial up the shields.

420
00:31:50,312 --> 00:31:52,439
I still say you're bluffing.

421
00:31:52,814 --> 00:31:54,577
<i>Our position
is well protected.</i>

422
00:31:54,683 --> 00:31:58,779
Even without the shields
we'll survive the next wave. You won't.

423
00:31:59,154 --> 00:32:01,554
<i>Either way, we take the ship back.</i>

424
00:32:05,494 --> 00:32:08,224
I don't know. It's possible.

425
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:11,064
The man is a coward.
He wouldn't sacrifice himself.

426
00:32:11,133 --> 00:32:13,033
He's telling the truth.

427
00:32:15,137 --> 00:32:18,538
You still have people out here.
You'd be killing them, too.

428
00:32:24,513 --> 00:32:26,378
A necessary sacrifice.

429
00:32:31,453 --> 00:32:32,545
He won't do it.

430
00:32:32,621 --> 00:32:33,645
- Dannic!
- Enough.

431
00:32:33,722 --> 00:32:35,586
- You don't have a choice...
- I said enough!

432
00:32:39,193 --> 00:32:41,423
We're not giving up this ship.

433
00:32:45,366 --> 00:32:48,096
- He's not bluffing.
- Just wait.

434
00:32:48,169 --> 00:32:50,899
He doesn't even know we're watching.
This isn't an act.

435
00:32:55,409 --> 00:32:58,435
You can't do this. You'll kill us all.

436
00:33:00,381 --> 00:33:03,646
We were prepared to die the moment
we stepped through that gate.

437
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:06,619
You're insane.

438
00:33:10,224 --> 00:33:12,215
Did you... Did you just see that?

439
00:33:12,526 --> 00:33:15,859
This guy is nuts.
You can't reason with someone like that.

440
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:26,230
So, what about the others?
What about Scott and Greer, T. J?

441
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,081
I'm sorry.

442
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:54,656
Listen to me.

443
00:33:56,202 --> 00:33:58,227
You know why we came here.

444
00:33:59,873 --> 00:34:02,103
You know what this ship means.

445
00:34:02,842 --> 00:34:06,938
Are you really prepared to let it go
just when it's in our grasp?

446
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,038
You mean your grasp.

447
00:34:10,016 --> 00:34:12,746
Don't listen to him. He's crazy.
He will kill all of us.

448
00:34:12,819 --> 00:34:16,585
No. Just anyone who tries to get in my way.

449
00:34:29,669 --> 00:34:32,900
Telford is right. He was crazy.

450
00:34:41,181 --> 00:34:42,273
Rush?

451
00:34:43,116 --> 00:34:46,176
<i>Dannic is dead.
We'll comply with your demands.</i>

452
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:07,299
Carmen.

453
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:11,033
That's her name.

454
00:35:12,044 --> 00:35:13,944
After her grandmother.

455
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:20,478
I know it's not perfect here,

456
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:24,116
but you said yourself
it's better than that ship.

457
00:35:25,324 --> 00:35:28,350
I still think there's a chance
they're going to help us get back home.

458
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:34,694
If they could do that,
then why haven't they done it already?

459
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:36,233
I don't know.

460
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:39,727
Look, T.J., I have to warn you.

461
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:43,770
No one on the ship is going to understand.

462
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,274
I barely understand myself.

463
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:50,544
No, I... I mean they won't believe,

464
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:54,279
because what they've seen is different.

465
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:58,514
What are you talking about?

466
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:04,761
I have learned one thing
in all of this,

467
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:09,495
and it's that out here
on the edge of the universe,

468
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:14,395
who you are and what you believe
is everything.

469
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:20,167
So it's up to you to decide
if this is a blessing or a curse.

470
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,151
Goodbye, T.J.

471
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:44,795
- Camile?
- Ah, it's okay.

472
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,099
Just take it easy.

473
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:52,933
How long was I gone?

474
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:57,372
- What do you mean?
- How long was I off the ship?

475
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:03,778
You were here the whole time,
and the doctors worked on you.

476
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:08,782
They did the best they could, but...

477
00:37:11,494 --> 00:37:13,121
I'm so sorry.

478
00:37:26,376 --> 00:37:27,900
Welcome back.

479
00:37:29,112 --> 00:37:31,103
You take care, all right?

480
00:37:33,783 --> 00:37:35,910
That way! That way.

481
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:44,089
- Welcome back, sir.
- Well done, Sergeant.

482
00:37:44,995 --> 00:37:46,189
Well done, Lieutenant.

483
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:49,528
It wasn't really us, sir.
Mostly it was Rush.

484
00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:53,495
So, what about them?

485
00:37:55,205 --> 00:37:57,105
Well, let's put them
with the others.

486
00:37:57,641 --> 00:37:58,972
Excuse me.

487
00:37:59,376 --> 00:38:01,503
Sir... Sir?

488
00:38:05,482 --> 00:38:07,382
There's something else.

489
00:38:14,491 --> 00:38:17,153
<i>And after the storm</i>

490
00:38:19,995 --> 00:38:23,158
<i>I run and run as the rains come</i>

491
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:26,258
<i>And I look up</i>

492
00:38:27,136 --> 00:38:29,195
<i>I look up</i>

493
00:38:30,472 --> 00:38:33,635
<i>On my knees and out of luck</i>

494
00:38:33,709 --> 00:38:35,609
<i>I look up</i>

495
00:38:38,314 --> 00:38:42,045
<i>Night has always pushed up day</i>

496
00:38:44,353 --> 00:38:47,550
<i>You must know life to see decay</i>

497
00:38:47,623 --> 00:38:50,615
<i>But I won't rot</i>

498
00:38:51,794 --> 00:38:53,523
<i>I won't rot</i>

499
00:38:54,897 --> 00:38:57,991
<i>Not this mind and not this heart</i>

500
00:38:58,067 --> 00:38:59,728
<i>I won't rot</i>

501
00:39:02,805 --> 00:39:05,899
<i>And I took you by the hand</i>

502
00:39:07,309 --> 00:39:09,140
<i>And we stood tall</i>

503
00:39:10,813 --> 00:39:13,941
<i>And remembered our own land</i>

504
00:39:15,117 --> 00:39:17,278
<i>What we lived for</i>

505
00:39:22,157 --> 00:39:26,058
<i>But there will come
a time, you'll see</i>

506
00:39:26,794 --> 00:39:28,386
<i>With no more tears</i>

507
00:39:28,463 --> 00:39:32,456
<i>And love will not break your heart</i>

508
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,727
<i>But dismiss your fears</i>

509
00:39:34,802 --> 00:39:37,396
<i>Get over your hill</i>

510
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:40,873
<i>And see what you find there</i>

511
00:39:40,942 --> 00:39:43,638
<i>With grace in your heart</i>

512
00:39:43,711 --> 00:39:47,511
<i>And flowers in your hair</i>

513
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:58,887
<i>Well, I guess I'll just go home</i>

514
00:39:59,994 --> 00:40:02,019
<i>Oh, God knows where</i>

515
00:40:03,464 --> 00:40:06,661
<i>Because death is just so full</i>

516
00:40:07,802 --> 00:40:09,861
<i>And mine so small</i>

517
00:40:11,406 --> 00:40:14,671
<i>Well, I'm scared of what's behind</i>

518
00:40:15,676 --> 00:40:17,576
<i>And what's before</i>

519
00:40:22,617 --> 00:40:24,244
That was a quick jump.

520
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:25,808
This is where
we were supposed to come out

521
00:40:25,887 --> 00:40:27,684
before the Lucian Alliance dialed in.

522
00:40:27,755 --> 00:40:29,985
Is there any deadly radiation?

523
00:40:33,828 --> 00:40:35,419
- Brody?
- Hold on.

524
00:40:46,206 --> 00:40:47,571
We're good.

525
00:41:08,662 --> 00:41:11,631
T. J! You should not be getting up...

526
00:41:12,799 --> 00:41:16,462
I'm fine.
I just need to clear my head right now.

527
00:41:27,547 --> 00:41:31,108
<i>There will come a time, you'll see</i>

528
00:41:31,918 --> 00:41:33,579
<i>With no more tears</i>

529
00:41:33,653 --> 00:41:37,646
<i>And love will not break your heart</i>

530
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:39,816
<i>But dismiss your fears</i>

531
00:41:39,893 --> 00:41:42,555
<i>Get over your hill</i>

532
00:41:42,629 --> 00:41:46,064
<i>And see what you find there</i>

533
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:48,861
<i>With grace in your heart</i>

534
00:41:48,934 --> 00:41:52,495
<i>And flowers in your hair</i>

535
00:41:52,571 --> 00:41:56,507
<i>And there will come
a time, you'll see</i>

536
00:41:57,176 --> 00:41:58,666
<i>With no more tears</i>

537
00:41:58,744 --> 00:42:02,840
<i>And love will not break your heart</i>

538
00:42:02,915 --> 00:42:05,008
<i>But dismiss your fears</i>

539
00:42:05,084 --> 00:42:07,746
<i>Get over your hill</i>

540
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:11,256

541
00:42:11,323 --> 00:42:14,087
<i>With grace in your heart</i>

542
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:18,027
<i>And flowers in your hair</i>
