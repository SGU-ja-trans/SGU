00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:06,636
RUSH: This is what Destiny intended from
the moment it entered the star system.

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,349
YOUNG: We are going to survive.
We are going to make it home.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,949
I'm telling you,
the ship came here for a reason!

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,320
RUSH: Destiny is powered
by the stars themselves.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,515
WRAY: He and Young
are bumping heads, yes.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,795
Not sure which camp is the better choice.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,598
YOUNG: We just pretend
nothing happened?

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,353
We need to be ready
for the next encounter.

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,475
For the sake of the crew.

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,515
For the sake of the crew.

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,875
You dreamt you were the spy

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,632
who leaked everything about Icarus
to the Lucian Alliance?

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,278
RUSH: No, no, no, not me. It wasn't me.

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,793
I was Colonel Telford.

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,349
We know that the Goa'uld
had brainwashing technology.

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,159
It is possible that the Alliance
now has that capability.

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,311
Once you are on Earth,
you are on your own.

18
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,789
Whoever you are, you must be using
the Ancient communication stones.

19
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,949
I don't know what you're talking about.

20
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,393
Colonel Telford would never make
such a mistake.

21
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,472
We know that you are
a traitor and a murderer.

22
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,879
Now we know you're a coward, too.

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,111
RUSH: You've found another Icarus planet.

24
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,714
We're all very excited to have
Dr. Rush's full cooperation.

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,028
Kill me, and you kill Rush!

26
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,192
Begin venting the atmosphere
in Colonel Telford's quarters now.

27
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,394
Young!

28
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,432
Open this damn door!

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,751
We both know you're not going to kill me.

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,197
Mr. Brody, this is Wray.

31
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,236
- You need to restore the atmosphere...
- This is Young.

32
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,390
Please disregard that request.

33
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,428
WRAY: By letting this happen,

34
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,592
you are participating
in not only the murder of Colonel Telford,

35
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,033
but Dr. Rush, as well.

36
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,677
Okay. Sir, you've made your point.

37
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,557
I'm not trying to make a point.

38
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,834
- Come on. Open the door, sir, please.
- I know what I'm doing.

39
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,876
- What you're doing is killing him!
- I know that, Lieutenant.

40
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,678
- WRAY: Brody!
- What should we do?

41
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,279
The Colonel's bluffing.
He's not going to kill him.

42
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,430
What's happening to him?

43
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,030
All right. No. Sir, I cannot...

44
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,237
You've killed him.

45
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,873
Brody.

46
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,518
YOUNG: Come on, David. Come on.

47
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,872
David, come on.

48
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,191
TELFORD: You're all in danger.
YOUNG: What?

49
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,280
- They're coming.
- Who's coming?

50
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,635
The Lucian Alliance.
They're coming to take Destiny.

51
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,952
YOUNG ON PA: We've been informed
that this ship faces an incursion

52
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,713
by armed forces of the Lucian Alliance,

53
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,598
the group responsible for the attack
on Icarus Base.

54
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,238
All military personnel onboard
have been placed on high alert.

55
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,949
If the enemy has acquired the means
to dial Destiny,

56
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,759
their point of ingress will be the stargate.

57
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,829
Brody, we're clear.

58
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,878
YOUNG: So, the Gate Room is off-limits.

59
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,956
All surrounding corridors
have been placed in lockdown.

60
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,149
Come on! Come on, let's go!

61
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,073
YOUNG: No one may enter
without proper authorization.

62
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,590
I've provided Homeworld Security
with intel on the planet

63
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,229
from which the Lucian Alliance
intends to launch their assault.

64
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,998
They're dispatching forces as I speak.

65
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,117
YOUNG: The best-case scenario,

66
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,716
Earth forces take the launch point intact
and we gain a supply line from home.

67
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,911
The worst-case scenario

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,070
is that our forces don't make it
before the attack is launched,

69
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,197
in which case we'll have to deal with them
on our end.

70
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,434
In that event, all non-military personnel
will be ordered back to your quarters,

71
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,592
where you will remain
until the situation has been resolved.

72
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,877
Make no mistake, this will be dealt with
swiftly and decisively.

73
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,391
Thank you. That is all.

74
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,074
Colonel.

75
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,475
Only a couple of hours ago,
Colonel Telford admitted to being a mole

76
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,394
for the Lucian Alliance.
And now, suddenly, he's on our side?

77
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,118
YOUNG: Yeah.
WRAY: You trust him?

78
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,952
I didn't say that.

79
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,830
- What in the hell was that?
- "What in the hell was that, sir?"

80
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,354
- All you had to do was tell me.
- I was keeping you out of it.

81
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,998
You didn't have to.

82
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,355
If I'd known that killing him
and bringing him back

83
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,351
was the only way to beat
that brainwashing technology,

84
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,953
I'd have been behind you 100%.

85
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,838
So, you'll follow orders as long as
I explain everything to you beforehand?

86
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,751
- No, sir, that is not what I meant.
- Well, that's good,

87
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,956
because if it was,
we'd have a problem, Lieutenant.

88
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,996
Do we have a problem?

89
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,875
- No, sir...
- Good,

90
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,269
because now is not the time for that.

91
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,076
- No headaches or blurred vision?
- No. I told you, I'm fine.

92
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,799
Well, Rush is fine. I'll find out about me
when I switch back.

93
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,749
Look, I really need to go and...

94
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,119
T.J., can you give us a minute?

95
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,278
- Yes, sir.
- Thanks.

96
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,551
How are you feeling, David?

97
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,838
- Confused.
- I bet.

98
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,673
You went the whole nine yards.
To the brink and back.

99
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,034
I had to.

100
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,350
You know, in my defense,
it wasn't the first thing I tried.

101
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,357
Yeah. Thanks for that.

102
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,477
At least the brainwashing
explains why you've been such an ass.

103
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,158
I've read the SG mission reports
of that method being done in the past.

104
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,673
I just never...

105
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,074
You have no idea what it's like
to remember things that you've done,

106
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,309
that...

107
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,312
Terrible things.

108
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,710
You weren't yourself, David.

109
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,750
- You've got to send me back.
- Not yet.

110
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,035
- I've done all that I can on this end.
- I've already killed you once.

111
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,793
I'm more useful to you in my own body,
back there with them, Everett,

112
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,235
you know that. How the hell else
are you gonna get Rush back?

113
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,514
- Listen...
- You've got to get him out of there.

114
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,511
David, listen to me,
you've just come back from the dead.

115
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,750
I want you to get your strength back first.

116
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,279
Excuse us.

117
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,671
T.J., listen, when they come,
I want you here, safe.

118
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,113
Safe?

119
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,792
Look, if they break containment,
there could be wounded.

120
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,313
We're going to need you.

121
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,674
What we'll need is a real doctor.

122
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,910
- You're up for this.
- Not even close.

123
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,592
What are you planning to do?

124
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,592
Evacuate the atmosphere in the
Gate Room the minute they step through.

125
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,118
Kill them all, you mean.

126
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,598
You think I have a choice?

127
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,598
If you're asking for forgiveness,
I can't help you there either.

128
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,072
- T.J.
- I'll do my best.

129
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,553
KIVA: You're back.

130
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,673
That was me.

131
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,551
I had to see whether you were faking.

132
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,279
Well, I wasn't.

133
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,799
I apologize.

134
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,432
Back to work. I know.

135
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,788
Running planetary scans.

136
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,389
Whoa.

137
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,638
CARTER: Sir, it looks like the intel is good.

138
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,188
The planet's laced
with naquadria deposits.

139
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,032
We're also reading a huge energy signature

140
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,111
emanating from what looks like a pyramid.

141
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,077
Pyramid? That takes me back.

142
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,277
Unfortunately, the complex inside
is shielded against beaming technology.

143
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,918
So, Rush can't be beamed out.

144
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,912
No, sir. We'll have to go in
with ground forces from the outside.

145
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,715
All right, Colonel. You have a go.

146
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,679
What was that?

147
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,272
KIVA: We're under attack.

148
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,279
Can we dial the ninth chevron?

149
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,759
Not without blowing everything up.

150
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,914
Dial it.

151
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,879
Get ready!

152
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,633
We're going now!

153
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,556
JACKSON: The Lucian Alliance
is an organization of humans

154
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,039
from a number of sovereign planets

155
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,759
who have taken control
of the resources and technology...

156
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,274
The Alliance is made up of power-hungry...

157
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,559
...violence as a means
of enforcing their dominion.

158
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,469
- The Air Force video?
- ELI: Yeah.

159
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,030
I'm just seeing if there's anything in here
that might help.

160
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,032
...control a sizable army
and numerous Ha'tak vessels,

161
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,315
or former Goa'uld motherships.

162
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,869
- What's he going to do?
- The Colonel?

163
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,151
They're sending an army.

164
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,752
What do you think he's going to do?

165
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,953
This is it.

166
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,356
- It's happening now?
- Yeah.

167
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,674
Go! Radio back when you reach
the other side.

168
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,119
And take him with you.

169
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,713
Colonel Young.

170
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,632
I see them, Eli.

171
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,075
All personnel,
report to your designated areas.

172
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,958
This is not a drill. Defense teams stand by.

173
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,078
MAN 1: Copy that. Go, go!

174
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,716
- Which button?
- BRODY: This one.

175
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,995
How long will it take till we reach vacuum?

176
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,036
- A minute or so?
- That's about right.

177
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,079
BRODY: Colonel.

178
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,714
Defense teams stand by
to secure prisoners on my order.

179
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,194
Copy that.

180
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,720
Monitor from here. Stay on the radio.

181
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,839
Got it.

182
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,354
- RUSH: What happened?
- Colonel?

183
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,433
- No, no, it's me.
- Rush?

184
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,389
Yeah.

185
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,473
The ship, the Lucian Alliance...

186
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,154
Yeah, no, we know everything.
Telford told us.

187
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,679
So what are we doing about it, then?

188
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,039
Let's just say it'll all be over
in a few minutes.

189
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,359
Colonel, I'm reading a huge energy spike.

190
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,992
At this rate, they've got less than a minute
before their core goes up.

191
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,197
Get our people out of the shielded areas
and beam them back to the ship, now!

192
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,432
The core is going to go critical.
I can't stop it.

193
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,357
Still no signal from the other side?

194
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,396
Get as many of our people through
as you can.

195
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,711
- Load it up.
- Watch out!

196
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,711
- Watch it, watch it.
- MAN 2: Clear there.

197
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,798
Colonel, we still have two 302s
on their way back from the planet.

198
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,428
We can't wait. Get us out of here.

199
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,998
MAN: No!

200
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,634
Aren't we supposed to go to our quarters?

201
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,393
These are my quarters,
and I'm not going anywhere.

202
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,028
- Colonel?
- They brought Rush along with them.

203
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,509
We're going to have to do this
the hard way.

204
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,358
KIVA: What did you do to the gate?
TELFORD: It wasn't me.

205
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,556
You killed over a hundred of my men!

206
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,312
It was Rush!

207
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,515
Massin.

208
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,555
Massin, your father's name,
it was my password.

209
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,835
Gate travel must have severed the link.
It's me.

210
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,993
Telford?

211
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,755
YOUNG: Lucian Alliance forces,
you are surrounded and sealed in.

212
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,637
You will also find the intel provided
by Colonel Telford is now useless.

213
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,075
Lay down your weapons
in front of the doors

214
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,358
and step back into the center of the room
with your hands on your heads,

215
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,034
or we will vent the entire compartment
to space.

216
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,795
- Can they do it?
- Yes.

217
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,913
Then they should have.

218
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,079
Colonel, they're up to something.

219
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,513
Talk to me.

220
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,149
They've got something to open the doors!

221
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,276
Vent the atmosphere in the Gate Room.
Brody, do it now.

222
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,679
BRODY: Too late.

223
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,793
Take cover!

224
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,598
Get back!

225
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,829
YOUNG: Go!

226
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,759
Uh, Rush, you should stay here.

227
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,592
No, no. The ship's under attack.

228
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,795
Rush!

229
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,555
Rush!

230
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,593
- Okay, Eli, it's time to go.
- No, just wait.

231
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,557
No, Eli, let's go. Now!

232
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,513
Yeah. Yeah.

233
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,151
ELI: There's an elevator this way.

234
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,549
CHLOE: Oh, God.

235
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,069
YOUNG: Go!

236
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,239
JOHANSEN: Rush! Wait!

237
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,273
BRODY ON KINO: You're welcome.

238
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,752
Want to get the hell out of there now?

239
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,316
ELI: Chloe, you've been shot.

240
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,632
Sorry, sorry.

241
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,479
See? It's okay.

242
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,312
You'll be... You'll be okay.

243
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,674
Eli, I...

244
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,793
Okay.

245
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,230
Hey, you'll be fine.

246
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,752
You'll be fine, all right?

247
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,033
Chloe?

248
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,231
I'll be right back. Okay?

249
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,230
MAN 4: This way. Let's go!

250
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,559
WOMAN 1: Over here.

251
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,953
Colonel Young?

252
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,714
Who is this?

253
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,120
Commander Kiva
of the Lucian Alliance forces.

254
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,116
We will not be complying
with your request to surrender.

255
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,033
We barely made hyperspace.
This time it was even closer.

256
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,954
What about casualties?

257
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,634
Two of my 302s couldn't make it back,
and if Rush was still on the planet...

258
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,674
I'm sorry, Sam.

259
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,718
Yes, sir.
Did any of them make it to Destiny?

260
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,193
I haven't heard.

261
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,594
MAN 1: Hands behind your back. Do it!

262
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,718
BRODY: So much for that.

263
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,873
Why didn't you evacuate
the compartment to space?

264
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,157
- That was the plan.
- He didn't do it to save you.

265
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,434
Not me.

266
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,475
The connection was severed
the minute I stepped through the gate.

267
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,156
Give me the lay of the land.

268
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,509
RUSH: This is the Gate Room.

269
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,068
They also occupy
the surrounding corridors.

270
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,912
They had advanced further,
but they pulled back.

271
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,594
Just took what they could hold
with limited manpower. That's smart.

272
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,558
BRODY: Once they retreated,
I locked down the area behind them.

273
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,870
Given the technology at their disposal,
it won't stop them,

274
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,190
but it should give us some breathing room.

275
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,077
RUSH: The prisoners are being held here.

276
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,310
Between them and us,
30 feet of corridor either way.

277
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,958
Well, the second we hit
that outside section,

278
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,190
those hostages are as good as dead.

279
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,478
- SCOTT: Colonel.
- Yeah?

280
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,798
I've done a head count.

281
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,075
We have 12 missing
and presumed captured,

282
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,278
including Riley, T.J., Eli, and Chloe.

283
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,914
ELI: Come on!

284
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,229
Eli?

285
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,113
Hey. Hey.

286
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,594
- What happened?
- You were shot.

287
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,714
I stopped the bleeding.
No, you're fine. Look up here.

288
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,791
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

289
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,598
Where are we?

290
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,989
I don't know.

291
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,991
I've never been to this part
of the ship before.

292
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,911
I don't think anyone has.

293
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,750
I just pressed some random buttons.

294
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,512
We can't get back.

295
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,591
I'm guessing someone
locked out elevator access.

296
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,272
Us or them?

297
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,556
Yeah, that's the problem.

298
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,193
I just need to get to a window,
get an idea of where we are

299
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,840
and then we can walk back.

300
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,470
Oh, no, no, no, no. I've got you.

301
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,118
Come on. Come here.

302
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,469
Ready? Here we go. One, two, three.

303
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,755
Okay. Okay.

304
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,393
- Lean on me.
- Okay.

305
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,040
- I've got you. Ready?
- Yeah.

306
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,073
There you go.

307
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,829
Colonel Young.

308
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,749
Go ahead.

309
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,115
Here's how I see the situation.

310
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,633
We have the Gate Room
and some of your people.

311
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,918
You hold the Control Interface Room,
which, I'm told, is the ship's nerve center.

312
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,069
YOUNG: What do you want?

313
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,720
We came here
for the same reasons you did.

314
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,517
We don't want to hurt anyone.

315
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,999
You're welcome to stay aboard Destiny

316
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,196
and help us realize the potential
of her discovery.

317
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,275
Lay down your weapons and join us.

318
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,556
Or, if you prefer, we can drop you off

319
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,551
at the next inhabitable world
of your choosing.

320
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,871
Or I vent the atmosphere
in the sections you're occupying

321
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,518
and keep the ship.

322
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,190
If you had that in you, Colonel,
you would have done it already.

323
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,556
The point is, I have the ability
to end this conversation right now.

324
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,795
- Sergeant?
- She wanted to see you, sir.

325
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,031
- Wouldn't shut up, in fact.
- As you were, Sergeant.

326
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,755
We are way past the point of fighting
our way out of this situation.

327
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,310
We need to negotiate with these people.
And I think I should be the one to...

328
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,550
Yeah, yeah. No, I think you're right.

329
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,592
Him. Him.

330
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,239
And her.

331
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,795
That's a mistake.

332
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,114
It's a demonstration.

333
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,077
All it will do is force their hand.

334
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,591
Do you want control of the ship or not?

335
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,428
WRAY: They have some of our people.
YOUNG: But we have some of theirs.

336
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,910
So the first thing we need to do
is suggest an exchange.

337
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,036
- Do you think they'll do it?
- No.

338
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,917
But I think it's worth a shot.

339
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,397
TELFORD: This is
the Control Interface Room.

340
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,595
This is the Gate Room.

341
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,310
If we cut our way through the wall here,
we can flank them. I can lead a team.

342
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,072
That will reduce our numbers here.

343
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,832
We take the Control Interface Room,
we won't need them here.

344
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,273
The ship will be ours.

345
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,079
KIVA: These sections are in red.

346
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,912
That section of corridor
is exposed to space.

347
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,275
The ship's shield will hold long enough
for us to pass.

348
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,271
We will slowly vent atmosphere
to space, yes,

349
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,318
but we could seal the corridor again
after we've taken the ship.

350
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,557
- KIVA: Take six men.
- I'll need twice that...

351
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,073
Six.

352
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,677
And if anything goes wrong,

353
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,838
these three die.

354
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,068
Not her.

355
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,398
She's a medic.
We can use her in the event...

356
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,959
WRAY ON RADIO: Commander Kiva.

357
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,520
- Who is this?
- My name is Camile Wray.

358
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,354
I am the civilian authority aboard this ship.

359
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,113
I'd like to act as an intermediary

360
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,078
to resolve this issue
without further bloodshed.

361
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,233
Colonel Young will not transfer control
of this ship to you.

362
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,799
KIVA: And you will?

363
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:26,317
No. But I will expedite
a prisoner exchange.

364
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,472
Your people for ours.

365
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,959
If I release my prisoners,

366
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,600
Colonel Young will not hesitate
to vent this compartment.

367
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,995
You have 12 of our people.
We have only four of yours.

368
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,516
I propose an even trade, four for four.

369
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,673
This way, you maintain your advantage
and gain some much-needed manpower.

370
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,832
Colonel Young agrees with this?

371
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,113
In our society the military takes orders
from civilian leadership.

372
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,069
I'll consider it.

373
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,470
Nice job. That should buy us some time.

374
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:13,348
Look, you're trying to save lives here.
Obviously, that's a good thing.

375
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,796
But even if she agrees to the four,
which is doubtful,

376
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,632
she won't go any farther than that.

377
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,439
Once the equation tips
to the point of acceptable losses...

378
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,078
No, no, no.
There will be no acceptable losses.

379
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,993
Colonel Young has already determined
what that number is.

380
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,629
He knows the chances of us winning
without loss of life are practically nil.

381
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,075
So limit our losses, yes, all that we can,

382
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,593
but eventually,
you're going to have to do something...

383
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,795
You don't know what you're talking about.

384
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,677
You forget, I've recently been
one of your acceptable losses...

385
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,988
You knew what you
were getting yourself into, Rush.

386
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,150
You should have disconnected the stones
and got me out!

387
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,389
You have no clue
what you're talking about!

388
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,357
Stop this now, please!

389
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,951
I am going to save
every one of those hostages,

390
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,112
and I'm going to retake this ship.
Do you understand me?

391
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,235
All right, Telford has convinced her
that he is still with them,

392
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,515
otherwise he would be dead by now.

393
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,955
Sooner or later he will make his move.

394
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:08,028
So, we are to gamble this ship
and all of our lives

395
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:12,553
in the hope that some traitor
has had a change of heart.

396
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,233
ELI: Look at that.

397
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,236
I guess those elevators go
more than just up and down.

398
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,312
Yes, right there.

399
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,633
- You good?
- Yeah.

400
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,949
I must have hit a few buttons
I wasn't supposed to press.

401
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,517
Is the air getting thin?

402
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,195
Life support isn't working out here.

403
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,479
How do you know?

404
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,916
I was the one who shut it off.

405
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,279
Rush's orders.

406
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,908
I mean, there's air. There just isn't
any new air being pumped in.

407
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,752
- So we need to keep moving?
- Yeah.

408
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,596
- Okay?
- I don't know if I can.

409
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,593
No problem.

410
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,238
I got you.

411
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,076
This is my lieutenant, Varro.

412
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,679
Save him.

413
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,113
He's badly wounded.

414
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,711
At even the slightest hint of trouble,
Lieutenant...

415
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,356
I'll bring you back, sir.

416
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,395
I need to speak to General O'Neill.

417
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,389
O'NEILL: Second-guessing a decision
is a waste of time.

418
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,753
I'm not there.

419
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,275
But I'm starting to wonder
if maybe I should be.

420
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,998
I can't speak to that, sir.

421
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,193
- This should be done, Colonel. Over.
- Yes, sir.

422
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,272
At the time, I believed
that venting the Gate Room

423
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,828
would kill both Dr. Rush
and Colonel Telford.

424
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,517
- They deserved a chance.
- We lost two 302 pilots

425
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,068
- sent to stop the attack.
- I'm sorry.

426
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,879
Colonel Carter knew she'd lose her ship
if she tried to save them,

427
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,030
but it was the right decision.

428
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,514
Yes, sir.

429
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,110
Are you up for this, Everett?

430
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,069
Yes, sir.

431
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,196
Because somebody will take your place
if you're not.

432
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,113
I'm not going to let anybody
take that ship, sir.

433
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,838
Then get your ass back there.

434
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,633
TELFORD: We're good.

435
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,158
What are you doing?

436
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,433
Just checking to make sure
we're headed in the right direction.

437
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,188
This way.

438
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,993
There's no countdown.

439
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,629
VOLKER: What?

440
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,631
We dropped out of FTL
because someone was gating in.

441
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,154
Why haven't we jumped back?

442
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,993
Someone just activated a console
in one of the access corridors.

443
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,629
Colonel, a console just came on
using Telford's code.

444
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,597
They're in a cordoned-off section
coming our way.

445
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,318
That's his move.

446
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,116
- It's cold.
- Really?

447
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,955
- ELI: Okay. Watch your foot. Good?
- Yeah.

448
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,037
We have to be careful
moving through sections.

449
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,554
There's a reason
we've never been out this far.

450
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,712
A ton of compartments are de-pressurized.

451
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,677
- Okay?
- Thank you.

452
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,591
Hang on. Okay.

453
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,438
- Ready?
- Yeah.

454
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,193
Okay.

455
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,560
More dark and gloomy. We're good.

456
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,349
Coming?

457
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,070
Gotcha. Good? Gotcha.

458
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,675
- ELI: How are you doing?
- I'm okay.

459
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,795
ELI: You sure?

460
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,435
Stand by.

461
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,669
Yes, sir. We're good to go.

462
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,275
Ready.

463
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,755
GREER: Just give the word, sir.

464
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,074
- It's locked down.
- I'll handle it.

465
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,399
Okay, get ready.

466
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,198
SCOTT: What was that?

467
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,190
MAN: This way. Let's go. This way.

468
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,759
YOUNG: Ready?

469
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,675
What happened?

470
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,555
- You didn't do that?
- What is that?

471
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,158
Just a minute ago, it was a man.

472
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,997
You need to stand down
till we figure this out.

473
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,874
This is Young. Everybody stand down.

474
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,196
- Throw me a radio.
- Radio?

475
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,595
Three clicks, go to channel six.
We're going to have to try this again.

476
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,030
CHLOE: Let's stop.
ELI: No. I'm fine.

477
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:02,908
- Eli, you don't...
- Seriously, this is nothing.

478
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:11,118
Once, I climbed the Redridge Mountains
on my way to Stonard

479
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,192
- with a full pack.
- Where's that?

480
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,318
World of Warcraft.

481
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,553
Wow, that...

482
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,632
That must've given you
quite the sense of accomplishment.

483
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,634
- Eli...
- Okay, okay.

484
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,188
- Okay, a little break. A little break.
- Yeah.

485
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,998
All right, all right.

486
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,548
So, what do you think is happening?

487
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,513
- We've probably won by now.
- You think so?

488
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,075
If we won,
then why haven't we been rescued?

489
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:00,595
Well, first, they have to figure out
what to do with the prisoners,

490
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,473
and then there's
that whole post-victory celebration.

491
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,879
I mean, streamers everywhere.

492
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,359
I'm so tired.

493
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,954
You're still... You're still losing blood.

494
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,318
- I wasn't able to stop it completely.
- Eli...

495
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,995
Hey.

496
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,278
I'm going to take care of you.

497
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,239
It wasn't them.

498
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,514
Now, I don't know
what happened to our man,

499
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,749
but I know that
they had nothing to do with it.

500
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,353
They don't have anything
that could do that to a person.

501
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,079
Are you telling me that
they had nothing to do with this?

502
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,039
TELFORD: What happened?

503
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,515
BRODY: Overload in the power relays
proceeded by temporary disruption

504
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,160
of all shipboard systems,
lights to life support.

505
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,834
- Well, how the hell did they manage that?
- They didn't.

506
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,514
- Well, then, what caused it?
- That's what I'm trying to figure out.

507
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,909
They're making their move.

508
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,429
It wouldn't be that obvious.

509
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,317
KIVA: Colonel Young. Would you care
to tell me what's going on?

510
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,833
We don't know.

511
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,032
One of my men is dead.

512
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,758
You need to know that
we had nothing to do with that.

513
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,034
Yes, so I'm told.

514
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,790
I'm going to ask for a show of good faith.

515
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,430
What do you want?

516
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,434
Colonel?

517
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,039
Lieutenant.

518
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,194
How are you?

519
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,869
I'm fine. We're all fine.

520
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,832
What is it that they want?

521
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,275
Some of their people are injured badly.

522
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,950
I'm going to need medical supplies
to help them.

523
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,395
What will this accomplish?

524
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,119
WRAY: A goodwill gesture
doesn't have to accomplish anything.

525
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,713
Of course it does!

526
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,678
So they lack medical supplies?
Who knows what else they might lack?

527
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,193
Food? Water?

528
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,316
Now, in time, they're gonna get desperate.
They'll make their move,

529
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,277
and when they do,
they'll be dealing with the hostages first.

530
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,117
There's only one way this is going to end
if we wait.

531
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,519
How do you know that?

532
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,238
We don't even know
what's going on with the ship!

533
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,878
All the more reason to act now.

534
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,237
Rush is right. We have to take them down,

535
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,072
and we have to do it right now.
