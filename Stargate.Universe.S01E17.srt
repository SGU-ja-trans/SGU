00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,197
RUSH: This is what Destiny intended from
the moment it entered the star system.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,076
YOUNG: We are going to survive.
We are going to make it home.

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,119
I'm telling you,
the ship came here for a reason!

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,188
RUSH: This ship is powered
by the stars themselves.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,350
WRAY: He and Young
are bumping heads, yes.

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,590
Not sure which camp is the better choice.

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,518
YOUNG: We just pretend
nothing happened?

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,636
We need to be ready
for the next encounter.

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,758
For the sake of the crew.

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,559
For the sake of the crew.

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,119
Dad! No, wait!

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,670
RUSH: You know, the Icarus Project was
something your father truly believed in.

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,829
CHLOE: A son?

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,638
- What's his name?
- Matthew.

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,672
RUSH: The few times I was conscious,
they were probing my mind.

16
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,194
That's something
I'd rather not think about, really.

17
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,315
JAMES: There a reason your radio's off?

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,234
What, you couldn't find a broom closet?

19
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,111
I feel love

20
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,118
A filthy flavor

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,953
One man's weakness

22
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,430
Is another man's pleasure

23
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,353
I've got no feeling

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,192
I don't know how

25
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,430
We make no sense out of this

26
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,435
But I got to, somehow

27
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,830
So, what you want me to do?

28
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,150
What you want me to do?

29
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,958
What are you doing?

30
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,879
I should go.

31
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,711
What? Why?

32
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,437
I can't be doing this.

33
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,748
Right.

34
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,429
You say that now that you're done.

35
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,600
You knew what you were getting into.

36
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,909
You know what? No. Screw that.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,468
I am not going to let you kick me aside
like you did before.

38
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,312
Yeah, well, whatever.

39
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,869
Move.

40
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,350
Me or her. You can't have both.

41
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,079
I never said I wanted both. Now, move.

42
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,354
Me or her, Matt.

43
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,078
Get out of my way.

44
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,948
Oh, for...

45
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,149
This is Dr. Volker.
Anybody in the Control Interface Room?

46
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,871
How about anybody at all?

47
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,999
Hello?

48
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,628
Anybody?

49
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,994
You okay?

50
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,034
Yeah. The door control doesn't work.

51
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,315
No, you don't have to... Okay.

52
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,959
Stupid ship.

53
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,598
Where is everybody?

54
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,277
I don't know.
The room was empty when I got here.

55
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,077
Can I help you with something?

56
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,470
- What are you doing?
- Nothing you need to worry about.

57
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,198
I like to worry.

58
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,913
I was just updating some personnel files.

59
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,918
In the Gate Room.

60
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,195
Colonel Young and Dr. Rush know all
about it, in case you'd like to talk to them.

61
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,838
I'll do that.

62
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,154
ELI: Greer.

63
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,952
Have you seen Matt?

64
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,153
I have not.

65
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,190
YOUNG:
Lieutenant James, come in.

66
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,195
Lieutenant James, this is Colonel Young.
Please respond.

67
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,349
Yes, sir.

68
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,398
You're late with
the current ammunition count.

69
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,469
Lieutenant, what are you doing?

70
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,669
Nothing, sir. I'm fine. I am...

71
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,789
I just lost track of time,
but I'm on my way now.

72
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,033
James out.

73
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,273
So I heard that Colonel Young's
calling off the search for Franklin.

74
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,349
Yeah.

75
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,228
It's not like anyone was really looking
for him. The man just vanished.

76
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,469
Weird.

77
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,108
Dunning, come on.

78
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,878
What the hell?

79
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,679
SCOTT: Dr. Volker?

80
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,833
You okay?

81
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,315
Something weird's going on here.

82
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,118
What is it?

83
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,637
You look tired.
Maybe you should go lie down.

84
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,675
Yeah. Maybe I will.

85
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,954
Matthew?

86
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,473
- Nicholas.
- Hi.

87
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,352
Something wrong?

88
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,510
I need to talk to you
about something that...

89
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,953
YOUNG: Just the two I need to see.

90
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,314
WRAY: Colonel.

91
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,116
Am I interrupting something?

92
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,469
No.

93
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,039
Good.

94
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,236
WRAY: I wasn't even
in the Gate Room today.

95
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,673
RUSH: He said it was empty?

96
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,318
YOUNG: Only person in the room was Wray,

97
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,075
working at one of the consoles,
updating the files.

98
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,957
Said you told him that
Rush and I knew all about it.

99
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,031
RUSH: No, I don't know
anything about this.

100
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,317
And I don't know what to tell you,
Colonel, other than he's lying.

101
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,038
He has no reason to lie.

102
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,951
Please.

103
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,510
Sergeant Greer has had it in for us since
the first day we came aboard this ship.

104
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,479
Correction. Since the day the two of you
led a mutiny to take it over.

105
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,835
I can understand the suspicion.

106
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,630
I was not in the Gate Room.

107
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,630
Hey! Are you all right?

108
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,991
You didn't pass anyone
in the corridor just now?

109
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,149
No.

110
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,312
Oh, my God...

111
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,549
Matt, what happened?

112
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,878
PARK:
We need help in the work-out room!

113
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,396
Anyone from military,
as many as possible! Now!

114
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,469
DUNNING: Get it out!

115
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,959
Oh, my God.

116
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,274
Get it out! Get it out! Get it out!

117
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,349
Help!

118
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,318
He thinks a snake is
crawling under his skin.

119
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,155
YOUNG: A snake?

120
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,516
He said it was crawling around
under his skin, but no one saw anything.

121
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,431
He just flipped out.

122
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,636
I can't find anything
physically wrong with him

123
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,915
other than the wounds
that he inflicted on himself.

124
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,150
Have you noticed any unusual behavior
from him lately?

125
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,549
No, he's been his normal self.

126
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,597
As far as I can tell.

127
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,229
All right, well, let's... Let's keep him here,

128
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,709
close eye on him, and let me know
when the sedatives wear off.

129
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,677
I want to talk to him.

130
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,429
ELI: No warning or anything?

131
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,080
- He just... Just went nuts?
- CHLOE: Yeah.

132
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,516
Some kind of nervous breakdown.
It was pretty scary.

133
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,955
Tearing gashes in your own arms?
That's... That's intense.

134
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,519
RILEY: The stress of life on this ship,

135
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,592
day after day of not knowing
what's ahead...

136
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,513
It's a wonder more people
aren't cracking up.

137
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,513
I'm just glad he took it out on himself.

138
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,478
And he didn't start shooting people.

139
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,874
Hey, you all right?

140
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,556
Hello? Earth to Greer?

141
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,119
I'm fine.

142
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,438
I always figured he'd be the first to snap.

143
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,792
Sergeant Greer?

144
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,595
If you want to accuse me of something,
come forward.

145
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,432
No need for spying.

146
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,792
BRODY: Who you talking to?

147
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,478
Apparently no one.

148
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,157
No. No.

149
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,358
No! Help!

150
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,757
Someone help me, please!
Get me out of here!

151
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,831
Get me out of here!

152
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,990
Hey! Get me out of here!

153
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,514
Well, where the hell is she?

154
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,353
I don't know, sir. I tried to radio her.
She's not responding.

155
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,158
Oh, for God's sake.

156
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,756
Lieutenant James, come in.

157
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,510
Lieutenant James, this is Colonel Young.
Please respond.

158
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,794
James!

159
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,153
I'm so sorry.

160
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,832
You can't be real.

161
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,792
Why did you leave me?

162
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,552
YOUNG: Lieutenant Scott.

163
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,751
Yeah, Colonel, go ahead.

164
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,990
YOUNG: I need you in the infirmary.

165
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,833
- You're alive?
- YOUNG: She thinks she killed you.

166
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,638
How did you... You were in my room.

167
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,676
You're hallucinating.
Just like Airman Dunning.

168
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,149
- What the hell is going on here?
- YOUNG: We don't know yet.

169
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,629
JOHANSEN: I can't find anything
physically wrong with either one of them.

170
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,631
I'm seeing things, too.

171
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,478
Hallucinations.

172
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,279
My son. I keep seeing him on the ship.

173
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,999
I just... I just talked to him.

174
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,192
Your away team.

175
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,714
James and Dunning went offworld
with you to the last planet.

176
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,631
Maybe they picked something up.

177
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,790
We didn't ingest anything that...

178
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,075
It could've been airborne,
any number of possibilities.

179
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,390
Corporal Barnes was on
the away team, as well.

180
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,038
So was Dr. Volker.

181
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,798
VOLKER: Help!
Oh, please, somebody help me!

182
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,438
Colonel, we got him.

183
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,991
- Nothing?
- No.

184
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,877
No weird things out of the corner
of your eye?

185
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,269
- YOUNG: Disorientation?
- No.

186
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,956
Feeling pretty much the way I always do.
Hungry, tired, but I'm not seeing things.

187
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,998
Maybe she's immune to whatever it is
the others picked up.

188
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,913
Maybe her symptoms
are just taking longer to show up.

189
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,989
Thanks.

190
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,038
- But physically, they're okay?
- So far as I can tell, yeah.

191
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,953
He's doing fine, but I'm going
to quarantine the entire away team.

192
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,713
Hopefully isolate the hallucinations
until they pass.

193
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,711
What if they don't pass?
What if it gets worse?

194
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,597
I'm sure whatever it is, T.J.'ll figure it out.

195
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,513
I mean, she's done pretty damn good
so far.

196
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,558
- Is there anything I can do?
- No. No, I'll pass the word.

197
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,916
I'll let everyone know what's going on,
but the situation's been contained,

198
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,718
so there's no need for anybody
to get alarmed.

199
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,789
As soon as I know anything...

200
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,189
JOHANSEN:
Colonel Young, come in.

201
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,274
Yeah, T.J.

202
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,591
Can you come to the infirmary?
I just discovered something.

203
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,669
You see?

204
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,679
JOHANSEN: So, it's difficult to see,

205
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,716
which is why I missed it
on my initial examination.

206
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,268
- You see right there?
- YOUNG: Hmm. Yeah, it looks like a tick.

207
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,237
JOHANSEN: Yeah,
I just checked the others.

208
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,278
They all have one, same spot,
the top of the neck there.

209
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,033
All except Corporal Barnes. She's clear.

210
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,518
CHLOE: Welcome to our new galaxy.

211
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,990
So, the ticks are causing
the hallucinations?

212
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,310
I don't know for sure, but I think so.

213
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,951
Maybe they inject a venom, some sort of
toxin that affects the brain's chemistry.

214
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,678
VOLKER: Okay, I want out.

215
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,189
Please, just get me out of here.
I want out of here, T.J.

216
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,475
Okay, okay, just relax, okay?

217
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,399
Can you remove it?

218
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,792
They seem similar to Earth ticks.
I could try and remove it the same way.

219
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,356
You up for going first?

220
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,794
JOHANSEN: Okay.

221
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,355
JOHANSEN: Lieutenant Scott?

222
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,873
CHLOE: What happened?
JOHANSEN: I don't know.

223
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,235
He's crashing. Let's start CPR.

224
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,472
He's breathing.

225
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,839
He's back.

226
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,798
YOUNG: All right.
Did we get it? We remove it?

227
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,556
JOHANSEN: It's dug in even deeper.

228
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,753
His pulse is normal. BP's back in range.

229
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,508
YOUNG: Listen.

230
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,078
- Is removing them impossible?
- No.

231
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,550
It's just that when I tried to pull it off,
it must have released more toxin.

232
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,198
I just have to figure out another way.

233
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,633
YOUNG: Get to it.

234
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,508
CHLOE: Hello?

235
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,518
Hello, sweetheart.

236
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,631
It's all right. It's really me.

237
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,315
No. No, you're... You're not real.

238
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,311
- Chloe.
- Oh, God.

239
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,277
No, this isn't happening.

240
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,715
Hey. Chloe.

241
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,553
Look at me.

242
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,036
Whether I'm real or not,

243
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,476
aren't you at least happy
to see your old man?

244
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,510
I have missed you, sweetheart.

245
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,991
I missed you so much.

246
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,633
RUSH: So, where do you want to put them?
WRAY: If we do this, then we could...

247
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,676
RUSH: Just... Okay.

248
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,189
Hey!

249
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,514
- What's going on here?
- What do you mean?

250
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,909
- We're just talking.
- About what?

251
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,360
Is something bothering you, Sergeant?

252
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,470
I don't know. Should there be?

253
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,838
If you've got something to say,
why don't you just go ahead and say it?

254
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,153
You're not taking over this ship again.

255
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,839
We've no intentions of doing so.

256
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,876
You're being paranoid.

257
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,550
I know you're up to something.

258
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,108
RUSH: And you have proof of this, do you?

259
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,997
Of course you don't.

260
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,792
Are we done here?

261
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,070
CHLOE: We haven't had any luck yet
figuring out a way home.

262
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,316
God knows if we ever will.

263
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,519
We do have the communication stones.

264
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,194
I was able to use them to go see Mom.

265
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,119
How is she?

266
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,759
Strong. Fragile.

267
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,915
Doing her best, considering.

268
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,676
She's a fighter. Like you.

269
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,428
Sometimes I see you in my dreams,

270
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,275
but they always end the same.

271
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,669
I'm trying to get through this,

272
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,034
but it just gets so...

273
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,873
Hey, one step at a time.

274
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,312
Look at that view.

275
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,074
God, I've never seen anything like it.

276
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,909
I've always dreamed that you would live
a life of adventure. Travel the world.

277
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,753
I know. You told me frequently.

278
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,717
Well, look at you now.

279
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:07,200
Sailing through the universe,
exploring galaxies and planets.

280
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,589
You're living my dream, kiddo.

281
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,112
YOUNG: Hey, what do you got?

282
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,839
The venom we extracted
from the jungle planet creature.

283
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,071
It worked as an anesthetic on Rush
during his surgery.

284
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,549
I think that if I apply it topically
to the tick...

285
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,629
YOUNG: Knock it out,

286
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,709
- give you time to remove it.
- Yeah.

287
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,358
YOUNG: That's great.

288
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,638
Oh, he's coming to.

289
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,119
What happened?

290
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,918
You got a jolt
when we tried to remove the tick.

291
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,672
Relax, just relax.

292
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,029
We're going to try to anesthetize it,

293
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,669
and then I'll try and see
if I can remove it safely, okay?

294
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,188
Okay, let's just take a look here.

295
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,834
It's gone. The tick.

296
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,229
- It just died off?
- JOHANSEN: I don't know.

297
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,672
- Theirs are both still attached.
- Volker, as well?

298
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,591
Could it have jumped?

299
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,797
Yeah, no, I remember.

300
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,990
Gosh, that's so funny,
I feel like that was forever ago.

301
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,155
Hey.

302
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,478
What are you doing?

303
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,793
What's wrong?

304
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,714
Chloe?

305
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,110
- I'm fine.
- Really? 'Cause you don't seem fine.

306
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,918
My father's here.

307
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:01,151
I mean, I... I know he's not here. I'm just...

308
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,471
Just hallucinating?

309
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,029
It's really strange. He's so

310
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,069
real.

311
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,991
- You're seeing him right now?
- Yes.

312
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,878
- Where?
- Right beside me.

313
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,193
- Hello, Mr. Wallace.
- He can't hear you.

314
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,753
Okay. Chloe, we've got to
get you to the infirmary,

315
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,398
just have T.J. take a look...

316
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,916
No, I already know what's wrong.
There's a tick on me.

317
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,752
Matt and his team picked them up
on the last planet.

318
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,752
- One must have jumped to me somehow...
- Wait a minute. What?

319
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,035
An alien tick? Are you kidding me?

320
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,998
T.J. thinks it might inject some
kind of toxin that causes people to...

321
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,230
- Look, we have to go. Chloe...
- No! No, wait!

322
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,151
- It doesn't hurt.
- That's not the point...

323
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,514
And he's not hurting me either.

324
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,512
He? You mean your imaginary father?

325
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,797
I'm not crazy. I know what's going on.

326
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,599
I know that he's not real, but I can't...

327
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,874
I'm not ready to lose him again, okay?

328
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,356
You can't let that thing stay on you.

329
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,795
I know, okay? I know.

330
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:25,078
Just humor me, all right?
Give me some time.

331
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,150
I'll go see T.J. soon, I promise,

332
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,078
but for now, just don't tell anyone, okay?

333
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,593
Please, Eli.

334
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,436
Okay, Sergeant, I've...

335
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,272
Help! Help!

336
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,477
I don't see anything. You're clear, too.

337
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,595
What happened to it?

338
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,999
Listen, I want you to go back
to your quarters,

339
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,069
- and stay there until...
- No.

340
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,275
Just a precaution. Make sure nothing...

341
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,873
- I need to be here.
- Cole can take over for you.

342
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,076
No, Colonel, please, I'm fine.

343
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,673
Look, we'll check ourselves periodically,

344
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,877
and if I start having
any hallucinations, then...

345
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,875
Chloe. She was in here earlier.

346
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,552
I'll go find her.

347
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,068
Ready?

348
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,909
Okay?

349
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,034
Colonel Young, come in.

350
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,515
Colonel Young, do you read?

351
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,795
Eli.

352
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,953
- Hey. Are you okay? I heard you...
- I'm fine. Have you seen Chloe?

353
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,189
Eli?

354
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,275
Yeah.

355
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,789
- Matt.
- Hey.

356
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,199
I need you to come with me
to the infirmary.

357
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:13,478
There's a chance that the tick
that was on me jumped to you.

358
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,275
Have you been seeing any weird things?

359
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,395
No.

360
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,472
- I'm fine...
- Chloe.

361
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,356
- She's seeing her dad.
- CHLOE: Eli!

362
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,839
We need to get you to the infirmary.

363
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,717
No, just wait a minute.
I just need a little more time...

364
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,950
We can't risk letting that thing
stay on you.

365
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,713
- Don't leave me. Chloe!
- No. Wait! I'm not...

366
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,789
SCOTT: Come on, Chloe. Chloe?

367
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,472
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- No. No.

368
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,549
SCOTT: Come on. It'll be okay.

369
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,999
Can I help you with something, Sergeant?

370
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,591
You can start by wiping that smile off
your face.

371
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,079
What smile?

372
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,879
I'd appreciate you not telling lies about me
to Colonel Young.

373
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,875
Lies?

374
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,474
Telling him that I was in the Gate Room,
messing with the consoles.

375
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,348
I don't know what kind of game
you're playing, Sergeant, but...

376
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,152
What are you doing?

377
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,313
There it is.

378
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,759
I don't know why you have to remove it.

379
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,197
- It's not hurting me.
- You don't know that.

380
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,428
It's making you hallucinate.
Who knows what else it's doing?

381
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,669
It's too dangerous to leave in place.

382
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,673
Guys, this discussion needs to end now.
Let's... Let's remove it.

383
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,638
Tell your mother that I love her. I miss her.

384
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,278
I love you, Daddy.

385
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,516
ARMSTRONG: I love you, too, sweetheart.

386
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,273
You're living our dream. Remember that.

387
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,355
GREER:
Colonel Young, come in.

388
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,429
Go ahead, Sergeant.

389
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,670
Colonel Young, we have a problem.

390
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,069
The civilians are trying
to take over the ship again.

391
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,549
- What?
- I'm pursuing Rush.

392
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,871
He and Wray are actively trying
to seize control of the ship.

393
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,837
Now, I don't know who else
is working with them, sir,

394
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,434
but we need to mobilize now.

395
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,717
Sergeant, I need you to listen to me.
Do not do anything. I will talk to them.

396
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,199
Permission to use deadly force.

397
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,474
What? No. Did you hear what I said?

398
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,154
I need you to stand down.
Do not do anything.

399
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,154
YOUNG: Permission granted.

400
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,515
Use whatever force necessary
to stop them.

401
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,919
Copy that.

402
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,917
Sergeant, we don't know
if these channels have been compromised.

403
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,718
Go to radio silence.

404
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,793
Yes, sir.

405
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,799
Greer, acknowledge. I said stand down.

406
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,955
ELI: You think
he might be hallucinating, too?

407
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,508
How? All the ticks
have been accounted for.

408
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,798
Unless there was more than one tick
on each of you when you guys got back.

409
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,393
- Go find Greer.
- Yes, sir.

410
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,675
YOUNG: We need to examine
everyone on this ship.

411
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,513
- Quarantine anyone who's clear.
- Yes, sir.

412
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,112
Sergeant Greer.

413
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,955
I know you're in here, Rush.

414
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,878
Show yourself!

415
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,189
WRAY: No!

416
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,354
What are you doing? Open that door!

417
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,034
You're not taking over the ship again.

418
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,549
SCOTT:
Colonel Young, come in.

419
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,073
Go ahead, Scott.

420
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,994
No sign of Greer.
Still not responding to any radio calls.

421
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,115
Well, keep at it.

422
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,998
Sir, Rush and Wray
are also unaccounted for.

423
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,277
No one knows where they are.
Rush isn't responding to his radio, either.

424
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,232
All right.
I'll put a few more details together.

425
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,832
- T.J.
- Excuse me.

426
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:54,476
So, listen, I got to go help look for Greer.
You going to be okay?

427
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,788
Yeah, fine.

428
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,348
But if you feel any different,
you see anything out of the usual...

429
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,353
No, believe me,
I'm as concerned about this as you are.

430
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,238
- Okay. Fine, but keep me posted.
- Yeah.

431
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,469
Thanks.

432
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,630
ELI: More than one tick
attached to you would explain

433
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,199
why some of the hallucinations

434
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,795
were more intense than others.

435
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,352
The toxins,
maybe they target the limbic system.

436
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:22,355
It's the area of the brain
that's responsible for emotion.

437
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,079
So, fear, anger, remorse...

438
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,916
Matt's guilt over his son.

439
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,513
Claustrophobia.

440
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,828
My dad.

441
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,475
Let me guess, issue with snakes?

442
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,908
And you?

443
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,158
Listen to me.
I can't stop the bleeding.

444
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,277
You have to open that door.
If I don't get medical attention...

445
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,873
Yes, Colonel.

446
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,516
No, sir, I do not know
who else is involved in the mutiny.

447
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,750
She's refusing to cooperate.

448
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,513
You're not talking to anyone.

449
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,716
Your radio is off!
What is the matter with you?

450
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,519
Yes, I will continue the interrogation,

451
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:13,196
but at some point, sir, we are just
better off ending this once and for all.

452
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,355
Sergeant. Sergeant, listen to me.

453
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,118
Sergeant Greer!

454
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,274
We are not taking over the ship!

455
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,352
What do you got?

456
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,919
Can't get the door open.
Must have been disabled from the inside.

457
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,037
I heard Wray's voice.

458
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,478
- Camile? It's Lieutenant Scott!
- Scott, help!

459
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,637
I'm wounded!
Sergeant Greer has got us hostage...

460
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,914
Shut...

461
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,679
Quiet, now.

462
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,996
Sergeant Greer, it's Lieutenant Scott!
Stand down!

463
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,877
- Colonel Young. This is Scott, come in.
- YOUNG: Yeah.

464
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,999
We found him. He has locked himself
and Wray in one of the storage rooms.

465
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,559
I think he's holding her hostage.

466
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,719
That's it.

467
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,558
I'm done with you.

468
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,074
Please.

469
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,313
Sergeant, don't.

470
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,428
Do it.

471
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,713
I said do it.

472
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,678
Colonel Young.

473
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,832
Colonel, we got them.

474
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,557
Send T.J. We have wounded in here.

475
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,591
- How you doing?
- Okay.

476
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,796
JOHANSEN: I was able to stop the bleeding
and stitch the wound,

477
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,714
so we'll keep an eye out for infection,
but she should be okay.

478
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,158
- The rest of the crew?
- I checked everyone.

479
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,310
It looks like we got them all, so...

480
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,915
Hopefully things will get back to normal
around here.

481
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,638
Whatever that is.

482
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,153
Am I gonna be all right?

483
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,717
No, I'm not gonna be all right

484
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,229
Nothing is all right now

485
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,630
Am I gonna see the sun come up?

486
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,472
Or am I going down?

487
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,755
'Cause every day I'm here

488
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,355
All I feel is sheer agony

489
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,679
Friends telling me

490
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:38,232
That maybe I need some psychiatric help

491
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:47,310
Yeah, they're always so quick to tell you

492
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,198
Just how to get on with it

493
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,191
But I look into the mirror

494
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:56,910
And all I see is ancient fear and agony

495
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,913
What do we got?

496
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,595
Well, the atmosphere is good.

497
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,196
Ten hours on the countdown.

498
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,111
Shall we send a team?

499
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,075
Yeah.

500
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,156
Our luck's got to change at some point.

501
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,310
Just remember the bug spray.

502
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,993
Scott, this is Young.

503
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,799
Get a team ready. You're going offworld.
