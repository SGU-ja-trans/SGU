00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,072
RUSH: This is what Destiny intended from
the moment it entered the star system.

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,190
YOUNG: We are going to survive.
We are going to make it home.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,710
I'm telling you,
the ship came here for a reason!

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,949
RUSH: Destiny is powered
by the stars themselves.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,435
WRAY: He and Young
are bumping heads, yes.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,556
Not sure which camp is the better choice.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,194
YOUNG: We just pretend
nothing happened?

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,596
We need to be ready
for the next encounter.

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,515
For the sake of the crew.

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,793
For the sake of the crew.

11
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,598
YOUNG ON RADIO: What do we got,
Colonel, Lucian Alliance?

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,830
CARTER: That would be my guess.
They haven't introduced themselves.

13
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,036
Any word on how they gained intel
on our base?

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,953
No. What about casualties?

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,317
CARTER: Twelve. Eighty-plus MIA.

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,949
I'm pregnant.

17
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,594
It's yours.

18
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,069
Ours.

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,431
Look, I know that we've had
our differences in the past.

20
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,669
- Yeah.
- It was my duty

21
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,399
to express concern for how
everyone else felt about you.

22
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,429
I've never even met your wife.

23
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,552
Telford, you connected with him.

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,030
This is a residual memory of his that
somehow transferred to my subconscious?

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,000
I would think you'd be doing everything
possible to get these people home,

26
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,674
to get yourself home, back to your wife.

27
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,473
And I know you're still sleeping with her.

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,749
Everett!

29
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,758
- You're up late.
- Yeah.

30
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,359
I just had a very interesting dream.

31
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,112
Everyone thinks
their dreams are interesting.

32
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,519
Nobody else cares.

33
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,276
Yeah, well, you're going to care
about this one.

34
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,834
I'm outside a warehouse, on Earth.

35
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,109
And there's birds.

36
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,191
At least I can hear them. Seagulls, I think.

37
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,955
I'm at some kind of meeting.

38
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,312
There's four or five people there.

39
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,628
- Who?
- I don't know.

40
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,233
I don't know,
but I'm giving them information.

41
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,556
Reports, files.

42
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,672
I'm talking about Icarus.

43
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,029
In detail.

44
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,719
Well, who were they?

45
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,835
I don't know, I...

46
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,711
They had a Goa'uld cargo ship.

47
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,269
- The Lucian Alliance on Earth?
- I can only guess.

48
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,349
You dreamt you were the spy

49
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,998
who leaked everything about Icarus
to the Lucian Alliance?

50
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,798
No, no, no, not me. It wasn't me.

51
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,029
Rush, what the hell are you talking about?

52
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,714
On the way back to the car,
I see my reflection.

53
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,638
It's Colonel Telford.

54
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,391
I was Colonel Telford.

55
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,111
YOUNG: Rush switched with him
two days ago.

56
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,710
The only reason I am telling you is
because you are the only person

57
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,950
who's ever experienced
this kind of bleed-through memory

58
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,234
after using the stones.

59
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,039
It was just that once, sir.
Certainly nothing like that.

60
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,389
Thanks, Lieutenant.

61
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,593
All right. Look, sir,

62
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,237
I understand that you have your issues
with Colonel Telford,

63
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,470
- but you cannot seriously...
- Sit down, Lieutenant.

64
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,836
Before he was assigned to Icarus,
Telford spent the better part of a year

65
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,797
undercover, infiltrating the Alliance.

66
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,592
You really think he would turn?

67
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,716
Eight months into his assignment,

68
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,869
there was an attack on a planet

69
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,713
that we had a large team working on,
P2S 569.

70
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,075
Thirty-seven people were killed.

71
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,674
Now, we later found out
that Telford knew about the attack

72
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,557
and decided to do nothing.

73
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,391
In order to protect his cover.

74
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,799
That's what he said.

75
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,632
Stargate Command let him off the hook,

76
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,517
and everything was
swept under the carpet.

77
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,713
- But now...
- Sir, there's got to be more to it than that.

78
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,189
We know that the Goa'uld
had brainwashing technology,

79
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,748
could make a man turn against his mother
and be proud of it.

80
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,238
It is possible that the Alliance
now has that capability.

81
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,955
Well, if they do, sir,
then we can't trust anyone.

82
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,630
ELI: Colonel, hey. We were just going over
some of the data we found...

83
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,278
Take a break, Eli.

84
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,514
- Secrets, you two...
- Now, please, go.

85
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,238
Okay.

86
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,354
So I talked to Scott.

87
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,237
He doesn't remember
anything like your dream.

88
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,232
Well, we have to do something.

89
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,435
Agreed.

90
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,950
Telford's still on active rotation
with the stones, yeah?

91
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,712
Mmm-hmm.

92
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,075
He's due to make a connection
in a couple of days with Dr. Morrison.

93
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,273
What if I take Morrison's place?

94
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,349
And do what?

95
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,473
Try to make contact with the Alliance.

96
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,834
It's risky.

97
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,037
It's a pretty good disguise, actually
being inside someone else's body.

98
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,193
- I'll go.
- No, that would be a mistake.

99
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,077
- Why's that?
- Because I had the dream.

100
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,590
Look, there's still elements
I'm trying to piece together.

101
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,750
For example, there's a number, 3-1-4.

102
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,354
Now, I know that's significant,
but I don't know why.

103
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,551
If I'm there,
in Telford's environment, then...

104
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,993
You're not trained for this.

105
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,159
Well, who is?

106
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,951
I'll just have to do my best.

107
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,190
If Stargate Command
is this badly compromised,

108
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,430
I can't tell anyone what you're up to,
do you understand that?

109
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,158
- Yup.
- Once you are on Earth,

110
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,389
- you are on your own.
- I understand.

111
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,072
- No back-up...
- I get it, I get it.

112
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,991
But someone has to stop this guy.

113
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,433
He can't be allowed to continue.

114
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,318
The Alliance probably already know
more about this ship than we do.

115
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,356
- Which isn't much.
- Well, I wouldn't underestimate them.

116
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,634
I'm not.

117
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,189
WRAY: Colonel, I need a minute.

118
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,633
That's about all I got right now.

119
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,757
Did you bump Dr. Morrison from his spot
on the communication stones?

120
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,193
- Yes.
- Without consulting me?

121
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,429
- Yes.
- Any particular reason?

122
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,748
Yes.

123
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,558
- You care to enlighten me?
- No.

124
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,510
With everything
that we have been through,

125
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,635
you really want to do this?

126
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,029
Look, Camile, I've got good reason
not to tell you, or I would.

127
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,678
You're going to have to trust me.

128
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,919
GRAHAM: Dr. Morrison?

129
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,755
Yes.

130
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,989
Welcome back.

131
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,275
I'm Staff Sergeant Graham.
I'll be your escort.

132
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,789
Right.

133
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,991
I want to talk to Colonel Young, now.

134
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,516
He is busy at the moment, sir,
but he said he'd come and see you shortly.

135
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,637
Why was I connected with Dr. Rush?
That wasn't part of the schedule.

136
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,872
Yes, sorry about that, sir.
It was unavoidable.

137
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,949
Why?

138
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,151
Dr. Rush had to consult
with some people back on Earth

139
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,117
regarding some technical problems.

140
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,152
You're a terrible liar, Lieutenant.

141
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,071
I'd like some fatigues.

142
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,759
No problem. This way, sir.

143
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,274
I need to speak to General O'Neill
immediately.

144
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,998
- And you are?
- Colonel Everett Young,

145
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,878
authentication 1-6-1-9-4-1-4.
Tell him it's urgent.

146
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,755
Everett, I'll have you know I'm missing
a national security briefing for this.

147
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,353
Sorry about that, sir.

148
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,670
Well, if you'd ever been
to a national security briefing,

149
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,193
you wouldn't say that.

150
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,076
- What's up?
- It's Dr. Rush, sir.

151
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,276
He's on Earth right now
in the body of Colonel Telford.

152
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,679
Probably hasn't even left the building.

153
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,513
- So?
- We need to put a tail on him.

154
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,669
Well, he's got an escort.

155
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,830
He'll ditch the escort first chance he gets.

156
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,717
I think we should let him do it,
then follow him discreetly.

157
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,712
- Why?
- He's about to try and make contact

158
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,153
with the Lucian Alliance.

159
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,878
Oh, Chloe...

160
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,390
- Oh, my God.
- MAN: What is it?

161
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,918
Chloe, I didn't know you could sew.

162
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,228
Oh, no, I can't.

163
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,313
Not really.

164
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,833
I hope it doesn't fall apart.

165
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,070
No, it's beautiful.

166
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,593
- Thank you.
- CHLOE: You're welcome.

167
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,669
Here, open this one.

168
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,748
Hey, can we talk to you for a second?

169
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,188
Oh, my gosh.

170
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,799
You made this yourself?

171
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,913
If it's a girl, I can make something else.

172
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,993
- No, it's perfect. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

173
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,752
- What's going on?
- We're hoping you could tell us.

174
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,875
About Rush.

175
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,791
Going back to Earth
on the stones unscheduled.

176
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,792
Well, I'm sure there's a good reason.

177
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,518
Right, yeah, that's what we're afraid of.

178
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,999
They didn't say anything to you?

179
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,159
Young came in to talk to him
the other day...

180
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,473
They did kick me out.

181
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,879
Yeah, we heard Young went, too.

182
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,915
- He did?
- After Rush. He's there right now.

183
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,672
Something's definitely going on here.

184
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,109
TELFORD: Congratulations, T.J.

185
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,478
Camile, if I could have a moment
of your time, please?

186
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,549
Mmm-hmm.

187
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,389
TELFORD: Were you aware of the change...

188
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,674
Yeah, we could check those...

189
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,239
...control interface room
probably has something...

190
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,515
Yeah, I could meet you guys at the...

191
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,749
- That'd be great.
- Sure.

192
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,752
JOHANSEN: And the wrapping paper.
Where'd you get this?

193
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,239
If I'm not mistaken, sir,
I believe you've witnessed

194
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,470
the effects of this brainwashing technology
first hand.

195
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,108
Yeah.

196
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,395
Yeah, that's true.

197
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,232
I recommend
we keep the number of people

198
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,436
we bring in on this to a minimum.

199
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,909
Well, thank you, Colonel,
for stating the obvious.

200
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,234
Truth is, you took a bit of a chance
by telling me, didn't you?

201
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,719
Well, I had to, sir.

202
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,313
Rush was asking for a free pass,

203
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,391
an unscheduled,
unauthorized visit to Earth,

204
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,710
exactly the sort of thing he might do
if he was the mole himself.

205
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,789
Well, if he's the mole,

206
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,792
why would he be trying to frame Telford
at this point?

207
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,869
I can't answer that, sir.

208
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,279
And if he's telling the truth?

209
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,999
Hopefully, he'll still be able to lead us
to the Alliance.

210
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,679
And not lose his life.

211
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,589
Yes, sir.

212
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,475
RUSH: I've quite a few personal things
to attend to.

213
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,516
- I'll be a few minutes.
- Not to worry, sir.

214
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,715
I came prepared.

215
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,232
TELFORD: So, do you know
what they're going to do to Rush?

216
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,111
WRAY: They didn't let me know
until after the fact.

217
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,348
They're trying to keep me
out of the loop. It's not...

218
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,149
Where the hell have you been?

219
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,639
It's nice to see you, too.

220
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,594
Come with me.
We have some things to discuss.

221
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,589
Do we?

222
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,035
Privately.

223
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,993
We haven't seen you in a while, Colonel.
I hope everything is well.

224
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,517
- I've been on assignment.
- Of course.

225
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,513
I'll give you some privacy.

226
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,189
MAN: Yes?

227
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,998
Yeah, this is Telford.

228
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,116
I have some new information.
We have to meet.

229
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,433
MAN: Stand by for instructions.

230
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,949
Get in.

231
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,677
You're allowing alcohol onboard now?

232
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,591
I doubt I could stop it if I wanted to.

233
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,998
So I can report your command
of this ship is solid as ever, then?

234
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,514
I am doing my best to make it work.

235
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,392
Why did I connect with Rush?

236
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,916
Oh, we'll get to that.
I think we need to clear the air a little bit.

237
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,789
Have another.

238
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,359
I'm on duty. You're on duty.

239
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,271
Yes, and we're both
a billion light years away

240
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,918
from the nearest disciplinary hearing.

241
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,468
So, what, you're afraid of
what you might say?

242
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,595
I don't have anything to hide,
from you or anyone else.

243
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,669
Is that so?

244
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,550
I could've brought you up on charges
for assaulting a fellow officer.

245
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,959
You should just thank me and let it go.

246
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,393
Well, I think we both know that

247
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,311
you don't want the details
of that little incident

248
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,435
getting out any more than I do.

249
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,149
You cheated on your wife,
and she moved on. End of story.

250
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,028
You took advantage
to get back at me on a personal level.

251
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,434
You were sleeping with an officer
under your command!

252
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,629
I mean, look at you, Everett.
You're a disgrace.

253
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,032
But I'm here, right?

254
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,595
And that's what's killing you, isn't it?

255
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,989
Because this
was supposed to be your prize.

256
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,435
Your reward for all that hard work.

257
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,759
An entire year living with those criminals,
thieves, murderers,

258
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,949
pretending to be one of them,
I mean, that's got to take its toll.

259
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,713
I'm not doing this again.

260
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,919
The man I used to know would not let
37 people die to cover his own ass.

261
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,989
So,

262
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,789
what changed?

263
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,713
What happened to you, David?

264
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,149
Thanks for the drink.

265
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,148
Scott...

266
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,595
What are we doing?

267
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,673
We're waiting, what else?

268
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,271
O'NEILL: Daniel, come in. Do you read?

269
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,319
Jack, what is it?

270
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,994
Carter says they're using
some kind of jamming device.

271
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,790
We can't get a lock on anyone in the area.

272
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,029
What's your status?

273
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,076
They've stopped.
Looks like we're waiting on someone.

274
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,991
Well, ground assault is standing by.

275
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,799
They'll move when you call it.

276
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,549
Hang on.

277
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,154
Who are you?

278
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,188
I'm sorry, I don't know what you mean.

279
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,157
All right, who am I?

280
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,358
Whoever you are, you must be using
the Ancient communication stones.

281
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,429
I don't know what you're talking about.

282
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,034
You failed to use the proper code
when you called in.

283
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,758
Colonel Telford would never make
such a mistake.

284
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,076
His cover's blown. Move in. Move in now.

285
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,629
They have a ship.

286
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,589
BLACK OPS LEADER: Go! Go!

287
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,635
Yeah. We're too late.

288
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,909
CHLOE: You okay?

289
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,829
Yeah,

290
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,149
I'm fine.

291
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,196
What chance does this baby have
of ever living a normal life?

292
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,673
What's normal anyway?

293
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,070
I don't know, but I don't think it's this.

294
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,074
Look, I know right now
it seems impossible

295
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,752
that we will ever make it back.

296
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,319
But I also know that
since we've been here,

297
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,870
it seems like we're averaging about
five impossible things a week, right?

298
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,797
So why assume the worst?

299
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,595
Look, at the very least,

300
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,229
there are a lot of people here
who are going to care about that baby.

301
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,679
That's something.

302
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,549
Yeah.

303
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,311
We are all going to help you.

304
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,469
Thanks, Chloe.

305
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,835
Come here.

306
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,516
According to our intelligence,
her name is Kiva.

307
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,114
She's the daughter of
a Lucian Alliance warlord named Massin,

308
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,154
one of the higher-ups. Powerful and brutal.

309
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,514
That intel come from Telford?

310
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,511
Yeah, well, at least
we know who the mole is, eh?

311
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,034
There's an easy way to end this.
We cut the connection on the stones.

312
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,109
They get Telford back,

313
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,156
we're no closer to figuring out
what they're up to.

314
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,559
Dr. Rush's life is in danger.

315
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,959
He volunteered. He knew the risks.

316
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,832
That cargo ship
slipped past all of our sensors.

317
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,148
We have no idea where it's going.

318
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,798
Telford might, and he may know more.

319
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,152
I'm just asking for the chance
to get it out of him.

320
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,032
He still has rights, doesn't he?

321
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,436
He didn't say how he was going to do it.

322
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,238
With all due respect, sir,
you and I both know

323
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,993
the people who made the rules
were not prepared for anything like this.

324
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,469
KIVA: I'm sorry.

325
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,273
I know that really hurts.

326
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,838
RUSH: Well, I suppose it was worth it.

327
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,879
I had to make it look good.

328
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,992
Of course, I didn't give them the code
on purpose.

329
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,399
I'm not a complete idiot.

330
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,549
KIVA: On purpose?

331
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,198
What are you talking about?

332
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,236
They were getting suspicious.

333
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,515
Yes, I was beginning to have
concerns about that myself.

334
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,638
Well, that's why I had to come in.

335
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,152
I wasn't sure
whether I was being followed.

336
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,476
I figured if they thought
I was being taken by force,

337
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,754
it might help us salvage something
from this operation.

338
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,994
Nice try.

339
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,878
You almost managed
to make that sound convincing.

340
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,078
Well, it sounds convincing
because it's true.

341
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,030
If you really are Colonel Telford,

342
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,511
you'll know my name.

343
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,233
It's Kiva.

344
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,149
Good.

345
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,795
Next question.

346
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,829
What's yours?

347
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,029
A spy?

348
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,912
A Lucian Alliance spy?

349
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,511
You are so desperate to get back at me

350
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,511
that you would say or do anything,
wouldn't you?

351
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,589
We have proof.

352
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,910
Oh, come on, Everett,
this is all about me and Emily.

353
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,752
Well, how do you think
I found out about that?

354
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,231
You switched bodies with Scott,
do you remember that?

355
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,629
Yeah.

356
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,233
He's the one who told me.

357
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,789
He saw it, in his mind, a vision.

358
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,836
Call it residual memory,
whatever you want.

359
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,917
It seems that every time
you use the stones,

360
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,752
you leave a little something behind.

361
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,915
Maybe... Maybe that's guilt.

362
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,036
Maybe, deep down inside,
you want the truth to come out.

363
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,233
You're insane.

364
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,355
You've already confessed.

365
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,592
You just won't admit it.

366
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,159
We'll let him sweat a while.

367
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,279
GREER: Give me a shot, sir.

368
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,429
Won't take long.

369
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,988
Appreciate the enthusiasm, Sergeant.
Not yet.

370
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,470
I'd really prefer not to have to do this.

371
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,519
I wish I had time to convince you
that I'm not what you think I am.

372
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,549
Oh, yeah, and what's that?

373
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,597
I'm a reasonable person just trying to do
what's right for my people.

374
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,398
You make a terrible first impression.

375
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,551
We have brainwashing technologies.

376
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,629
I could try those, but I'm not sure what
they'd do to you under the circumstances,

377
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,151
with your consciousness
in somebody else's body.

378
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,874
Unfortunately, I've learned one thing
about torture over the years.

379
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,837
It's effective.

380
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,196
Barbaric, I know,
and I hate lowering myself to this level,

381
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,791
but I need to know who you are,

382
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,678
and beyond that,
whether or not you're any use to me.

383
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,431
Has he been given any food or water?

384
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,829
YOUNG: Open it.

385
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,069
Sir, maybe I should go in there with you...

386
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,196
No, no,
that will not be necessary, Lieutenant.

387
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,430
This is on me, only me. Open it.

388
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,313
You can't keep me in here forever.

389
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,550
No one's pulling the plug
on the stones, so...

390
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,710
Why don't you just admit what you did,
and we can move on?

391
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,195
I want to talk to Scott.
I have a right to face my accuser.

392
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,077
Oh, this didn't come from Scott.

393
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,879
You switched with Rush, remember?

394
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,189
Rush?

395
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,998
This is coming from Rush?

396
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,638
At first, I didn't believe him, either.

397
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,913
I figured I'd give him enough rope
to hang himself, but guess what?

398
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,909
That didn't happen.

399
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,876
- What's that?
- Airman Dunning brought it along

400
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,679
with his personal effects.
Do you recognize them?

401
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,316
They were all stationed on Icarus.
The fire suppression team.

402
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,836
They got trapped during the attack
when a corridor collapsed.

403
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,593
They all burned alive,
every last one of them.

404
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,750
No, no, no, no. No, no.

405
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,308
You take a good look.

406
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,469
Take a look.

407
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,710
I want you to look at their faces,
because you killed them.

408
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,878
You killed them as if you'd doused them
with gasoline and lit the match yourself,

409
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,916
and they weren't the only ones.

410
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,151
So we know that you are
a traitor and a murderer.

411
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,194
Now we know you're a coward, too.

412
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,279
SCOTT: All right, that's enough!

413
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,076
Stand down, Sergeant! I said stand down!

414
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,917
YOUNG: Get out, both of you!
SCOTT: Sir...

415
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,149
Get out!

416
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,349
Okay.

417
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,909
So,

418
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,629
where were we?

419
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,637
This will eventually kill you.

420
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,039
You'll be killing Telford, too.

421
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,509
That might just work out for the best
given that he's been compromised.

422
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,591
I have a full rundown
of the personnel aboard Destiny

423
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,599
and I doubt very much that civilians
or the scientists would have endured this,

424
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,999
so the question is

425
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,878
whether or not Colonel Young would
have put himself in this situation,

426
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,276
or sent his first lieutenant, Scott?

427
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,354
How do you know
I'm someone aboard Destiny?

428
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,838
That's a fair question.

429
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,318
You can make this stop.

430
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,989
If I answer your question,

431
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,116
you're going to kill me.

432
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,713
Either way I'm dead.

433
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,829
KIVA: I won't.

434
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,913
You have my word.

435
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,993
You have nothing to lose.

436
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,354
Rush!

437
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,513
I'm Dr. Nicholas Rush.

438
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,356
I want this connection cut.
I want to go back to my own body.

439
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,431
No, you don't. You're damaged goods.
You go back now,

440
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,750
your friends at the Alliance
aren't going to be too happy with you.

441
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,512
I don't have any friends in the Alliance.

442
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,999
Not anymore you don't.

443
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,348
Your only hope is with us.

444
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,556
You come clean now,
I will do my best to help you.

445
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,598
I am not a spy, Everett!
How many times do I have to tell you?

446
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,953
Recognize it?

447
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,389
Should I?

448
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,515
It's your work.

449
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,274
To do with dialing the ninth chevron
that leads to Destiny.

450
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,995
These readings...

451
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,752
Similar naquadria deposits.

452
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,037
We had some issues
adapting the equations,

453
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,951
but there should be enough power
to get us there.

454
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,476
You've found another Icarus planet.

455
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,993
Let's talk about the outpost. P2S 569.

456
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,753
We've been through this.
I was cleared of any wrongdoing.

457
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,114
Because they didn't have all the facts.

458
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,358
I couldn't blow my cover.
I didn't have a choice!

459
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,753
Remember that little combat engineer,
Sanchez?

460
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,031
Remember her? She used to follow you
around like a puppy.

461
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,838
She was hit in the first blast.

462
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,879
Right arm severed at the shoulder.

463
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,838
She's screaming, yelling,
begging me to help her.

464
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,040
All I can do is watch her
bleed to death in the dirt.

465
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,473
It wasn't my fault.

466
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,471
Now, we already know you did it,

467
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,276
but it's possible you're not responsible.

468
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,031
- What are you talking about?
- Think about it.

469
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,509
I want you to think about it.

470
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,672
Why is it that the memory transfer
happens only with you and only you

471
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,273
and no one else when they use the stones?

472
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,632
They messed with your head, David.

473
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,116
They made you think
that you were one of them, and you're not.

474
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,715
That's not you.

475
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,189
Now, we can help you,
we can bring you back,

476
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,078
but I need you to take the first step.

477
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,669
You tell us where they're taking Rush.

478
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,869
David?

479
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,749
Tell me.

480
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,757
KIVA: We've replicated it as best we could.

481
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,709
Olan!

482
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,191
Meet Dr. Rush.

483
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,389
Doctor.

484
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,948
Olan is one of our lead scientists
working on the project.

485
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,758
OLAN: Your work is impressive.

486
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,751
It was nothing, really.

487
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,432
When I found out
that you were on your way...

488
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,036
Yes, we're all very excited to have
Dr. Rush's full cooperation.

489
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,350
Maybe now
we'll actually make a connection.

490
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:32,158
As you can see, we've procured
some familiar technology.

491
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,073
It was necessary
to implement your methods.

492
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,953
I trust it will suffice?

493
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,708
I'll leave you to your work.

494
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,471
The figures for these naquadria deposits
are correct, yes?

495
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,869
- Of course.
- Because if they're out even by a fraction...

496
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,030
We spent months
doing a detailed orbital survey.

497
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,315
We mapped every deposit
down to the last vein.

498
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,472
All right, then, I'm done.

499
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,389
Really?

500
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,278
It's not that difficult
when you know what you're doing.

501
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,317
- But...
- I'm kidding.

502
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,796
This is probably going to take some time.

503
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,229
Oh.

504
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,955
Of course.

505
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,635
Quite possibly the rest of my life.

506
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,315
Huh.

507
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,320
Lieutenant, there's a lot of talk
around the ship

508
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,879
about what's going on in that room.

509
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,757
This is a military matter, ma'am.

510
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,319
It doesn't concern you.

511
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,038
That's exactly the kind of talk
that forced us

512
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,556
to try and take control
of this ship once before, Sergeant.

513
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,318
Camile...

514
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,278
Do you want the rumors to spread,
or do you want to do something about it?

515
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,396
It'll be over soon enough,
that is all you need to know.

516
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,550
See, that's the wrong answer.

517
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,599
Come on, Lieutenant.

518
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,877
Something tells me that you do not want
this on your conscience.

519
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,119
Better be careful.

520
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,714
Whatever it is, we all have to live with it.

521
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,517
I need to communicate
with Stargate Command.

522
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,272
- Do we let him out...
- Nobody in or out.

523
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,475
That is an order.

524
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,199
I want to talk to him. Colonel!

525
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,075
Progress?

526
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,316
- None yet.
- You must be joking.

527
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,435
You're stalling.

528
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,670
Well, if you want to blow yourselves up,
you go right ahead.

529
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,113
You along with us.

530
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,998
This is going to take time,
and I don't just mean a few hours.

531
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,276
But Olan said we've been close
for months now.

532
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,069
I assumed that with your help,
we'd be able to...

533
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:45,233
Look, with all due respect to Olan here,
his work is shoddy at best.

534
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,469
I'm sorry, you're just going to have to
trust me on this one.

535
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,560
The whole thing's a bloody mess.
I may have to start from scratch.

536
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,751
You call yourself reasonable?

537
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,955
I am.

538
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,439
You said he was incompetent.

539
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,188
I was stalling.

540
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,159
You were right.

541
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,754
I shouldn't have to demonstrate
how important this is to me,

542
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,476
to all of us, Dr. Rush.

543
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,112
No more chances.

544
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,909
VOLKER: Now what's happening?

545
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,554
We're not sure.

546
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,756
Young's been back and forth
on the stones all day.

547
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,675
ELI: Looks like this time
he brought someone back with him.

548
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,914
Who is it?

549
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,756
Welcome to the Destiny, General.

550
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,834
- Hello.
- Sir.

551
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,078
- Corporal?
- Sorry about that, sir.

552
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,229
This way.

553
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,589
Sir.

554
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,274
Who's this?

555
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,113
General O'Neill.

556
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,239
It's really him.

557
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,399
Okay. Let's say it's true.

558
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,239
General, I'm being held without charge.

559
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,276
I've been denied counsel,
and one of his men attacked me.

560
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,634
YOUNG: David, he knows.

561
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,194
He authorized it.

562
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,079
Well, maybe not that last part there.

563
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,277
This is what I've been trying to tell you.

564
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,912
O'NEILL: Time to come clean, son.

565
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,790
YOUNG: We need to know
where they've taken Rush.

566
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,311
TELFORD: You checked out
that gate address I gave you?

567
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,391
Oh, yeah. Dead end.

568
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,956
You didn't think
I'd give you anything real, did you?

569
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,518
You should see your face.

570
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,150
You look so surprised.

571
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,198
Actually, I'm disappointed.

572
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,191
You may not believe this,
but I was actually holding out hope

573
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,192
that it might not be true,
that there was some other explanation.

574
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,069
It doesn't matter.

575
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,798
You can't stop it.

576
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,996
Stop what?

577
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,469
Here you go.

578
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,348
I wouldn't say it was good.

579
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,628
What's it like?

580
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,480
I mean, we've heard descriptions,
but what's it like being there?

581
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,595
On Destiny?

582
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,037
You've flown around in spaceships before.

583
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,473
VARRO: Not an Ancient ship.

584
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,630
Not that far out
into the unknown universe.

585
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,355
Well, it's a rust bucket, what can I tell you?

586
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,319
I can't wait to see it for myself.

587
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,036
What if I can't do it?

588
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,638
What if we just fail to make a connection?

589
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,388
Kiva promised she wouldn't kill you.
Her word is good.

590
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,759
I'll have to kill you myself.

591
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,159
You think I was brainwashed?

592
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,154
I came to my senses.

593
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,078
We freed billions of people

594
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,391
from thousands of years of slavery
all over our galaxy,

595
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,919
and then we patted ourselves on the back

596
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,991
and left them with little
or no means for survival.

597
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,798
What the hell did we think
was going to happen?

598
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,869
YOUNG: This isn't you, David.

599
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,473
Wake up, Everett!

600
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,989
You think the Lucian Alliance
are just a bunch of criminals?

601
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,472
Who made us judge and jury?

602
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,073
People will do what they have to do
to survive.

603
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,673
You should know that by now.

604
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,279
We take whatever we want.

605
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,394
We do whatever is good for us
regardless of the impact on other planets!

606
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,677
What makes us so special?

607
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,390
I know what makes me special.

608
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,513
This is not our ship.

609
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,878
It wasn't intended for us.

610
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,155
Where are they taking Rush?

611
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,800
It was supposed to be
for the benefit of all mankind.

612
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,633
Wow. He's more far gone
than I thought, General.

613
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,309
Yeah, I've heard enough.

614
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,758
Should probably take it
to the next level, sir.

615
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,912
Go ahead and do what you need to do.

616
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,679
Communications Room, this is Young.

617
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,069
- Please cut the General's connection.
- Yes, sir.

618
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,599
- Sir.
- Dismissed, Corporal.

619
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,638
WRAY: Okay, this has gone on long enough.

620
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,836
- You have to cut the connection.
- I can't do that.

621
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,638
Dr. Rush's life is in danger.

622
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,917
That's more important than getting
any intel on the Lucian Alliance!

623
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,838
I just thought maybe we'd be better off
if she knew, sir.

624
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,115
Control Room, this is Young.

625
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,074
This is Brody.

626
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,435
YOUNG: Can you bring up the life
support controls for this section?

627
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,349
BRODY: I got it.

628
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,398
Begin venting the atmosphere
in Colonel Telford's quarters now.

629
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,469
- What?
- SCOTT: Sir?

630
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,759
Say again?

631
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,308
Begin venting
Colonel Telford's quarters now.

632
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,789
- What the hell are you doing?
- Camile, stay out of this.

633
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,358
He can't do this!

634
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,988
- Lieutenant!
- I...

635
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,513
David!

636
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,153
David, can you hear me?

637
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,954
It's got to be a bluff.

638
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,399
To scare him.

639
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,831
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

640
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,469
ELI: Look, you can't...

641
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,556
David, I'm venting the atmosphere
in your room!

642
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,510
You've got five minutes
before you die of suffocation.

643
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,358
Your only hope is
to tell me the location of the Alliance base.

644
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,793
TELFORD: You're bluffing!

645
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,069
Kill me, and you kill Rush!

646
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,596
I know, but right now,
I'm thinking of the greater good.

647
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,829
So what's it going to be?

648
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,428
Young!

649
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,153
Open this damn door!

650
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,518
We both know you're not going to kill me.
