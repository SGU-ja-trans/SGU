1
00:00:02,051 --> 00:00:05,020
<i>This is what Destiny intended from
the moment it entered the star system.</i>

2
00:00:05,588 --> 00:00:08,386
<i>That ship is the best chance
we have of getting home.</i>

3
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:11,225
- Are we done?
- We'll never be done.

4
00:00:12,094 --> 00:00:14,063
<i>You shouldn't have left him
on the planet.</i>

5
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:15,257
<i>You think I don't know that?</i>

6
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:19,461
<i>Everyone thinks we're safe.
They think that they'll never find us again.</i>

7
00:00:19,536 --> 00:00:21,470
Why did you take one
of our people prisoner?

8
00:00:23,206 --> 00:00:24,537
<i>We're not safe, are we?</i>

9
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,405
They're coming.
Who's coming?

10
00:00:26,476 --> 00:00:28,239
<i>The Lucian Alliance,
they're coming to take Destiny.</i>

11
00:00:28,312 --> 00:00:30,109
<i>There's only one way
this is gonna end if we wait.</i>

12
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,579
<i>I'm not
surrendering this ship.</i>

13
00:00:32,684 --> 00:00:34,015
<i>I don't know
if you've met Ginn.</i>

14
00:00:34,085 --> 00:00:36,315
<i>Homeworld Security wants
to talk to her now.</i>

15
00:00:36,387 --> 00:00:37,820
About the planned attack on Earth?

16
00:00:37,956 --> 00:00:41,187
I want you to walk with me,
side by side, for the benefit of everyone.

17
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:44,523
Okay, so, what are we talking about,
some kind of code, a... a message?

18
00:00:44,595 --> 00:00:46,586
We're all sitting here, ready.
- Ready for what?

19
00:00:46,664 --> 00:00:48,825
Nothing that concerns you.

20
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:51,294
- We need to talk.
- I'm sorry?

21
00:00:51,502 --> 00:00:53,403
I'm Dr. Amanda Perry. I...

22
00:00:53,472 --> 00:00:55,838
<i>I've thought a lot
about seeing you again.</i>

23
00:00:56,008 --> 00:00:57,168
This time is different.

24
00:00:57,242 --> 00:01:02,043
Sometimes with the stones it's easy
to forget you're in another person's body.

25
00:01:09,154 --> 00:01:10,553
<i>How can you
just forgive him?</i>

26
00:01:11,357 --> 00:01:12,985
No, who says I did?

27
00:01:13,059 --> 00:01:15,789
He's done nothing but lie to us.

28
00:01:15,962 --> 00:01:18,954
I don't believe he
intended for Riley to die.

29
00:01:19,165 --> 00:01:20,189
Yeah, but he was responsible.

30
00:01:20,266 --> 00:01:22,598
And he's going to have to live with that.
I'm not saying he was right.

31
00:01:22,669 --> 00:01:23,658
What are you saying?

32
00:01:23,737 --> 00:01:27,138
That I'm trying to understand
why he did what he did.

33
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:30,100
- Something wrong?
- On the contrary.

34
00:01:30,176 --> 00:01:32,474
So far, it seems like
everything you said is true.

35
00:01:32,545 --> 00:01:35,276
About the Ancients finding evidence
of a signal once being broadcast

36
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:36,680
across the universe.

37
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:39,411
It is amazing.

38
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,984
A distinct structure
in the background radiation.

39
00:01:42,056 --> 00:01:44,081
That sounds like static to me.

40
00:01:44,158 --> 00:01:46,092
<i>You were expecting
Stairway to Heaven?</i>

41
00:01:48,396 --> 00:01:49,556
This is huge.

42
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,292
It suggests more than a random order
to the universe.

43
00:01:52,366 --> 00:01:53,959
Possibly constructed by intelligent life.

44
00:01:54,036 --> 00:01:56,903
We're assuming you had no luck
deciphering any of it.

45
00:01:58,273 --> 00:02:00,605
Is this the reason you brought me up here?

46
00:02:00,675 --> 00:02:04,634
Well, you have planted false information
in the database before.

47
00:02:05,814 --> 00:02:08,681
- I'm just saying...
- Actually, I'm consulting.

48
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,412
Part of a new spirit of cooperation.

49
00:02:11,486 --> 00:02:14,388
As you may have noticed,
we dropped ourselves out of FTL.

50
00:02:15,024 --> 00:02:16,924
There are three planets in range.

51
00:02:16,993 --> 00:02:17,982
Conditions?

52
00:02:18,494 --> 00:02:20,462
One's a wasteland, but two show promise.

53
00:02:20,563 --> 00:02:21,894
Okay, I'll have a look.

54
00:02:22,065 --> 00:02:24,761
No, no, you go on. You go get some rest.

55
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:25,960
- No, no, I'm fine. I'm okay.
- No, seriously.

56
00:02:26,035 --> 00:02:28,435
I will tell you when there is
something worth writing home about.

57
00:02:28,538 --> 00:02:30,529
Sorry to have bothered you. Go ahead.

58
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,197
Okay.

59
00:02:34,678 --> 00:02:35,667
Thanks.

60
00:02:37,948 --> 00:02:39,040
- Hey, listen...
- Don't worry, Eli.

61
00:02:39,116 --> 00:02:41,141
Nothing's going to happen.
Nothing's going to happen.

62
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:43,082
We can start gathering some Kino data.

63
00:02:43,153 --> 00:02:45,280
Let me go to the Gate Room.
I'll put together some teams.

64
00:02:45,422 --> 00:02:46,411
Yeah.

65
00:02:50,394 --> 00:02:52,919
You don't have any idea
how much longer Homeworld Command

66
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,328
is going to want to talk to Ginn, do you?

67
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:59,069
I mean, it just seems like
they've been questioning her for...

68
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,502
I'm going to go to work.

69
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,670
Mandy?

70
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,141
Mandy, it's Nick.

71
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:38,637
This is Rush.
I need help, Ginn's quarters, now.

72
00:04:13,347 --> 00:04:14,336
Eli...

73
00:04:14,415 --> 00:04:15,576
<i>Colonel, this is Scott.</i>

74
00:04:15,651 --> 00:04:17,448
<i>All Lucian Alliance members
are accounted for</i>

75
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,316
<i>and locked down except Simeon.</i>

76
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:22,389
<i>Michaels was assigned to him,
and he is not responding on radio.</i>

77
00:04:46,549 --> 00:04:49,177
We don't know for sure.
It's never been confirmed

78
00:04:49,252 --> 00:04:50,981
- that that's what happened.
...until further notice.

79
00:04:51,054 --> 00:04:54,023
Teams of two, room by room.
I want him found.

80
00:05:12,476 --> 00:05:16,709
<i>Airman Dunning, come in.
This is Young. Please respond.</i>

81
00:05:17,882 --> 00:05:19,713
Sir, this is James.

82
00:05:19,784 --> 00:05:21,183
<i>Amanda Perry is dead.</i>

83
00:05:26,191 --> 00:05:28,159
Rush! Hey, Rush.

84
00:05:31,162 --> 00:05:32,527
<i>Sir, there's more.</i>

85
00:05:32,664 --> 00:05:35,394
Ginn told Homeworld Command
some things you'll want to hear.

86
00:05:44,543 --> 00:05:47,137
Colonel, give me a gun.

87
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,145
Wait here.

88
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:08,260
- Oh!
- Close and lock the doors. Now!

89
00:06:36,798 --> 00:06:37,891
Dial.

90
00:06:40,703 --> 00:06:41,897
Two men are down.

91
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,302
He's locked himself in the Gate Room
with at least one hostage.

92
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:49,537
Nobody's getting in here.
Just, please, let her go.

93
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:51,010
Don't move.

94
00:06:53,415 --> 00:06:54,541
Come here.

95
00:07:00,957 --> 00:07:03,892
Colonel, this is Greer.
I found Michaels. He's dead, sir.

96
00:07:09,966 --> 00:07:11,331
- Look, take me instead.
- No.

97
00:07:11,401 --> 00:07:12,732
Shut up! Both of you.

98
00:07:15,805 --> 00:07:16,965
Move.

99
00:07:17,574 --> 00:07:18,701
Wait...

100
00:07:20,544 --> 00:07:22,512
Mr. Brody, I need the door opened now!

101
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,604
I'm working on it.

102
00:07:31,355 --> 00:07:33,653
- Where'd he go?
- He went through.

103
00:07:37,661 --> 00:07:39,129
Wait. Wait!

104
00:07:53,044 --> 00:07:54,409
Where is he?

105
00:07:56,648 --> 00:07:59,277
He took Park. Rush went through after him.

106
00:07:59,385 --> 00:08:00,613
Re-dial.

107
00:08:15,034 --> 00:08:16,831
There's something on my back.

108
00:08:21,475 --> 00:08:23,534
He put something on my back.

109
00:08:50,472 --> 00:08:51,905
Let's move.

110
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,437
He's bleeding badly.

111
00:08:55,443 --> 00:08:58,344
I need help here. Get him on the table.

112
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:03,240
Bag him.

113
00:09:03,352 --> 00:09:04,512
I've got a chest wound over here!

114
00:09:04,587 --> 00:09:06,646
- Is the airway clear?
- Yes.

115
00:09:06,722 --> 00:09:09,885
Use the plastic to apply pressure.
You want to avoid air in the wound.

116
00:09:11,126 --> 00:09:12,491
Hold it steady!

117
00:09:12,561 --> 00:09:14,791
- He's bleeding pretty bad.
I can't get away.

118
00:09:14,864 --> 00:09:17,162
All right, let's get this clamped.

119
00:09:17,233 --> 00:09:18,291
He stopped breathing.

120
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:23,596
Do what you can.

121
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,368
I need a tube.

122
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:32,105
Talk to me.

123
00:09:32,182 --> 00:09:34,912
Simeon went through with Park hostage.
Rush went after him.

124
00:09:34,985 --> 00:09:36,213
Well, we need Simeon alive.

125
00:09:36,286 --> 00:09:38,151
- Sir?
- Ginn told Homeworld Command

126
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:39,951
that he knows the details
of the Alliance attack

127
00:09:40,024 --> 00:09:41,116
being planned against Earth.

128
00:09:41,192 --> 00:09:42,955
The location of the base, who's involved.

129
00:09:43,294 --> 00:09:44,761
He may be the only way to stop them.

130
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:46,763
Assuming he'll tell us.

131
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,197
It's a bomb, isn't it? One of theirs.

132
00:09:51,502 --> 00:09:52,491
Yes.

133
00:09:53,638 --> 00:09:55,230
We studied them, didn't we?

134
00:09:55,306 --> 00:09:57,001
Ginn, she told us how they work.

135
00:10:05,017 --> 00:10:08,214
This is Rush. Do not come through.
Repeat, do not come through.

136
00:10:08,754 --> 00:10:11,245
<i>I am attempting to disarm an explosive
at the base of the gate.</i>

137
00:10:11,323 --> 00:10:13,291
<i>- Do you copy?
- This is Young. Copy that.</i>

138
00:10:14,026 --> 00:10:15,288
Keep the gate open.

139
00:10:16,028 --> 00:10:17,222
<i>I'll let you
know when it's clear.</i>

140
00:10:33,413 --> 00:10:37,076
<i>Hold still. I'm going to try
and remove the cover.</i>

141
00:10:51,265 --> 00:10:53,062
Rush, this is Volker. Can you hear me?

142
00:10:53,534 --> 00:10:57,527
You can't disarm it,
but you can remove the proximity sensor.

143
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:00,170
Yeah. Please shut up.

144
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:06,744
There... There's a fuse.

145
00:11:07,115 --> 00:11:09,413
<i>I know. I just...</i>

146
00:11:10,452 --> 00:11:12,477
These pinholes are too small. I just...

147
00:11:13,521 --> 00:11:16,081
I don't have anything
that's going to do this.

148
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,619
I'm sorry, I... I can't.

149
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,525
Oh, God. Okay.

150
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,828
It's okay. It's okay.

151
00:11:25,568 --> 00:11:27,331
Get out of here. It's okay.

152
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,934
<i>It's okay.</i>

153
00:11:31,507 --> 00:11:33,134
Wait, wait, wait.

154
00:11:35,978 --> 00:11:36,967
Yeah.

155
00:12:06,844 --> 00:12:07,833
- You okay?
- Yeah.

156
00:12:07,912 --> 00:12:09,539
- You all right?
- Yeah.

157
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:13,039
Go.

158
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:24,518
Rush!

159
00:12:25,998 --> 00:12:27,522
I've got him.

160
00:12:34,873 --> 00:12:35,965
Rush!

161
00:13:35,403 --> 00:13:36,392
What happened?

162
00:13:36,471 --> 00:13:40,237
Simeon killed the man guarding him,
then he killed Ginn.

163
00:13:40,308 --> 00:13:41,332
Where is he?

164
00:13:41,409 --> 00:13:42,877
He took a hostage through the gate.

165
00:13:42,945 --> 00:13:43,969
Colonel, I swear, I had no idea...

166
00:13:44,046 --> 00:13:46,674
Before he got to her,
Ginn told Homeworld Command

167
00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:49,877
that Simeon had intelligence
about an attack

168
00:13:49,952 --> 00:13:52,011
that was being planned against Earth.

169
00:13:52,088 --> 00:13:53,783
Are you kidding me?

170
00:13:54,757 --> 00:13:56,520
Ginn and Simeon were from the same clan.

171
00:13:56,592 --> 00:13:58,355
Are you saying you know nothing
about this?

172
00:13:58,461 --> 00:14:00,895
You know the Lucian Alliance are made up
of different factions.

173
00:14:00,963 --> 00:14:02,829
There are many secrets between them.

174
00:14:02,966 --> 00:14:05,264
If I did know,
I would have told you before now.

175
00:14:05,335 --> 00:14:08,270
Is there anyone else on board
from that clan?

176
00:14:08,872 --> 00:14:10,066
No.

177
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:14,003
Colonel, about Simeon,
don't underestimate him.

178
00:14:14,211 --> 00:14:16,543
If I'm guilty of anything,
it's not warning you about him sooner.

179
00:14:16,613 --> 00:14:18,376
He's not going to get away.

180
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,382
- Let me help.
- I think you've done enough.

181
00:14:20,617 --> 00:14:22,744
I think it might be better
if you just let him go.

182
00:14:22,886 --> 00:14:25,151
He killed three people, injured four more.

183
00:14:25,223 --> 00:14:27,589
You'll lose more people trying
to bring him in alive.

184
00:14:28,293 --> 00:14:30,591
He's dangerous. Trust me.

185
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:53,951
Stay, stay, stay, stay!

186
00:14:55,688 --> 00:14:57,952
This is Scott. I'm okay.
Hold your positions.

187
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,153
- Are you hurt?
- No. No, no. I'm fine, I'm fine.

188
00:15:04,231 --> 00:15:06,290
Ah, wait. Wait, wait. Stop!

189
00:15:06,366 --> 00:15:09,164
What the hell? Rush, we need Simeon alive.

190
00:15:09,236 --> 00:15:11,602
He may have intel
on a Lucian Alliance attack on Earth.

191
00:15:11,671 --> 00:15:13,070
And you think he's going to tell you?

192
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:15,334
That's not my problem, right now.
I've got orders.

193
00:15:15,408 --> 00:15:16,432
I don't care.

194
00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:18,704
Listen, Rush, I get it, okay?

195
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:21,042
I can see how angry you are,
but you're going to get yourself killed.

196
00:15:21,114 --> 00:15:24,209
You have no idea where he could be hiding.
Just give me a second.

197
00:15:24,285 --> 00:15:26,583
<i>- Lieutenant James, do you read?
Yes, sir.</i>

198
00:15:26,654 --> 00:15:28,679
We will call our position due west
of the gate.

199
00:15:28,756 --> 00:15:31,748
<i>I want two men left behind to
guard the gate in case he circles back.</i>

200
00:15:31,826 --> 00:15:34,727
<i>The rest will split up
into two teams of three.</i>

201
00:15:34,862 --> 00:15:37,262
<i>One will head southwest,
the other northwest.</i>

202
00:15:37,331 --> 00:15:39,265
<i>Radio contact every 15 minutes.</i>

203
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:41,057
Roger that. James out.

204
00:15:41,969 --> 00:15:44,495
<i>Do we send you back to Destiny,
or are you here to help?</i>

205
00:15:46,842 --> 00:15:50,972
Listen. Listen! We have orders.

206
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,905
Right now, we need him alive.

207
00:15:54,216 --> 00:15:56,241
As far as I'm concerned,
as soon as the Colonel is done with him,

208
00:15:56,318 --> 00:15:58,843
you can do whatever the hell you want
to the son of a bitch. I don't care.

209
00:15:58,921 --> 00:16:00,252
If you don't kill him, I will.

210
00:16:00,322 --> 00:16:02,916
Right now, there could be lives at stake,

211
00:16:02,991 --> 00:16:04,823
people back on Earth.

212
00:16:05,161 --> 00:16:06,753
They may be a billion light years away,

213
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:08,319
but we still may be able
to do something about it.

214
00:16:08,398 --> 00:16:10,389
Are you hearing me?

215
00:16:12,568 --> 00:16:17,471
<i>Okay. We've got nine hours
till Destiny jumps back into FTL.</i>

216
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,035
If we have not found him
in four-and-a-half, we are turning back.

217
00:16:20,109 --> 00:16:21,474
Let's move.

218
00:16:44,201 --> 00:16:45,191
Hey.

219
00:16:47,672 --> 00:16:49,503
- You okay?
- Yeah.

220
00:16:51,609 --> 00:16:54,578
I still... I don't understand
why he let me live.

221
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:55,874
Well, he's a soldier.

222
00:16:55,947 --> 00:16:59,075
I mean, to him, this is a war
and you were unarmed.

223
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,811
What, you think he was being honorable?

224
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:03,251
That, or he knew
how much it would torture you.

225
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,928
Colonel Young wants us to stall the clock.
That's what I'm going to do.

226
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:13,727
Going to figure out how to stall the clock.

227
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:16,961
Hey. What can I do?

228
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,301
Hey. Are you okay?

229
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,307
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Look, I'm... I'm so sorry...

230
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:24,338
Yeah, I know. You did everything you could.

231
00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:29,745
- You sure you're all right?
- Yeah.

232
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:34,084
- Where are we at?
- We're trying to stall the clock.

233
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:40,590
Hey. T. J?

234
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:45,489
Dunning, Graham, and Lougheed
are all probably going to make it.

235
00:17:46,234 --> 00:17:47,963
Infection is always a risk.

236
00:17:48,069 --> 00:17:49,969
What about Henderson?

237
00:18:17,132 --> 00:18:20,067
This message you found
in the ship's database...

238
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,898
More of a signal, a repeating pattern.

239
00:18:24,106 --> 00:18:26,803
- You have any idea what it means?
- No.

240
00:18:26,876 --> 00:18:28,366
Obviously you think it's important.

241
00:18:31,314 --> 00:18:33,748
Yes. It's important.

242
00:18:34,717 --> 00:18:37,777
Its existence defies
the very laws of physics.

243
00:18:38,521 --> 00:18:41,081
Is it a message from God,
the almighty creator of the universe,

244
00:18:41,157 --> 00:18:43,125
as I'm sure you would like to believe?

245
00:18:43,726 --> 00:18:47,128
Well, I don't know.
We'll just have to wait and see, won't we?

246
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,027
Let's go.

247
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:57,034
I don't care if the Colonel forgives him.
I never will.

248
00:18:57,475 --> 00:19:01,775
Well, I'm not sure if anyone's
forgiven him, but maybe he's right,

249
00:19:02,213 --> 00:19:06,013
<i>that fulfilling Destiny's mission
is our best chance of getting home one day.</i>

250
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:09,349
All I'm saying is, from now on,
he'd better watch his own back.

251
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,389
We have no control over the clock yet.

252
00:19:20,465 --> 00:19:21,659
We're definitely not going to solve this

253
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:23,860
<i>before Destiny jumps back
into FTL this time.</i>

254
00:19:23,935 --> 00:19:25,163
This time.

255
00:19:25,237 --> 00:19:27,706
Well, we have to stay
in FTL a minimum of four hours,

256
00:19:27,773 --> 00:19:30,037
at which point we can drop back out again.

257
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:31,940
Good news is we'll still be in range.

258
00:19:32,812 --> 00:19:34,370
That'll be our last chance, though.

259
00:19:39,252 --> 00:19:40,480
<i>Not much time left.</i>

260
00:19:40,786 --> 00:19:42,720
They'll still be able to drop out in range.

261
00:19:43,389 --> 00:19:45,050
Check it out.

262
00:19:46,092 --> 00:19:47,390
What is it?

263
00:19:47,461 --> 00:19:49,190
Some kind of animal.

264
00:19:52,499 --> 00:19:54,797
Is it something we can barbecue?

265
00:21:58,131 --> 00:22:00,395
I can see why you would blame yourself.

266
00:22:01,901 --> 00:22:04,461
For what it's worth,
you didn't mean for this to happen.

267
00:22:08,374 --> 00:22:10,002
I brought her onboard.

268
00:22:14,848 --> 00:22:16,873
I understand why you kept the secret...

269
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:20,452
Why you felt you couldn't trust
Colonel Young.

270
00:22:26,927 --> 00:22:29,419
But we're going to
have to work these things out.

271
00:22:30,332 --> 00:22:33,392
All of us together, from now on,
learn to trust each other.

272
00:22:34,703 --> 00:22:36,500
What happened to following orders?

273
00:22:37,806 --> 00:22:40,400
Yeah, well, some things
are more complicated than that.

274
00:22:42,577 --> 00:22:43,908
Congratulations.

275
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:49,209
I'm saying we have to try
and figure out what's right.

276
00:22:53,756 --> 00:22:54,745
Not me.

277
00:22:56,158 --> 00:22:58,217
Revenge isn't going to bring her back.

278
00:22:58,694 --> 00:23:00,059
I know.

279
00:23:01,263 --> 00:23:04,164
You think it's going to make it
easier to live with?

280
00:23:11,007 --> 00:23:13,567
I don't even know
if we're going to find him anyway.

281
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:15,304
He could be hiding anywhere.

282
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:19,774
I guess the good news is he'll probably die
a miserable death out here.

283
00:23:20,884 --> 00:23:22,351
He's got a Kino remote.

284
00:23:24,921 --> 00:23:26,946
He'll probably wait for us to leave,
and then...

285
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:31,318
Try and use the gate to find his way back
to the Lucian Alliance we left behind.

286
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,224
Lieutenant.

287
00:23:39,303 --> 00:23:40,998
That looks like a track.

288
00:23:57,723 --> 00:23:58,712
You see him?

289
00:23:58,824 --> 00:23:59,984
I think he's up there.

290
00:24:07,733 --> 00:24:09,894
James, this is Scott. Do you read?

291
00:24:10,469 --> 00:24:11,528
<i>Go
ahead, Lieutenant.</i>

292
00:24:11,604 --> 00:24:13,231
Yeah, he's got us pinned down.

293
00:24:13,306 --> 00:24:14,398
<i>We heard the shots.</i>

294
00:24:14,474 --> 00:24:16,169
All right, good. That means you're close.

295
00:24:16,242 --> 00:24:18,233
We are at the bottom of a canyon,

296
00:24:18,311 --> 00:24:21,747
and he is dug in somewhere on a ridge
northwest of our position.

297
00:24:21,815 --> 00:24:25,080
<i>I see the canyon. We're topside.
Moving to flank him now.</i>

298
00:24:25,151 --> 00:24:27,210
<i>- E. T.A. is five minutes.
- Copy that.</i>

299
00:24:29,389 --> 00:24:32,848
<i>Eli? Eli, it's Chloe.
Can you hear me?</i>

300
00:24:35,663 --> 00:24:36,823
I can hear you.

301
00:24:37,531 --> 00:24:39,055
T.J. told me what happened.

302
00:24:40,267 --> 00:24:41,598
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

303
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:46,000
Look, I can't talk right now.
What are you doing?

304
00:24:47,675 --> 00:24:49,666
Are you in the navigation interface?

305
00:24:52,214 --> 00:24:54,307
- Yeah.
- I told you to stay out of that.

306
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,381
Sorry, I just...

307
00:24:56,451 --> 00:24:59,215
You know, this is complicated enough
without you messing up

308
00:24:59,287 --> 00:25:00,754
everything I'm trying to do.

309
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,579
<i>Eli?</i>

310
00:25:03,058 --> 00:25:05,026
Sorry. I don't have time right now. I'll...

311
00:25:05,927 --> 00:25:07,292
<i>Come and see you later.</i>

312
00:25:09,397 --> 00:25:12,424
- We need to drop out.
- So drop out!

313
00:25:14,337 --> 00:25:16,897
- Just warning you.
- Great.

314
00:25:29,552 --> 00:25:32,283
- Eight hours.
- Great.

315
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:37,759
<i>- Colonel Young, this is Brody.
- Go ahead.</i>

316
00:25:38,428 --> 00:25:40,362
We've got eight hours on the clock.

317
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,330
<i>I'll notify the team on the planet.</i>

318
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,396
One last time, to be clear, sir,
this will be our last window.

319
00:25:45,469 --> 00:25:46,959
<i>Understood. Young out.</i>

320
00:25:53,044 --> 00:25:54,136
Eli...

321
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,479
Just leave me alone.

322
00:25:59,651 --> 00:26:00,640
Okay?

323
00:26:13,165 --> 00:26:15,963
Lieutenant, we're approaching
his position. Stand by.

324
00:26:16,101 --> 00:26:17,261
Roger that.

325
00:26:29,448 --> 00:26:30,540
Rush get down!

326
00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:34,350
Tell them to get back.

327
00:26:37,724 --> 00:26:38,952
Tell them to get back!

328
00:26:40,093 --> 00:26:41,526
Get back. It is a trap!

329
00:26:43,897 --> 00:26:45,455
I repeat, it is a trap!

330
00:26:45,865 --> 00:26:47,093
Take cover!

331
00:27:01,949 --> 00:27:04,611
James! James! Come in!

332
00:27:22,804 --> 00:27:25,136
Sir, we got wounded up here.

333
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:27,197
How bad?

334
00:27:27,542 --> 00:27:30,807
Torres is unconscious.
Looks like Weber's arm is broken.

335
00:27:32,381 --> 00:27:33,576
Corporal Lee, do you read?

336
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:34,912
<i>Read you, Lieutenant.</i>

337
00:27:34,984 --> 00:27:36,576
<i>Moving to cover
Lieutenant James'position.</i>

338
00:27:37,053 --> 00:27:39,453
Assist with getting the wounded
back to the Stargate.

339
00:27:39,522 --> 00:27:40,614
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

340
00:27:42,291 --> 00:27:43,952
How did you know?

341
00:27:44,761 --> 00:27:45,955
I had a feeling.

342
00:27:46,729 --> 00:27:49,698
When I stood up and presented a target,
he didn't shoot.

343
00:27:49,766 --> 00:27:50,790
<i>What about you, sir?</i>

344
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,863
We can't leave you here without backup.

345
00:27:53,336 --> 00:27:54,599
Stand by.

346
00:27:54,838 --> 00:27:56,499
I saw you doing something
with that Kino remote.

347
00:27:56,573 --> 00:27:57,801
Yeah, I was checking the time.

348
00:27:57,875 --> 00:27:59,467
Damn it, Rush! Stop lying to me!

349
00:27:59,543 --> 00:28:01,135
Okay, I thought there might be a way

350
00:28:01,245 --> 00:28:03,213
for one remote to pinpoint
the location of another.

351
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,713
You knew he wasn't on that ridge anymore.

352
00:28:04,782 --> 00:28:06,409
Well, I've only figured it out now!

353
00:28:06,483 --> 00:28:08,781
Do you know his position?

354
00:28:10,054 --> 00:28:11,749
Yes, I think so.

355
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:19,022
James, we think we've found a way
of tracking Simeon using the Kino remote.

356
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:22,157
<i>Get the wounded safely back
to the gate and check back in.</i>

357
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,129
By my calculations, we've got a little less
than an hour before we've got to turn back.

358
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:27,837
<i>We are going after him.</i>

359
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,196
Roger that.

360
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:32,270
Let's move.

361
00:28:38,017 --> 00:28:39,746
Hey, Eli. What you doing?

362
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:43,487
Going to help on the planet,
and I don't care what you say.

363
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:47,790
I'm not going to be able to figure out
how to stall the clock in the time we have.

364
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,294
What exactly do you think
you're going to do on the planet?

365
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:52,387
I don't know. Something.

366
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:55,766
He's already injured two more Marines.
These are highly trained combat...

367
00:28:55,836 --> 00:29:00,034
Do you even know how complicated
Ancient programming algorithms are?

368
00:29:00,974 --> 00:29:04,034
'Cause Rush didn't solve it,
and he's had a couple of months.

369
00:29:05,212 --> 00:29:07,180
I need you to get back to the bridge.

370
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:11,741
Even if I could find a way
to quickly bypass all the protocols

371
00:29:11,818 --> 00:29:13,649
and add time to the clock,

372
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,589
I have no idea what the consequences
might be down the line.

373
00:29:18,025 --> 00:29:20,391
For all I know, we may end up
burning out all our power

374
00:29:20,461 --> 00:29:21,985
before we reach the next star.

375
00:29:22,497 --> 00:29:25,830
Are you ordering me to do that?

376
00:29:26,901 --> 00:29:31,531
I am considering the fact that we may
be able to save lives on Earth.

377
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,700
Only if we catch Simeon alive

378
00:29:34,777 --> 00:29:37,211
and if he just tells you
what you want to know.

379
00:29:37,846 --> 00:29:40,440
'Cause, really, what are
the chances of that?

380
00:29:40,883 --> 00:29:44,410
Now, are you going to let me
have one of these weapons or not?

381
00:29:44,486 --> 00:29:46,511
You're angry. Is that it, Eli?

382
00:29:46,989 --> 00:29:48,183
I get that.

383
00:29:48,624 --> 00:29:51,491
I also know that this is not
something that is in you,

384
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,187
and that's not something
that you should be ashamed of.

385
00:29:53,262 --> 00:29:54,388
Now, listen to me.

386
00:29:54,463 --> 00:29:56,864
Killing someone, no matter how much
you think they deserve it,

387
00:29:56,933 --> 00:29:59,231
is going to change you. All right?

388
00:29:59,302 --> 00:30:01,862
Don't you act like you are the only person
aboard this ship,

389
00:30:01,938 --> 00:30:04,566
that has lost someone
that they care about.

390
00:30:08,878 --> 00:30:10,470
- I know.
- Good.

391
00:30:11,314 --> 00:30:12,804
I need you to get back to the bridge.

392
00:30:39,311 --> 00:30:40,335
Here.

393
00:30:45,617 --> 00:30:46,845
Got him.

394
00:30:49,387 --> 00:30:50,376
Shoot him!

395
00:30:52,591 --> 00:30:53,956
What are you doing? Shoot him!

396
00:30:54,025 --> 00:30:55,549
- I did.
- Again!

397
00:30:58,197 --> 00:31:00,427
What the hell's the matter with you?
You had him in your sight!

398
00:31:00,499 --> 00:31:02,558
- Get off!
- What's the matter with you?

399
00:31:02,635 --> 00:31:04,500
Rush! He did the right thing!

400
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:07,471
What is the point of being able to
track him if we can't catch up to him!

401
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,973
He is wounded now!

402
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:11,305
Killing him could kill countless people
back on Earth.

403
00:31:11,377 --> 00:31:12,401
We are running out of time,

404
00:31:12,478 --> 00:31:15,879
and you're dreaming if you think he's ever
going to tell you what you want to know!

405
00:31:18,385 --> 00:31:20,478
Hey! Let me see, let me see.

406
00:31:20,888 --> 00:31:22,185
Buddy, you're going to be okay.

407
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:23,723
It doesn't look that bad.

408
00:31:27,861 --> 00:31:30,193
Rush? Rush!

409
00:31:34,067 --> 00:31:35,659
Ooh, I've got to get you back to the ship.

410
00:31:35,736 --> 00:31:37,932
Go! Go get him. I'm... I'm fine.

411
00:31:38,006 --> 00:31:39,837
No, you're not.
You are bleeding pretty bad.

412
00:31:39,908 --> 00:31:42,604
- I thought you said it didn't look bad.
- Ah, I lied.

413
00:31:44,045 --> 00:31:47,742
Rush, you've got to listen to me.
Greer has been hit.

414
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:49,712
<i>I've got to get him
back to the gate.</i>

415
00:31:49,918 --> 00:31:53,979
<i>You were right. We are out of time.
You have to turn back. Do you hear me?</i>

416
00:31:54,055 --> 00:31:55,317
<i>This is not worth it.</i>

417
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:59,026
We need you, Rush.

418
00:31:59,495 --> 00:32:01,520
<i>Don't throw everything
away for this.</i>

419
00:32:02,231 --> 00:32:03,357
Rush?

420
00:32:05,634 --> 00:32:06,623
<i>Rush?</i>

421
00:32:19,783 --> 00:32:21,216
She says she can help.

422
00:32:23,987 --> 00:32:26,512
Really? How?

423
00:32:27,223 --> 00:32:30,420
Well, you know Rush has been
giving me problems to solve.

424
00:32:31,061 --> 00:32:32,119
Equations.

425
00:32:33,663 --> 00:32:37,498
I... I didn't understand
any of it at first,

426
00:32:38,636 --> 00:32:41,696
but I would stare at it for hours,

427
00:32:41,772 --> 00:32:45,333
and then suddenly something
would pop into my head and...

428
00:32:45,409 --> 00:32:47,206
And I would write it down.

429
00:32:47,812 --> 00:32:52,112
Yeah, I know. Look, I get it.
You want to help.

430
00:32:52,183 --> 00:32:56,142
The point is, I think I'm starting
to understand it, Eli.

431
00:32:57,221 --> 00:33:00,851
It's like I'm slowly getting control
of whatever is in my head.

432
00:33:01,093 --> 00:33:02,424
Or it's getting control of you.

433
00:33:04,596 --> 00:33:07,087
You really want us to give her access
to the ship's systems?

434
00:33:07,165 --> 00:33:09,258
Eli, this is me talking.

435
00:33:10,435 --> 00:33:13,700
Please. I really think if I could just see
what the problems are.

436
00:33:14,306 --> 00:33:15,534
Can't hurt to let her look, can it?

437
00:33:15,607 --> 00:33:17,541
Actually, yes, it could.

438
00:33:18,611 --> 00:33:20,670
We're assuming that any solutions
she may provide us

439
00:33:20,747 --> 00:33:22,044
are what we really need.

440
00:33:22,115 --> 00:33:24,948
Yeah, and not some subroutine
that could sabotage the ship.

441
00:33:25,018 --> 00:33:27,316
The last thing we need right now
are those aliens attacking us again.

442
00:33:27,387 --> 00:33:30,618
And that's what I'm counting on
all of you for.

443
00:34:08,763 --> 00:34:09,821
Rush...

444
00:34:13,568 --> 00:34:17,504
I know you didn't care enough about Ginn
to risk your life coming after me.

445
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:23,578
I'm sure it was that other woman
she was connected to.

446
00:34:24,847 --> 00:34:27,543
<i>You must have
really cared for her.</i>

447
00:34:27,616 --> 00:34:29,140
<i>I understand revenge.</i>

448
00:34:30,386 --> 00:34:32,650
<i>Your people have killed
enough of mine.</i>

449
00:34:33,522 --> 00:34:34,887
People I cared about.

450
00:34:38,494 --> 00:34:40,190
I let you live. You know why?

451
00:34:41,832 --> 00:34:44,767
I wanted you to live
with it, the way I have.

452
00:34:45,001 --> 00:34:46,935
<i>I wanted the pain to eat you alive.</i>

453
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:50,632
<i>I know it's a fate worse than death.</i>

454
00:34:51,508 --> 00:34:54,204
I let you live, but next time I won't.

455
00:34:56,213 --> 00:35:00,344
You want your revenge?
You come and get it, Rush.

456
00:35:00,952 --> 00:35:03,045
I'm going to put you out of your misery.

457
00:35:04,322 --> 00:35:05,687
<i>Come and get me.</i>

458
00:35:21,607 --> 00:35:23,939
Hey, what are you doing? Chloe!

459
00:35:24,009 --> 00:35:25,101
Stop her!

460
00:35:27,579 --> 00:35:28,807
It's okay.

461
00:35:29,181 --> 00:35:31,308
What do you mean, "it's okay"?
What did you just do?

462
00:35:31,984 --> 00:35:33,815
I... I don't know, but it's okay.

463
00:35:35,888 --> 00:35:37,549
You said you were in control.

464
00:35:38,757 --> 00:35:40,350
Yeah, I am.

465
00:35:41,161 --> 00:35:43,095
Do you even know what you just did?

466
00:35:44,964 --> 00:35:45,988
No.

467
00:35:47,534 --> 00:35:50,697
- I'm sorry. I...
- You should go back to your quarters.

468
00:35:52,472 --> 00:35:53,962
Come on. Come on.

469
00:36:02,183 --> 00:36:04,515
Eli! You should look at this.

470
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:42,783
They stall the clock yet?

471
00:36:42,858 --> 00:36:45,884
<i>No, sir. Less than two hours now
until Destiny jumps again.</i>

472
00:36:45,962 --> 00:36:47,862
- And they say that's it.
- Dial the gate.

473
00:36:52,068 --> 00:36:54,002
What about Rush?

474
00:38:57,899 --> 00:38:59,696
I have information.

475
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,046
Oh, God.

476
00:40:23,423 --> 00:40:25,186
- You're late.
- I know.

477
00:40:26,059 --> 00:40:27,651
Nine hours late.

478
00:40:28,295 --> 00:40:31,162
- How's Greer?
- He's going to be okay.

479
00:40:31,765 --> 00:40:32,754
You?

480
00:40:35,569 --> 00:40:37,093
You didn't answer your radio.

481
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:41,231
The battery died a long time ago.
You didn't come after me.

482
00:40:42,075 --> 00:40:45,910
Eli figured out how to track
the Kino remotes the same way you did.

483
00:40:46,514 --> 00:40:49,108
We saw two signals heading back
this way together,

484
00:40:49,717 --> 00:40:52,550
figured one of you had them both
and the other was dead.

485
00:40:53,321 --> 00:40:54,310
True.

486
00:40:56,958 --> 00:40:58,858
You couldn't have known
you had so much extra time.

487
00:40:58,926 --> 00:41:00,723
What in the hell were you thinking?

488
00:41:01,963 --> 00:41:04,660
I knew Eli would figure out
how to stall the clock.

489
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:07,097
Really? Because he didn't.

490
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:09,294
What?

491
00:41:09,371 --> 00:41:12,465
Chloe calculated a new FTL course.

492
00:41:12,674 --> 00:41:15,234
She turned the ship around to come back
and get you.

493
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,906
Good for her.

494
00:41:20,549 --> 00:41:23,518
You gave her those equations
knowing she might be able to figure it out.

495
00:41:25,722 --> 00:41:26,780
I did.

496
00:41:29,659 --> 00:41:30,683
Dial the gate.

497
00:41:32,529 --> 00:41:36,090
Eli said there may still be
unforeseeable consequences as a result.

498
00:41:36,933 --> 00:41:38,992
Well, there always are, aren't there?

499
00:41:39,302 --> 00:41:42,635
I hope you were right about Simeon
not telling us about the attack on Earth.

500
00:41:47,211 --> 00:41:49,509
I'd hate to think we
could have prevented it.

501
00:41:54,184 --> 00:41:55,481
You feel any better?

502
00:43:29,118 --> 00:43:30,107
English - US - SDH
