00:02:39,942 --> 00:02:41,569
All right, get out of the way.
Get out of the way!
大丈夫、よけて。
よけて！

2
00:02:42,644 --> 00:02:43,736
Come here! Come here!

00:02:51,787 --> 00:02:55,450
This is Scott. Slow down the evac!
We are coming in too hot!

00:02:56,191 --> 00:02:57,488
Colonel, come in!
大佐、応答を！

00:02:57,626 --> 00:03:00,094

MAN 2: Oh, my God, where are we?
男  1 : もどって!
男  2 : オーマイガッ！どこ？

00:03:02,664 --> 00:03:04,097
WOMAN 1: What is this place?
女1 : ここはどこ？

8
00:03:05,134 --> 00:03:06,692
SCOTT: Move away from the gate!
スコット：ゲートから離れて！

9
00:03:09,805 --> 00:03:11,739
- Where are we?
- MAN 3: Where is this?
-どこ？
-男3: ここはどこ？

10
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,307
Why didn't we come through to Earth?
地球につながってたんじゃないの？

11
00:03:13,442 --> 00:03:15,637
There's no time to explain. Off to the side!
説明している時間はない。端へ！

12
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:16,904
WOMAN 2: What's going on?
女性2:どういうこと？

13
00:03:17,012 --> 00:03:19,310
SCOTT: All right.
Come on, come on, come on.
スコット:大丈夫
こっち、こっちへ。

14
00:03:22,117 --> 00:03:23,778
This is Scott. Come in!

Colonel, come in!
大佐、応答を！

16
00:03:28,524 --> 00:03:31,049
- I need a medic!
- Over here!
-医療班！
-こっちよ！

00:03:33,462 --> 00:03:36,795
JOHANSEN: Can you move your fingers?
VOLKER: No. I think my arm's broken.
ヨハンセン:指を動かせる？
ヴォルカー:いや、折れてると思う。

18
00:03:36,932 --> 00:03:39,992
Okay, just hold your arm there
and we'll put it in a sling, okay?
じゃあ、固定するわ、OK？

19
00:04:04,026 --> 00:04:07,257
Keep calm. Keep coming.
落ち着いて、続いて。

20
00:04:21,343 --> 00:04:23,971
Clear this area.
There could still be more incoming.
ここは安全だ。
たぶん、まだくるぞ。

21
00:04:48,103 --> 00:04:50,003
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
-大丈夫ですか？
-あぁ。

22
00:04:52,374 --> 00:04:54,137
We've got to move. Move!
-移動して、移動！

23
00:04:55,711 --> 00:04:57,235
Where the hell are we?
どこなんだ？

24
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:05,383
- Greer? Where's Colonel Young?
- He was right behind me.
- グリアー？大佐はどこだ？
- 自分の真後ろにいました。

25
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,459
- Move. Move. Move.
- SCOTT: Quiet!
- 移動して、移動。
- スコット：静かに！

26
00:05:22,337 --> 00:05:24,134
- GREER: Stay calm!
- Move. Excuse me.
- グリアー：冷静に！
- ちょっと、失礼！！

27
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:25,536
GREER: Keep it down!
グリアー：静かに！

28
00:05:25,674 --> 00:05:27,471
Move. Move. Move. Move. Move.
ちょっと、移動する。通して。

29
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:33,980
Colonel? Colonel?
大佐？大佐？

30
00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:35,373
Don't move.
動かすな。

31
00:05:36,552 --> 00:05:38,019
Where are... Where are we?
われわれ…、われわれはどこに？

32
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,350
I don't know, sir. Are you...
大佐、わかりません…

33
00:05:42,124 --> 00:05:44,558
You're in charge, okay?
君が指揮をとれ、いいか？

34
00:05:44,693 --> 00:05:46,524
You're...
あなたは…

35
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,662
Sir?
大佐？

36
00:05:56,638 --> 00:05:58,765
- T.J.!
- JOHANSEN: I'm coming!
- T.J.！
- ヨハンセン：いきます！

37
00:05:58,907 --> 00:06:00,499
GREER: Move back, people!
Coming through!
グリアー：下がって！
通るよ！

38
00:06:00,609 --> 00:06:03,840
JOHANSEN: Let's go! Move, move, move!
GREER: Get back, people.
ヨハンセン：いこう！
グリアー：みな、下がれ！

39
00:06:06,715 --> 00:06:09,616
- Is he okay?
- I don't know.
彼は大丈夫か？
わからないわ。

40
00:06:09,751 --> 00:06:11,184
WRAY: Get back!
レイ：下がれ！

41
00:06:14,222 --> 00:06:17,623
Wallace! What is this place?
ウォレス！ここはどこだ？

42
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,852
- Look, I just did what Rush told me...
- Where is he?
- ちょうどラッシュに同じことを聞こうと…
- 彼はどこだ？

43
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,088
I don't know. He went through ahead of me.
わからない。僕の前にゲートを抜けたけど。

44
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:25,461
Rush! Rush! Eli, help me find him.
ラッシュ！ラッシュ！イーライ、探すのを手伝ってくれ。

45
00:06:25,601 --> 00:06:26,693
What, I...
あぁ。

46
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,696
MAN 5: What's that?
男５：なんだ？

47
00:06:34,743 --> 00:06:37,803
What in the hell was that?
なんだ？

48
00:06:37,946 --> 00:06:40,244
I don't know. Look,
わからない。

49
00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:43,318
Sergeant, I need you
to get these people settled.
軍曹、みなを落ち着かせるのにきみの助けが必要だ。

50
00:06:43,452 --> 00:06:48,389
And you find out who and what we've got.
Nobody leaves this room.
それから、装備と人員を確認しろ。
だれも部屋から出すな。

51
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,650
Yes, sir.
イエス、サー。

52
00:06:54,763 --> 00:06:56,287
Eli! Now!
イーライ！

53
00:07:04,373 --> 00:07:06,136
ELI: The core of the planet
is the power source.
イーライ：動力源は星のコアだ。

54
00:07:06,274 --> 00:07:08,469
You have to channel it into the weapon
to destroy the enemy ship.
敵を撃破するため、兵器にパワーを与える必要がある。

55
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,271
- MAN: Can't do it, dude.
- Uh, doing it.
- 男：できないよ。
- いや、やるんだ。

56
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:12,745
It's one of those programmer's jokes,
a problem that can't be solved.
イースターエッグのひとつさ、
解けないよ。

57
00:07:12,848 --> 00:07:14,645
- Already solved it.
- No, you didn't.
- 既に解いた。
- いや、解けてない。

58
00:07:14,783 --> 00:07:18,446
Just shut up! Watch this.
だまれ！みてろ。

59
00:07:24,893 --> 00:07:26,485
- What the hell!
- What happened?
- いったいどうなってる！
- なにが起こった？

60
00:07:26,628 --> 00:07:30,689
Nothing happened.
I'm back at the beginning of the level.
何も。
最初のレベルに戻った。

61
00:07:30,832 --> 00:07:32,823
- You're so full of yourself.
- No. No, no, no. It worked.
- うぬぼれすぎ。
- いや、いやいや、やったのに。

62
00:07:32,968 --> 00:07:35,266
- The firing code locked in.
- Whatever.
発射コードはロックされたんだ。
なんとでもいえるさ。

63
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:41,466
That was extremely unsatisfying.
納得いかないな。

64
00:07:55,724 --> 00:07:57,021
Eli Wallace?
イーライ ウォレス？

65
00:07:58,627 --> 00:08:01,755
Actually, Eli's not here right now.
実は、イーライは今ここにはいない。

66
00:08:04,132 --> 00:08:08,000
Okay, okay. Whatever you guys think
that I did, I swear you got the wrong guy.
OK。OK。僕がそうだと思ってるんだろ。違うと誓うよ。

67
00:08:08,136 --> 00:08:10,263
Do I look like someone
who'd be standing here
ここに突っ立てる私がどう見える？

68
00:08:10,372 --> 00:08:13,500
if I didn't already know
everything there is to know about you?
君についてのすべてをしらないとでも？

69
00:08:14,176 --> 00:08:15,939
- Yeah, not really.
- Right.
わかった。ちがうよ。
よし。

70
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,512
ELI: Who are you?
イーライ：だれ？

71
00:08:18,647 --> 00:08:21,673
Dr. Nicholas Rush. May we come in?
ニコラス ラッシュ博士だ。入っても？

72
00:08:22,384 --> 00:08:23,476
Why?
なんで？

73
00:08:26,021 --> 00:08:28,012
You just spent a great deal of time recently
かなり時間かかるからさ。

74
00:08:28,156 --> 00:08:30,488
playing an online fantasy game
called Prometheus.
プロメテウスというオンライン
ファンタジーゲームをやってるね？

75
00:08:32,327 --> 00:08:34,454
Big Brother's got nothing better to do?
やってるけどなにか問題でも？

76
00:08:35,731 --> 00:08:38,632
Last night you solved
the Dakara weapons puzzle.
昨夜、君はダカラ兵器のパズルを解いたね。

77
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,969
Yeah, a month of my life went into that.
あぁ、人生の一ヶ月をかけた

78
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:45,562
You know what happens
when you solve that thing? Nothing.
なにがおこったか知ってるかい？なにもさ。

79
00:08:45,707 --> 00:08:49,143
We're here. That happened.
われわれがここにいる。おこったじゃないか。

80
00:08:49,244 --> 00:08:51,178
To complete that particular puzzle,
君は、あの特殊なパズルを

81
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,373
you had to solve
a millennia-old mathematical proof,
完成させるためにエイリアンの言語で書かれた

82
00:08:54,516 --> 00:08:56,211
written in another language.
一万年前の数学的証明を解いたんだ。

83
00:08:56,351 --> 00:08:59,377
For that, you've won something of a prize.
それで、君はちょっとした賞を獲得した。

84
00:08:59,521 --> 00:09:02,922
Well, whatever it is,
I'll take the cash equivalent.
そう、賞金か何かならうけとるけど。

85
00:09:03,058 --> 00:09:04,491
There isn't one.
賞金ではない。

86
00:09:04,593 --> 00:09:07,084
It's a non-disclosure agreement.
機密保持契約書だ。

87
00:09:07,229 --> 00:09:08,560
Non-disclosure?
機密保持だって？

88
00:09:08,697 --> 00:09:12,724
So, you guys really embedded
a top-secret problem into a game,
それで、あんたたちは、誰かが解くことを期待して

89
00:09:12,868 --> 00:09:16,235
hoping someone like me would solve it?
最高機密をゲームに埋め込んだの？

90
00:09:16,571 --> 00:09:18,038
Yup.
あぁ。

91
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,869
So, what do you need me for now?
それで、俺が必要？

92
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:24,000
I assure you,
it'll be worth your while to sign it.
保証するよ。
サインして間違いはない。

93
00:09:25,113 --> 00:09:26,239
And if I don't?
それで、サインしなかったら？

94
00:09:26,381 --> 00:09:28,713
We'll beam you up to our spaceship.
宇宙船に君を転送する。

95
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:39,093
Right. I think I want my lawyer
to look it over first.
わかった、まず俺の弁護士に
確認してもらうよ。

96
00:09:39,227 --> 00:09:42,424
And by "lawyer,"
I assume you mean "mother."
弁護士でなく、母親だろう。


97
00:09:42,964 --> 00:09:45,797
So, we'll just agree then
that I will call you.
それじゃ、サインするときは電話するよ。

98
00:10:07,489 --> 00:10:08,751
What the...
なんだ…

99
00:10:14,229 --> 00:10:17,027
Welcome aboard the Hammond, Eli.
ハモンドへようこそ。

100
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:21,524
Yes, that is planet Earth,
and yes, you are on a spaceship.
あぁ、あれは地球だよ。
宇宙船内にいるんだ。

101
00:10:22,571 --> 00:10:23,902
We need your help, Eli.
君の助けが必要だ、イーライ。

102
00:10:24,005 --> 00:10:27,202
To be honest,
I don't know how long it's going to take.
正直にいって、どのくらい時間がかかるかわからないんだ。

103
00:10:27,309 --> 00:10:30,767
I should call my mom
to tell her where I am.
ママにどこにいるのか電話しなきゃ。

104
00:10:30,912 --> 00:10:33,403
That's probably not going to work up here.
たぶん、ここでは使えない。

105
00:10:34,182 --> 00:10:35,706
Right.
そうか。

106
00:10:35,817 --> 00:10:37,284
You can speak to her on the way.
途中で電話できるよ。

107
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,386
There's a cover story you'll have to follow.
カバーストーリを用意してる。

108
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,650
I'm sorry. On the way to?
ちょっと待って、途中でって？

109
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:45,726
To another planet,
21 light years from here.
別の惑星へ行く。
21光年先だ。

110
00:10:46,595 --> 00:10:49,758
I can't go.
I have things that...
いけないよ。
いろいろあるし…

111
00:10:49,865 --> 00:10:51,924
We know about your mother's condition.
君のお母さんの状態は知ってる。

112
00:10:53,301 --> 00:10:54,928
You just know everything, don't you?
すべてを知ってるの？

113
00:10:55,203 --> 00:10:57,637
We also know that
you are currently unemployed,
今無職だということも、

114
00:10:58,206 --> 00:11:00,504
and that your mother's
medical coverage is
君の母親に健康上の問題が

115
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,243
an ongoing issue.
あるということもね。

116
00:11:04,512 --> 00:11:06,571
We'll see she gets the best available care
while you're gone.
われわれなら君の母親に過去最高のケアができるよ。

117
00:11:06,681 --> 00:11:10,344
And if I don't sign, what?
You going to erase my memory?
それで、もしサインしなかったら何？
記憶を消すのかい？

118
00:11:12,854 --> 00:11:14,515
Something like that.
それもありえる。

119
00:11:18,493 --> 00:11:21,462
Can I get some pants?
替えのパンツある？

120
00:11:31,473 --> 00:11:36,172
Hello, I'm Dr. Daniel Jackson,
and behind me is a stargate.
やぁ、僕はダニエル・ジャクソン博士。
そして後ろにあるのがスターゲイトだ。

121
00:11:36,311 --> 00:11:40,975
It was originally built millennia ago by
an alien race who we call the Ancients.
元は、エンシェントと呼ばれる1万年前の種族によって作られた。

122
00:11:41,082 --> 00:11:43,346
Over the next few hours,
we'll be touching on some of the things...
数時間かけて、いろいろなものについて説明する。

123
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:47,615
There are 39 symbols representing
star constellations as seen from Earth...
これらは地球から見える星座を表した39のシンボルだ。

124
00:11:47,722 --> 00:11:49,519
When a connection is made
between two stargates,
スターゲイト間がつながったとき

125
00:11:49,658 --> 00:11:52,821
an unstable energy vortex
emerges from the gate...
不安定なエネルギーの渦がゲイトから出てくる。

126
00:11:53,528 --> 00:11:54,517
Whoa!
わお。

127
00:11:54,663 --> 00:11:58,121
...and settles into the event horizon,
or "puddle, " as we like to call it.
そしてイベントホライズンに落ち着く。

128
00:11:58,433 --> 00:12:01,027
Later, it was discovered
that using an eighth symbol
後に、数十万光年先の別の銀河にダイアルできる

129
00:12:01,169 --> 00:12:04,400
would actually dial another galaxy
in hundreds of thousands of light years
8番目のシンボルを発見した。

130
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:06,166
via an interstellar wormhole.
銀河間のワームホールをとおして

131
00:12:06,274 --> 00:12:08,504
It is believed an unprecedented amount
of power is required
9番目のシンボルに到達するには前例にない


132
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:09,811
to reach the near-mythical ninth chevron.
The first six symbols...
ほどのパワーが必要だと考えている。
最初の6つのシンボルだが、

133
00:12:09,846 --> 00:12:11,745
to reach the near-mythical ninth chevron.
The first six symbols...
ほどのパワーが必要だと考えている。
最初の6つのシンボルだが、

134
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,542
Icarus Base was established
on a planet discovered two years ago
2年前に発見したイカルス基地には

135
00:12:14,683 --> 00:12:16,674
to have a uniquely powerful core.
ほかにはない強力なコアがある。

136
00:12:16,785 --> 00:12:19,345
The entire purpose of the project
is to hopefully one day
プロジェクトの目的は

137
00:12:19,454 --> 00:12:23,515
dial the nine chevron address
found in the Ancient database.
エンシェントのデータベースから見つかった
9つのアドレスをダイアルすることだ。

138
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,559
Hi! I'm Dr. Daniel Jackson.
やぁ、僕はダニエル・ジャクソン博士。

139
00:12:25,694 --> 00:12:28,060
Now, you've heard the term
"hyperspace " for years...
いま、君が聞いたハイパースペースとは

140
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,089
- Where are you?
- ELI: It's top secret.
- どこにいるの？
- イーライ:機密なんだ。

141
00:12:31,232 --> 00:12:32,893
- Eli!
- I'm serious, Ma.
- イーライ！
- ほんとだよ、ママ。

142
00:12:33,034 --> 00:12:34,331
I can't say anything more than that.
言えないんだ。

143
00:12:34,436 --> 00:12:37,234
But I don't understand. Why could you not
at least tell me you were leaving?
けどわからないわ。どうして、何もいわずに
家をでたの？

144
00:12:37,706 --> 00:12:40,038
I'm sorry, but did you get the letter from...
ごめんよ、けど、手紙が届いたろ…

145
00:12:40,141 --> 00:12:42,075
Yeah, the Air Force. I got it.
あぁ、空軍からのね。

146
00:12:43,211 --> 00:12:45,941
Are you in a plane now?
You sound like you're in an airplane.
飛行機に乗ってるの？
飛行機に乗ってるような音がするわ。

147
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:48,743
Uh, no. It's nothing like that.
うん。いや、まぁそんなとこ。

148
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,143
I want you to know that
they're going to look after you.
後の面倒は彼らが見てくれるから。

149
00:12:51,486 --> 00:12:53,078
Well, you didn't have to do this.
そぅ、わかったわ。

150
00:12:53,588 --> 00:12:55,112
This is good.
よかった。

151
00:12:56,424 --> 00:12:59,291
Really. It's the kind of thing
I always dreamed of.
本当に、常に夢見てきたようなことなんだ。

152
00:13:09,337 --> 00:13:11,396
- Hi.
- You mind?
やぁ。
ここいい？

153
00:13:11,806 --> 00:13:14,206
- No, go ahead.
- Thank you.
えぇ、どうぞ。
サンキュー。

154
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,271
First time on a spaceship, too?
あなたも宇宙船は初めて？

155
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:27,218
Me? I've been on lots of various...
俺？いや、何度目かな。

156
00:13:28,623 --> 00:13:30,147
- Eli Wallace.
- I know.
- イーライ・ウォレスだ。
- 知ってるわ。

157
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:33,659
- You've heard of me?
- I have.
- 聞いたことあるの？
- ええ。

158
00:13:33,962 --> 00:13:35,953
Wow, that almost never happens.
わお。まじか。

159
00:13:36,598 --> 00:13:37,656
And you are?
それで君は？

160
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:40,393
Chloe. I work for Alan Armstrong.
クロエ。アラン・アームストロングの秘書よ。

161
00:13:42,137 --> 00:13:43,502
Senator of California?
カリフォルニアの上院議員？

162
00:13:43,638 --> 00:13:46,630
Oh, yeah, yeah. I have heard of California.
あぁそう。カリフォルニアってのは聞いたことある。

163
00:13:47,942 --> 00:13:51,434
My last job was in the burger and fries
field. How'd you line that up?
僕の最後の仕事はバーガーショップでの揚げ物。
きみは？

164
00:13:51,546 --> 00:13:54,515
I was a political science major
at Harvard, so...
わたしはハーバードで政治学を専攻してたわ。

165
00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:58,585
Mmm. I hear it's a good school.
For a while there I was at...
へぇ。いい学校だね。
少しの間、僕は…

166
00:13:58,686 --> 00:14:00,449
MIT. I know.
MITにいた。

167
00:14:00,555 --> 00:14:03,683
Really? What else have
they told you about me?
本当？他に僕についてなにを聞いたの？

168
00:14:17,238 --> 00:14:19,763
- What?
- I've seen this writing before.
- なんだ？
- この文字前にみたよ。

169
00:14:20,909 --> 00:14:22,706
- In the game?
- Yeah.
- ゲームで？
- そう。

170
00:14:33,354 --> 00:14:36,846
Sheesh. We're on a ship?
わお。僕らは船に？

171
00:14:39,994 --> 00:14:44,556
RUSH: The design is clearly Ancient,
in the truest sense of the word.
ラッシュ：これは明らかにエンシェントのデザインだ。

172
00:14:45,366 --> 00:14:48,358
Launched hundreds of thousands
of years ago.
数十万年前のね。

173
00:14:48,503 --> 00:14:50,164
Dr. Rush?
ラッシュ博士？

174
00:14:50,271 --> 00:14:53,399
Faster than light,
yet not through hyperspace.
ハイパースペースの前の超光速航行だ。

175
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,476
- What are you doing?
- Who knows how far it's traveled.
- なにしてる？
- だれがどのくらい旅したかがわかるか。

176
00:14:56,578 --> 00:15:00,674
Dr. Rush, I've got a lot of wounded.
We need to get home.
- ラッシュ博士、大勢の負傷者がいる。
- われわれは家に帰りたいんだ。

177
00:15:17,232 --> 00:15:18,722
JOHANSEN ON RADIO:
Lieutenant Scott, come in.
ヨハンセン(無線)：
スコット中尉、応答を。

178
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,525
Go ahead.
どうぞ！

179
00:15:20,869 --> 00:15:23,531
We've got a problem.
One of the air vents just shut down in here.
問題があります。
ここのひとつの通気坑がいまこわれました。

180
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,030
Copy that.
了解。

181
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:29,667
Yeah, the air's getting pretty thin
in here, too.
あぁ、ここも空気が薄くなってきている。

182
00:15:29,777 --> 00:15:33,269
- What does that mean?
- That the life support system is failing.
- どういう意味だ？
- 生命維持システムが機能していないんだ。

183
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:37,379
And we should probably do
something about that.
どうにかしなければならない。

184
00:15:47,662 --> 00:15:49,254
EMILY: Well, it's always just one more year.
エミリー：それで、一年間ずっとそれよ。

185
00:15:49,397 --> 00:15:50,762
It's a command.
命令なんだ。

186
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:53,561
- Where?
- It's a lot safer than other places I've been.
- どこ？
- 前いたとこよりは安全なところさ。

187
00:15:53,668 --> 00:15:56,967
- You've put your time in, Everett.
- When this tour is over, I promise...
- 時間がかかったわ、エヴァレット。
- この任務が終わったときには、約束する。

188
00:15:57,105 --> 00:16:00,438
You know what?
Never mind. Don't bother.
例のあれ？
心配するないで。邪魔しないで。

189
00:16:00,575 --> 00:16:03,806
You always end up choosing
somewhere other than here.
あなたは結局ここ以外のどこかで選択するのよ。

190
00:16:03,945 --> 00:16:06,379
I am not choosing
my job over you.
俺は、きみより仕事を優先してないよ。

191
00:16:06,481 --> 00:16:09,211
How you can even say...
How you can even say that to me?
それをいうのか…
おれに？

192
00:16:10,451 --> 00:16:13,614
I love you, but I can't wait anymore.
I can't wait anymore.
愛している。けどもう待てない。
もう待てないわ。

193
00:16:19,093 --> 00:16:24,395
Everett? Are you okay?
Sweetheart, baby, look at me.
エヴァレット？大丈夫？
あなた、私をみて。

194
00:16:28,503 --> 00:16:33,133
Colonel? Colonel?
大佐？大佐？

195
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:39,437
Oh, my God.
オーマイガッ

196
00:16:43,051 --> 00:16:44,313
Can't you do something?
なにかできることはない？

197
00:16:44,452 --> 00:16:46,682
He's having a seizure.
There's nothing I can do.
発作よ。
できることはないわ。

198
00:17:01,202 --> 00:17:03,830
ON RADIO: Scott, this is Colonel Young.
Come in, please.
無線：スコット、こちらヤング大佐
応答を、どうぞ。

199
00:17:04,739 --> 00:17:07,765
Our guests have arrived a few minutes
early, Lieutenant. What's your position?
来客がすこし早く到着した。
どこにいる？

200
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,844
Come on. Not yet. Not yet.
おい、まだか。

201
00:17:12,747 --> 00:17:16,342
Lieutenant, drop whatever you're doing
and get your ass up here.
中尉、いまやってることがなんであれこっちへこい！

202
00:17:20,888 --> 00:17:22,185
I'm on my way, sir.
向かってます。大佐。

203
00:17:30,231 --> 00:17:31,459
Bye.
じゃあな。

204
00:17:44,012 --> 00:17:45,479
Holy...
まったく…

205
00:17:50,084 --> 00:17:53,178
Senator, it is my honor
to welcome you to Icarus Base.
イカルス基地へお越しいただき光栄です。

206
00:17:53,288 --> 00:17:56,348
Colonel. This is
my executive assistant, Chloe.
大佐、秘書のクロエだ。

207
00:17:56,591 --> 00:17:57,523
- It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
- The pleasure's mine.
お会いできて光栄ですわ、大佐。
私もです。

208
00:17:59,243 --> 00:18:00,904
She's also my daughter.
彼女は私の娘でもある。

209
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:07,916
- You must be the...
- Contest winner, yeah. That is a big gun.
- あなたはたしか…
- コンテストの勝者さ。でかい銃だね。

210
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:09,509
Rail gun. 500 rounds per minute.
レールガンだ。一分間に５００発発射できる。

211
00:18:11,022 --> 00:18:14,219
This is Lieutenant Scott.
He's been assigned to you, Mr. Wallace.
こちらは、スコット中尉。
ウォレス氏の担当だ。

212
00:18:14,325 --> 00:18:15,815
Shall we go inside?
さぁ中へ。

213
00:18:21,365 --> 00:18:24,732
ELI: Unbelievable.
SCOTT: Yeah, it is.
イーライ：信じられない。
スコット：あぁそうだろ。

214
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:28,969
It's weird how fast you can start
to take something like this for granted.
君がどれだけはやくことに取り掛かれるか怪しいな。

215
00:18:30,675 --> 00:18:34,611
So, if a stargate can instantly
transport you to another planet,
それで、スターゲイトで接続できるのに

216
00:18:34,712 --> 00:18:36,543
why did we fly here on a spaceship?
なぜここまで宇宙船で？

217
00:18:36,647 --> 00:18:40,344
Something to do with how this one's
tied into the planet for power.
なにか惑星に作用するパワーがあるらしい。

218
00:18:40,484 --> 00:18:43,510
Apparently, it's been modified
to only dial out


219
00:18:43,654 --> 00:18:45,884
because incoming wormholes
are too dangerous.
なぜならワームホールは危険すぎるからだ。

220
00:18:46,724 --> 00:18:49,488
You're the genius.
You can probably tell me better.

221
00:18:49,627 --> 00:18:52,357
All I did was solve a puzzle
in a video game.

222
00:18:52,463 --> 00:18:56,365
Hey, you figured out something Dr. Rush
has been trying to figure out for months,

223
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,459
which, by the way,
a lot of people were glad to see.

224
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:04,171
RUSH: And, of course,
you know Colonel Telford.

225
00:19:04,308 --> 00:19:06,503
- Ready for this, Colonel?
- You just give the word, sir.

226
00:19:06,644 --> 00:19:08,544
Oh, I gave it quite a while ago, Colonel.

227
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:11,807
I'm just here to see
how my $1.6 billion is being spent.

228
00:19:13,551 --> 00:19:15,781
Very good. Thank you, everyone.

229
00:19:17,254 --> 00:19:18,278
Dismissed.

230
00:19:23,276 --> 00:19:25,301
As you know, up until now,

231
00:19:25,445 --> 00:19:28,778
we have been unable to channel
the precise amount of power necessary

232
00:19:28,882 --> 00:19:31,646
to unlock the stargate's
ninth and final chevron.

233
00:19:31,785 --> 00:19:35,152
However, thanks to some ingenuity
from young Mr. Wallace here,

234
00:19:35,955 --> 00:19:37,320
that problem has finally been solved.

235
00:19:37,457 --> 00:19:39,652
YOUNG: We've heard that before.

236
00:19:39,793 --> 00:19:40,987
This time we're sure.

237
00:19:41,861 --> 00:19:43,829
That's what I figured out?

238
00:19:43,963 --> 00:19:47,296
I embedded the mathematical problem
we had to solve into the game.

239
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,359
I then engineered your solution
into a practical, workable application.

240
00:19:53,073 --> 00:19:56,668
- What say we get on with it?
- Absolutely. Sergeant Riley.

241
00:19:59,412 --> 00:20:01,437
- RILEY: Chevron one encoded.
- Sir.

242
00:20:08,722 --> 00:20:10,053
We're dialing now?

243
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,681
- A test, to see if we can make a connection.
- RILEY: Chevron one locked.

244
00:20:12,826 --> 00:20:15,488
If we do, we will send an automated
reconnaissance drone through.

245
00:20:15,595 --> 00:20:17,028
We'll see what's on the other side.

246
00:20:17,163 --> 00:20:18,460
RILEY: Chevron two locked.

247
00:20:18,565 --> 00:20:19,725
And then they'll go?

248
00:20:19,866 --> 00:20:22,664
No, first, we close down again,
assess the data we receive,

249
00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:25,465
- and then perhaps send the away team.
- If it works.

250
00:20:26,873 --> 00:20:27,897
RILEY: Chevron four locked.

251
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:31,977
Until then,
they're just interested observers, like us.

252
00:20:32,078 --> 00:20:33,636
RILEY: Chevron five locked.

253
00:20:33,747 --> 00:20:38,207
Chevron six encoded. Chevron six locked.

254
00:20:40,186 --> 00:20:43,917
Chevron seven encoded.
Chevron seven locked.

255
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:49,819
Chevron eight encoded.
Chevron eight locked.

256
00:20:50,697 --> 00:20:52,665
Chevron nine encoded.

257
00:20:59,439 --> 00:21:02,840
- Whoa, what's going on?
- I don't know. We never got this far before.

258
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:09,879
Chevron nine... Chevron nine will not lock.

259
00:21:16,623 --> 00:21:21,219
We matched the power requirements
down to the EMU. It must work.

260
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:23,557
Power levels in the gate capacitors
are going into the red.

261
00:21:23,663 --> 00:21:25,426
- Shut it down.
- No, wait, wait, wait.

262
00:21:25,532 --> 00:21:27,523
RILEY: We're reading fluctuations
in the output from the core...

263
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:29,101
Shut it down now.

264
00:21:45,819 --> 00:21:47,753
- It should have worked.
- Well, it didn't.

265
00:21:47,854 --> 00:21:49,549
And drawing power
from the planet's core...

266
00:21:49,656 --> 00:21:50,884
Dangerous? Yes. We're all aware of that...

267
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,821
Regardless of what's been spent
or what's at stake,

268
00:21:52,926 --> 00:21:56,794
my first priority is to ensure
the safety of the people on this base.

269
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,400
Of course. Of course.

270
00:22:04,671 --> 00:22:08,437
Eli, we'd best run through
your equations again.

271
00:22:09,275 --> 00:22:10,572
If you'll excuse me.

272
00:22:11,511 --> 00:22:14,446
You are not seriously putting this on me!

273
00:22:19,686 --> 00:22:21,176
Not my fault.

274
00:22:29,829 --> 00:22:33,629
SCOTT: People, you have to calm down.
Seriously, you have to calm down.

275
00:22:36,703 --> 00:22:38,898
MAN: We got power!
WOMAN: Thank God!

276
00:22:39,272 --> 00:22:40,967
Everybody's attention, please.

277
00:22:42,175 --> 00:22:43,870
All right, please listen.

278
00:22:45,345 --> 00:22:46,869
Hey, listen up!

279
00:22:48,681 --> 00:22:50,308
What is going on?

280
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:52,884
We are on an Ancient spaceship.

281
00:22:53,386 --> 00:22:55,718
- MAN: What?
- That's all I've got.

282
00:22:55,855 --> 00:22:57,049
Now, what that means is that...

283
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,886
That means you need to use the stargate
to get us all back home.

284
00:23:00,026 --> 00:23:01,755
That is definitely
on the list of things to do, sir,

285
00:23:01,895 --> 00:23:03,863
- but I think right now...
- You can consider that an order.

286
00:23:03,963 --> 00:23:05,260
We are working on it, sir.

287
00:23:05,398 --> 00:23:08,333
Now, I need to speak to the person
responsible for this. Where is Dr. Rush?

288
00:23:08,434 --> 00:23:12,063
- Just shut up for a second, will you!
- How dare you talk to...

289
00:23:12,205 --> 00:23:14,605
- Dad? Dad, please.
- WOMAN: Medic!

290
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:17,676
- Water? Water? Quickly. Over here.
- Get...

291
00:23:17,777 --> 00:23:20,541
CHLOE: Sit down.
ARMSTRONG: The pills.

292
00:23:23,616 --> 00:23:27,450
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to explain the situation.

293
00:23:28,221 --> 00:23:33,716
We are on a ship, but we have no idea
where we are in relation to Earth.

294
00:23:33,826 --> 00:23:35,293
Now, with respect, sir,

295
00:23:35,428 --> 00:23:38,124
the reason you might be having
a hard time breathing right now

296
00:23:38,264 --> 00:23:43,224
is because the ship's life-support system
is not functioning properly.

297
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:46,571
Dr. Rush is working on that right now.

298
00:23:48,474 --> 00:23:49,463
Brody and Park?

299
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:50,735
- Here!
- Here.

300
00:23:50,843 --> 00:23:52,276
Okay, good, you two are with me.

301
00:23:52,412 --> 00:23:56,246
- But these consoles just came on.
- No, nobody touch anything yet!

302
00:23:56,349 --> 00:23:58,078
Dr. Rush needs your help.

303
00:23:58,184 --> 00:24:03,212
Everybody else, just stay calm,
stay put. Please.

304
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:07,717
MAN: "Stay put"? Wait, what do
you mean? You're just going like that?

305
00:24:08,361 --> 00:24:10,761
There has to be
a mistake in here somewhere.

306
00:24:10,863 --> 00:24:13,627
Seriously, who uses
a whiteboard anymore?

307
00:24:13,766 --> 00:24:16,234
You have computers, like,
everywhere around here.

308
00:24:16,336 --> 00:24:20,466
The power flow was in the target range.
Why wouldn't the address connect?

309
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,964
Wrong address?

310
00:24:22,108 --> 00:24:24,440
There is only one found
in the Ancient database in Atlantis.

311
00:24:24,544 --> 00:24:25,738
With no other instructions?

312
00:24:25,845 --> 00:24:28,905
No, but that's not the issue.
It has to be your proof.

313
00:24:29,015 --> 00:24:31,779
My proof works.
You know how I know that it does?

314
00:24:31,884 --> 00:24:33,146
Because you said so.

315
00:24:33,286 --> 00:24:35,254
Gentlemen. How's it coming?

316
00:24:36,522 --> 00:24:38,456
- Whoa, whoa! What are you doing?
- Starting from the beginning.

317
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:40,082
Wait. Save! Save! Save! I can't...

318
00:24:40,193 --> 00:24:43,128
Mr. Wallace, I would like you to join me
for dinner in the officers' mess.

319
00:24:43,229 --> 00:24:44,321
- Thank you, I'm starving.
- We're quite close

320
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,796
to a breakthrough, actually.
I'd like Eli to keep working.

321
00:24:46,899 --> 00:24:49,993
Well, we've been here for six months.
It can wait a few more hours.

322
00:24:52,405 --> 00:24:53,429
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

323
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:06,099
So, Colonel, you really have no idea

324
00:25:06,202 --> 00:25:09,694
where this ninth chevron stargate address
is gonna send you?

325
00:25:10,372 --> 00:25:11,634
No idea at all.

326
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,934
Hmm.

327
00:25:13,042 --> 00:25:15,977
But the Ancients built the stargate
with nine chevrons.

328
00:25:16,078 --> 00:25:17,067
It's got to go somewhere.

329
00:25:48,961 --> 00:25:50,792
YOUNG: We've also known
for some time that the only way

330
00:25:50,896 --> 00:25:53,865
to unlock the ninth chevron
was to solve the power issues.

331
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,094
Well, if anyone's going to solve it,
I think Eli will.

332
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:02,368
Yes, that's right. It's true. I am Math Boy.

333
00:26:06,545 --> 00:26:10,106
Dr. Rush. Dr. Rush!

334
00:26:16,355 --> 00:26:17,617
ARMSTRONG: I would like
to propose a toast.

335
00:26:17,723 --> 00:26:19,782
Oh, no, that's really not necessary.

336
00:26:19,892 --> 00:26:21,382
- Not to you.
- Oh.

337
00:26:23,329 --> 00:26:25,456
When the proposal for this project
first crossed my desk,

338
00:26:25,564 --> 00:26:26,656
I did not want to approve it.

339
00:26:26,766 --> 00:26:28,631
- Oh, my God.
- It seemed clear to me at the time

340
00:26:28,734 --> 00:26:30,668
that there were enough
terrestrial matters of importance

341
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:33,364
that needed that kind of money.

342
00:26:33,506 --> 00:26:36,475
Now, being a proud father of
a beautiful young woman is one thing.

343
00:26:36,575 --> 00:26:42,639
Having that young woman exceed every
possible expectation is quite another.

344
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,527
It was my daughter, Chloe, who reminded
me that there is no greater endeavor

345
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:33,928
than seeking an understanding
of who we are,

346
00:27:34,066 --> 00:27:35,931
and the mysteries of the universe
in which we all exist.

347
00:27:36,068 --> 00:27:38,593
- Not in those exact words.
- It was also her idea

348
00:27:38,737 --> 00:27:41,570
to embed the Ancient proof
in a medium that would give us access

349
00:27:41,674 --> 00:27:44,575
to brilliant young minds
that we would have otherwise overlooked.

350
00:27:44,677 --> 00:27:48,135
And so to all the brave men and women
who have volunteered...

351
00:27:50,749 --> 00:27:51,875
Okay, what was that?

352
00:27:53,486 --> 00:27:55,078
This is Young.

353
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:02,054
YOUNG: The base is under attack.

354
00:28:02,161 --> 00:28:04,891
All non-combatant personnel
report to your designated areas.

355
00:28:04,997 --> 00:28:07,795
Everyone else to your battle stations.
This is not a drill.

356
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:10,299
Senator, I need you and your daughter
to go with Lieutenant Scott.

357
00:28:10,436 --> 00:28:12,165
- Eli! You as well.
- Oh, yeah.

358
00:28:13,205 --> 00:28:15,469
WOMAN: Hurry.
SCOTT: Yeah, we're on our way.

359
00:28:22,882 --> 00:28:23,974
GREER: What's going on in here?

360
00:28:26,452 --> 00:28:28,352
The life-support system is on,

361
00:28:28,487 --> 00:28:31,820
but for some reason,
it's not working properly.

362
00:28:31,957 --> 00:28:34,118
I'm attempting to reset it.

363
00:28:34,226 --> 00:28:35,784
He has no idea what he's doing.

364
00:28:37,696 --> 00:28:40,426
- Step away from that thing.
- ELI: That screen says

365
00:28:40,533 --> 00:28:41,659
that what you're doing
is gonna overload it...

366
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,290
- Eli, please!
- Is that what it says or not?

367
00:28:43,402 --> 00:28:45,336
You only think you know what it says
in this screen

368
00:28:45,471 --> 00:28:49,703
because I embedded a rudimentary version
of the Ancient language into the game.

369
00:28:49,842 --> 00:28:51,867
- This is not a game.
- Don't touch it, Rush.

370
00:28:52,011 --> 00:28:55,174
When the oxygen aboard this ship
falls below critical level,

371
00:28:55,314 --> 00:28:57,339
it will become increasingly
difficult to concentrate.

372
00:28:57,483 --> 00:28:59,815
And what you're doing
could blow up the whole ship.

373
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,320
- Are you sure, Eli?
- Back off now or I will shoot!

374
00:29:03,422 --> 00:29:04,480
Lower your weapon, Sergeant!

375
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:08,048
He already screwed us once.
I'm not going to let him do it again!

376
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,956
I need to get through, people. Stand aside.

377
00:29:17,536 --> 00:29:21,165
Sergeant, we're under attack.
Don't know who, don't know why.

378
00:29:21,874 --> 00:29:25,002
Consider the charges dropped.
Go take your anger out on them.

379
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,509
Yes, sir.

380
00:29:36,188 --> 00:29:37,883
YOUNG ON RADIO: What do we got,
Colonel, Lucian Alliance?

381
00:29:38,023 --> 00:29:40,514
That would be my guess.
They haven't introduced themselves.

382
00:29:40,626 --> 00:29:43,094
They started shooting the minute
they came out of hyperspace.

383
00:29:43,429 --> 00:29:45,863
Our shields are holding,
but we're not the target.

384
00:29:46,365 --> 00:29:47,491
What's heading our way?

385
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,795
A full squadron of gliders
and a troop transport.

386
00:29:50,069 --> 00:29:52,435
We cut them down some,
but the rest will be on your doorstep

387
00:29:52,571 --> 00:29:53,538
in less than three minutes.

388
00:29:53,872 --> 00:29:55,305
- Telford, did you copy?
- Roger that.

389
00:29:55,407 --> 00:29:58,205
If we can get to the transport before they
land their troops, we stand a chance.

390
00:29:59,961 --> 00:30:01,394
RUSH: I am going to press that button.

391
00:30:01,495 --> 00:30:05,761
It's going to fix the life support,
and then you and I, and everyone else,

392
00:30:05,866 --> 00:30:08,733
will be able to breathe and think
much better.

393
00:30:09,837 --> 00:30:10,997
Don't do it.

394
00:30:15,343 --> 00:30:21,248
Okay, look. Sergeant,
I know we are in a tough situation here,

395
00:30:21,349 --> 00:30:26,685
but I am giving you an order.
Lower your weapon.

396
00:30:48,192 --> 00:30:49,454
So?

397
00:30:49,594 --> 00:30:51,585
Well, I suppose
that would have been too simple.

398
00:30:57,034 --> 00:30:58,763
Apparently, that did nothing.

399
00:31:05,176 --> 00:31:08,236
This may take a little more time, T.J.
Hang in there.

400
00:31:09,547 --> 00:31:10,809
Copy.

401
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:15,080
Does Colonel Young know about this?

402
00:31:15,186 --> 00:31:16,585
He knows.

403
00:31:16,687 --> 00:31:21,124
Two weeks ago you told me that this
was the best experience of your life.

404
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:24,653
- Something must have happened.
- The scholarship came in.

405
00:31:25,963 --> 00:31:29,091
I guess I've just been too afraid
to admit what I really want.

406
00:31:30,468 --> 00:31:33,130
Wow, you didn't tell me
you had even applied.

407
00:31:33,237 --> 00:31:35,967
There's nothing else going on.
You know I'd tell you.

408
00:31:36,073 --> 00:31:38,871
- Unless you were protecting someone else.
- I'm not.

409
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:42,235
Like I said, I just hadn't made up my mind.

410
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:18,214
RILEY: Dr. Rush? I'm reading
a dangerous energy spike in the core.

411
00:32:19,784 --> 00:32:22,810
Eli! Eli! I need your help.

412
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,911
- With what?
- The ninth chevron.

413
00:32:25,056 --> 00:32:26,887
What? We need to get the hell out of here.

414
00:32:27,024 --> 00:32:29,822
Look, it took us two years to find this site.
The properties are unique.

415
00:32:29,927 --> 00:32:31,019
This may be our last chance.

416
00:32:33,464 --> 00:32:36,865
If this bombardment continues,
the radioactive core is going to go critical.

417
00:32:36,968 --> 00:32:38,993
You mean the planet...
It's going to explode?

418
00:32:39,103 --> 00:32:42,095
- Yes.
- Ah! Okay, okay, okay, okay.

419
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,037
- If my math works...
- We can't assume that...

420
00:32:44,141 --> 00:32:48,043
I said "if"! Then if it works,
then it's not a power supply issue,

421
00:32:48,145 --> 00:32:49,237
it's the gate address.

422
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,847
We've known the first eight symbols
for years,

423
00:32:50,948 --> 00:32:52,438
the ninth has to be the point of origin.

424
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:55,746
So, what if we're not on the planet
you're supposed to be dialing from?

425
00:32:55,886 --> 00:32:56,875
This is where we are.

426
00:32:56,988 --> 00:32:59,616
Okay, what if
we are not supposed to be here?

427
00:33:05,263 --> 00:33:08,096
Icarus Base, Telford.
We can't hold them back.

428
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,032
Let's go! Go!

429
00:33:24,782 --> 00:33:27,751
Sergeant Riley, dial the stargate to Earth!

430
00:33:29,854 --> 00:33:31,651
- SOLDIER: Incoming!
- Come on, come on.

431
00:33:40,865 --> 00:33:42,332
RILEY: Chevron one locked.

432
00:33:42,466 --> 00:33:44,434
ELI: Okay, follow me.
The symbols on the stargate

433
00:33:44,535 --> 00:33:45,763
are constellations as seen from Earth.

434
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,132
- That's what you said...
- Yes, yes.

435
00:33:47,238 --> 00:33:49,763
Okay, so what if Earth is supposed to be
the point of origin?

436
00:33:49,874 --> 00:33:52,900
- RILEY: Chevron two locked.
- The only viable power source was here,

437
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:54,841
- light years away.
- What if that doesn't matter?

438
00:33:54,979 --> 00:33:58,642
What if it's the only combination
that will work, like a code?

439
00:33:58,783 --> 00:34:00,910
- RILEY: Chevron three locked.
- A code?

440
00:34:01,018 --> 00:34:03,282
- Yeah.
- RILEY: Chevron four encoded.

441
00:34:04,288 --> 00:34:06,017
- Stop the dialing sequence.
- RILEY: I have my orders.

442
00:34:06,157 --> 00:34:10,184
Get out of my way. Get out of the way!
We can't risk dialing Earth.

443
00:34:19,036 --> 00:34:20,333
ARMSTRONG: Come on, let's go.

444
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,040
SCOTT: Go, go, keep moving.

445
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,592
- Dad? Dad? Dad!
- SCOTT: Chloe!

446
00:34:37,037 --> 00:34:39,801
My father! There could still be
people trapped on the other side.

447
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:43,307
All right, let's go, people.
You need to move it to the Gate Room!

448
00:34:43,444 --> 00:34:47,380
This is Scott. I got about a dozen
or so people cut off from the Gate Room,

449
00:34:47,481 --> 00:34:49,210
southeast corridor.

450
00:34:51,985 --> 00:34:56,046
- Oh, God! Okay. Damn it!
- YOUNG: Oh, my God!

451
00:34:56,156 --> 00:34:58,681
- Is that Dr. Simms?
- Stay with me, okay?

452
00:34:58,826 --> 00:35:00,987
He was helping pull people back
from the surface.

453
00:35:04,398 --> 00:35:06,628
- Simms, can you hear me?
- T.J.

454
00:35:07,868 --> 00:35:09,130
- T.J.
- No!

455
00:35:10,037 --> 00:35:14,337
Hey, Tamara. Hey, Tamara.

456
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,171
Come on, we got to go.

457
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,277
That is impressive.

458
00:35:57,551 --> 00:35:59,610
The power's fluctuating at critical levels.

459
00:36:00,721 --> 00:36:04,179
Colonel, I'm detecting a massive buildup
of energy from the planet.

460
00:36:06,126 --> 00:36:08,390
Recall our fighters. Radio Colonel Telford.

461
00:36:08,495 --> 00:36:11,259
He's got two minutes to get his people
aboard before we jump to hyperspace.

462
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,649
What's everybody doing?
I ordered an evacuation.

463
00:36:18,122 --> 00:36:21,649
He, uh... He didn't dial Earth.
It's the ninth chevron address.

464
00:36:21,759 --> 00:36:22,885
What?

465
00:36:23,961 --> 00:36:26,589
The attack started a chain reaction
in the planet's core.

466
00:36:26,731 --> 00:36:27,857
There's no way of stopping that.

467
00:36:27,965 --> 00:36:30,559
And any blast could easily translate
through an open wormhole.

468
00:36:30,702 --> 00:36:31,828
It's too dangerous to dial Earth.

469
00:36:31,936 --> 00:36:33,699
You could have dialed somewhere else.
Anywhere else.

470
00:36:33,805 --> 00:36:35,773
- RUSH: This could be our only chance.
- Shut it down.

471
00:36:35,907 --> 00:36:37,033
- You can't, it's too late.
- Riley!

472
00:36:37,141 --> 00:36:39,609
- System's not responding, sir.
- I need to get these people out of here.

473
00:36:39,744 --> 00:36:41,575
- We have a way out.
- We don't know what's on the other side!

474
00:36:41,713 --> 00:36:44,580
- Damn it, Rush!
- Can't be worse than here, can it?

475
00:36:51,823 --> 00:36:54,792
Nobody move. Await further instructions.

476
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:03,930
What's that?
Well, it doesn't look like life support.

477
00:37:04,068 --> 00:37:05,535
RUSH: Yes, I realize that.

478
00:37:08,106 --> 00:37:09,300
Whoa!

479
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:18,106
- What are we looking at?
- It's a star map.

480
00:37:20,184 --> 00:37:21,742
PARK: That's the Milky Way.

481
00:37:22,587 --> 00:37:25,556
RUSH: I believe it's a visual log
of the ship's journey.

482
00:37:26,257 --> 00:37:27,588
So, this is where we are now?

483
00:37:29,293 --> 00:37:32,956
No. That's where the ship
originally embarked from.

484
00:37:33,765 --> 00:37:35,130
ELI: Earth.

485
00:37:35,933 --> 00:37:39,596
- It's leaving the galaxy.
- RUSH: It did. Long ago.

486
00:37:39,704 --> 00:37:41,569
That was Pegasus.

487
00:37:41,672 --> 00:37:44,436
So, those points are more stars?

488
00:37:44,542 --> 00:37:47,409
No, they're galaxies.

489
00:37:51,616 --> 00:37:54,915
Rush, where the hell are we?

490
00:37:57,021 --> 00:37:59,489
Several billion light years from home.

491
00:38:04,962 --> 00:38:07,260
- Please.
- YOUNG: Scott.

492
00:38:09,233 --> 00:38:10,530
Stand clear.

493
00:38:13,538 --> 00:38:14,869
You could take down the rest of the roof
with that.

494
00:38:15,006 --> 00:38:16,030
Look, we don't have time to argue.

495
00:38:16,174 --> 00:38:19,200
I need you to lead the evacuees
through the gate. You need to go with him.

496
00:38:19,343 --> 00:38:21,641
No! I'm staying here
until I know my father's okay.

497
00:38:21,746 --> 00:38:25,011
Make sure everyone carries as much
of the expedition supplies as they can.

498
00:38:25,149 --> 00:38:26,980
- Why?
- 'Cause you're not going to Earth.

499
00:38:27,084 --> 00:38:29,484
Rush dialed the ninth chevron. Go.

500
00:38:31,322 --> 00:38:32,516
Go!

501
00:38:44,502 --> 00:38:48,734
Once I'm through,
follow one at a time on a three-count.

502
00:39:05,523 --> 00:39:07,821
SOLDIER: Okay, people. Make way.

503
00:39:14,232 --> 00:39:16,860
Come on, let's go. Keep it going.

504
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,367
You good? Okay, let's go.

505
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,877
If you can hear me, stand back!

506
00:39:33,751 --> 00:39:35,742
Okay, get down.

507
00:39:36,888 --> 00:39:38,185
Fire in the hole!

508
00:39:45,096 --> 00:39:46,256
Dad?

509
00:39:49,634 --> 00:39:50,692
Dad?

510
00:39:50,801 --> 00:39:52,166
GREER: Put your weight on me.

511
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:54,329
- Put your weight on me.
- YOUNG: Stay calm, everybody.

512
00:39:57,108 --> 00:39:58,575
- I got you.
- CHLOE: Please.

513
00:40:08,019 --> 00:40:10,647
Okay, everybody stay calm! Don't push.

514
00:40:23,801 --> 00:40:24,995
Dad!

515
00:40:25,403 --> 00:40:27,928
Careful, careful.

516
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:30,234
- YOUNG: You're okay, sir.
- Are you okay?

517
00:40:30,341 --> 00:40:32,741
I'm the last one. I'm all right.

518
00:40:34,111 --> 00:40:35,510
Greer, go. I'm right behind you.

519
00:40:38,182 --> 00:40:42,846
Hammond, this is Young, come in.
Hammond, this is Young. Come in.

520
00:40:43,788 --> 00:40:48,350
GREER: Let's go, let's go, let's go,
come on, people. Let's do it. Let's do it.

521
00:40:48,492 --> 00:40:49,516
SOLDIER: Hurry up!

522
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,177
- Sir!
- Go!

523
00:41:50,121 --> 00:41:55,024
Sir. We've got Colonel Carter. On screen.

524
00:41:56,927 --> 00:42:00,021
General, we barely got away.
The planet was destroyed.

525
00:42:00,765 --> 00:42:02,824
We managed to beam
most of our people off the surface

526
00:42:02,933 --> 00:42:04,457
before jumping to hyperspace.

527
00:42:04,769 --> 00:42:07,738
We also believe that
the enemy forces were destroyed.

528
00:42:08,372 --> 00:42:11,170
Any word on how they gained intel
on our base?

529
00:42:11,275 --> 00:42:12,367
No.

530
00:42:12,476 --> 00:42:13,943
What about casualties?

531
00:42:14,078 --> 00:42:16,945
Twelve. Eighty-plus MIA.

532
00:42:17,081 --> 00:42:18,378
The bunker-shielding technology

533
00:42:18,482 --> 00:42:21,451
prevented us
from beaming out anyone inside.

534
00:42:21,585 --> 00:42:23,314
How many people made it
through the gate to Earth?

535
00:42:23,788 --> 00:42:24,777
None.

536
00:42:24,922 --> 00:42:28,255
None? Our sensors indicated
that the stargate was active

537
00:42:28,392 --> 00:42:30,622
for a full six minutes
before the core went critical.

538
00:42:30,761 --> 00:42:32,558
Well, they didn't come through here.

539
00:42:32,997 --> 00:42:34,521
Then where'd they go?

540
00:42:42,956 --> 00:42:44,651
Okay, listen up!

541
00:42:44,758 --> 00:42:49,422
Everybody who is able, we are going
to search this ship top to bottom.

542
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:50,861
Teams of three.

543
00:42:52,699 --> 00:42:56,191
- Weapons?
- Twenty-three, including handguns.

544
00:42:57,304 --> 00:42:59,135
- One per group?
- Yeah.

545
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:05,972
Flashlights, radios, only when necessary.
Once those batteries are dead,

546
00:43:06,113 --> 00:43:09,514
they are dead. Regular check-ins
with Dr. Rush in the control room

547
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:13,051
every 10 minutes, and keep in mind,
as far as we know,

548
00:43:13,187 --> 00:43:16,452
this bucket is really freaking old,
and there may be areas of damage

549
00:43:16,557 --> 00:43:18,684
where life support is unstable.

550
00:43:18,826 --> 00:43:20,817
And, look, be smart, okay?

551
00:43:20,928 --> 00:43:23,658
Don't touch anything that
looks like it might be dangerous.

552
00:43:23,797 --> 00:43:26,027
How are we supposed to know
what's dangerous?

553
00:43:26,166 --> 00:43:29,067
- Becker, right?
- Yes, sir. I work in the mess.

554
00:43:29,736 --> 00:43:33,172
- I mean, I did.
- Well, don't touch, just look.

555
00:43:34,708 --> 00:43:38,041
You're... You're James, right?

556
00:43:38,178 --> 00:43:41,477
- Yes, Lieutenant.
- You and Riley are with me.

557
00:43:42,349 --> 00:43:45,113
Subtle, man. Subtle.

558
00:43:45,219 --> 00:43:48,552
SCOTT: If it's okay with you, sir, it might be
best, considering your obvious skills,

559
00:43:48,689 --> 00:43:52,147
for you to hang back here and
help keep the rest of these people calm.

560
00:43:52,259 --> 00:43:53,658
Don't patronize me, son.

561
00:43:55,062 --> 00:43:56,290
No, sir.

562
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,619
- Are you all right?
- I'm solid, Lieutenant.

563
00:45:29,756 --> 00:45:31,724
I'm trained for this.

564
00:45:32,826 --> 00:45:35,693
- Look, I didn't mean to...
- Look, not now.

565
00:45:42,936 --> 00:45:44,836
ON RADIO: Rush, this is Scott. Come in.

566
00:45:47,274 --> 00:45:49,174
Rush, this is Scott. Come in.

567
00:45:51,478 --> 00:45:53,173
Hello. This is Eli.

568
00:45:53,313 --> 00:45:56,646
- Where's Rush?
- Bathroom, if he found it.

569
00:45:58,986 --> 00:46:01,978
I'm at what looks like a bulkhead door.
It won't open.

570
00:46:02,122 --> 00:46:05,114
I was hoping
Rush could open it from there.

571
00:46:05,225 --> 00:46:06,351
Should I find him?

572
00:46:07,794 --> 00:46:08,988
No.

573
00:46:15,202 --> 00:46:17,432
- Here, give me a hand.
- What happened to being smart?

574
00:46:17,537 --> 00:46:18,936
This could be the engine room
for all we know.

575
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:20,836
We got to at least open a few doors.

576
00:46:20,974 --> 00:46:22,839
Do we? Do we really?

577
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:32,130
ELI: Hang on.

578
00:46:33,436 --> 00:46:35,461
No, keep doing what you're doing.

579
00:46:36,939 --> 00:46:39,999
I think I found where you are.
The door is flashing red.

580
00:46:40,142 --> 00:46:41,939
SCOTT: Can you open it from there?

581
00:46:42,044 --> 00:46:43,807
Red is usually bad, isn't it?

582
00:46:43,946 --> 00:46:46,506
Maybe it means the door is stuck. Just try.

583
00:46:48,851 --> 00:46:51,081
Okay. You should probably step back.

584
00:47:01,297 --> 00:47:03,822
Whoa, whoa, whoa, not good! Not good.
More red...

585
00:47:08,704 --> 00:47:09,693
Close it!

586
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:11,363
- Close it now!
- I'm trying!

587
00:47:19,649 --> 00:47:22,675
Yeah. Okay. We established
why that hatch was closed.

588
00:47:23,185 --> 00:47:25,847
Yeah. A lot of others are closed
for the same reason.

589
00:47:25,988 --> 00:47:27,956
We're only occupying
a fraction of the ship right now.

590
00:47:28,057 --> 00:47:30,184
It just goes on forever.

591
00:47:30,326 --> 00:47:32,385
But if there are damaged areas of the ship
that aren't sealed,

592
00:47:32,528 --> 00:47:34,291
that could be our problem.

593
00:47:35,731 --> 00:47:39,189
Oh, hey, good timing.
We just found... Hey... Really?

594
00:47:39,735 --> 00:47:42,499
This is Dr. Rush.
Meet me in the Gate Room immediately.

595
00:47:43,572 --> 00:47:44,630
Everyone.

596
00:47:45,741 --> 00:47:48,505
MAN 1: I don't know what's going on.
MAN 2: It's over there.

597
00:47:51,947 --> 00:47:53,574
What's going on?

598
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:59,215
In this case are
five Ancient communication stones.

599
00:48:00,389 --> 00:48:03,654
They work over vast distances in real time.

600
00:48:03,759 --> 00:48:06,250
- We can talk to the people on Earth.
- Yes.

601
00:48:06,395 --> 00:48:07,521
MAN 1: Great.
MAN 2: All right.

602
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:11,031
RUSH: You physically take control
of an individual at the other end.

603
00:48:11,801 --> 00:48:13,564
I brought these with us in the event

604
00:48:13,703 --> 00:48:16,228
we ended up somewhere out of range
of normal communication.

605
00:48:16,372 --> 00:48:17,361
So let's use them.

606
00:48:17,473 --> 00:48:18,497
MAN: Yeah.
WOMAN: Yeah.

607
00:48:18,908 --> 00:48:20,068
I already have.

608
00:48:20,209 --> 00:48:22,575
ALL: What? When?

609
00:48:22,712 --> 00:48:25,408
- Are they sending help?
- No.

610
00:48:26,082 --> 00:48:27,208
MAN: Why? Why are they not sending help?

611
00:48:27,316 --> 00:48:30,444
The only means of dialing
this gate from our galaxy

612
00:48:30,586 --> 00:48:33,749
was destroyed in the attack. We're cut off.

613
00:48:35,124 --> 00:48:36,557
I want to use one of those stones now.

614
00:48:36,659 --> 00:48:39,287
- I have spoken with General O'Neill...
- I am a United States senator!

615
00:48:39,428 --> 00:48:41,453
I've explained our situation clearly.

616
00:48:41,597 --> 00:48:45,931
In light of my knowledge and experience,
he has placed me in charge.

617
00:48:46,068 --> 00:48:47,262
He did what?

618
00:48:48,838 --> 00:48:50,135
MAN: How do we know?

619
00:48:50,272 --> 00:48:55,904
I have faith in our ability to repair this ship
and to work together,

620
00:48:56,245 --> 00:49:00,272
but if we're to survive this,
we need leadership

621
00:49:00,416 --> 00:49:02,043
and a clear chain of command.

622
00:49:02,151 --> 00:49:04,551
ELI: We only have a few hours of air left.

623
00:49:04,653 --> 00:49:06,245
- Yeah.
- I want to speak to the General myself.

624
00:49:06,355 --> 00:49:08,323
- Senator, please.
- Give it to him!

625
00:49:08,457 --> 00:49:10,049
WOMAN: Yeah.
SCOTT: Give it to him.

626
00:49:12,428 --> 00:49:15,488
- CHLOE: Dad? Dad!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. T.J.?

627
00:49:15,631 --> 00:49:19,067
Excuse me, excuse me. Okay.
Okay, he's still breathing.

628
00:49:20,369 --> 00:49:23,099
CHLOE: Oh, my God!
JOHANSEN: I saw him taking some pills?

629
00:49:23,205 --> 00:49:24,797
CHLOE: Warfarin, for his heart.

630
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:27,841
Blood thinners are the last thing he needs
if he's bleeding internally.

631
00:49:27,977 --> 00:49:30,138
- Please do something!
- Look, I told you, I'm just a medic.

632
00:49:30,279 --> 00:49:34,682
Everyone, please, there's no need for us all
to congregate in the one place.

633
00:49:35,151 --> 00:49:38,985
Ms. Johansen, please find
adequate accommodation for the injured,

634
00:49:39,121 --> 00:49:41,589
- and everyone else...
- No, I don't recognize your authority,

635
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:44,488
- Dr. Rush. As an IOA representative...
- We have found quarters nearby

636
00:49:44,627 --> 00:49:46,788
- much more comfortable. Please go there...
- I think you need to...

637
00:49:46,896 --> 00:49:50,195
...and stay there until you're asked
to do something useful.

638
00:49:50,332 --> 00:49:52,323
Something useful?

639
00:49:52,468 --> 00:49:54,800
We do not want to settle in!

640
00:49:54,904 --> 00:49:57,372
- We want to get back! Right?
- Yeah.

641
00:49:57,506 --> 00:49:59,701
We should be working on getting home.

642
00:49:59,842 --> 00:50:02,276
- WRAY: Exactly.
- I'm not sure if that's even possible.

643
00:50:02,378 --> 00:50:04,107
What? You haven't even tried!

644
00:50:04,213 --> 00:50:06,647
Maybe you should actually do something
instead of standing around,

645
00:50:06,749 --> 00:50:09,684
- talking about being in charge.
- If that's even true.

646
00:50:09,819 --> 00:50:15,553
Everybody! Everyone, calm down!
Now, the fact is

647
00:50:17,526 --> 00:50:19,790
Colonel Young put me in charge,

648
00:50:19,895 --> 00:50:24,229
and I expect all SG personnel
to follow my orders.

649
00:50:24,366 --> 00:50:28,632
As for the rest of you, you get out of line,
we will lock you down.

650
00:50:33,375 --> 00:50:36,469
Now, Dr. Rush is right
about a couple things.

651
00:50:36,579 --> 00:50:39,047
First off, we all have to work together,

652
00:50:40,282 --> 00:50:44,742
and second of all, we don't all have
to stay here, so let's move out.

653
00:50:48,457 --> 00:50:50,925
- Go on, move. It's okay.
- SOLDIER 1: All right. You heard him.

654
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:52,652
SOLDIER 2: Do as he says, people.

655
00:50:57,366 --> 00:51:01,325
I think we need you,
so I've got your back for now,

656
00:51:01,437 --> 00:51:05,498
but if I were you, I would find some way
to dial that gate back to Earth.

657
00:51:21,824 --> 00:51:25,123
I've got some testing equipment over here.
Looks broken.

658
00:51:25,728 --> 00:51:28,595
- We'll get back to that.
- What about all these Ancient crates?

659
00:51:28,731 --> 00:51:30,722
If it's not ours, don't touch it.

660
00:51:30,833 --> 00:51:32,892
VOLKER: Did no one think
of labeling anything?

661
00:51:33,002 --> 00:51:34,731
Every case has a bar code.

662
00:51:34,837 --> 00:51:37,704
All right, anyone find a bar code reader?

663
00:51:37,806 --> 00:51:39,933
I guess that got left behind
along with the food and water.

664
00:51:40,075 --> 00:51:44,068
- Uh-uh. We got food.
- Yeah, protein bars and this powdered stuff.

665
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,577
Look, everybody.

666
00:51:45,681 --> 00:51:47,615
Seeds? Volker, you've got to be kidding.

667
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:48,978
PALMER: I got a case of blank paper.

668
00:51:49,118 --> 00:51:51,052
VOLKER: Maybe we should
start a suggestion box.

669
00:51:51,153 --> 00:51:52,620
What are you staring at?

670
00:51:55,457 --> 00:51:58,824
- You were in detention.
- Yeah.

671
00:51:59,128 --> 00:52:01,596
- For good reason.
- GREER: What did you want him to do?

672
00:52:01,697 --> 00:52:05,292
- Leave me there?
- Of course not.

673
00:52:06,168 --> 00:52:08,398
I was just wondering
what to do about it now.

674
00:52:10,105 --> 00:52:13,563
- That's not up to you.
- We'll see.

675
00:52:17,546 --> 00:52:19,480
No, no, no. Don't do it, man.

676
00:52:21,483 --> 00:52:23,917
SCOTT ON RADIO: Greer, I need you
to check for any open bulkhead doors

677
00:52:24,019 --> 00:52:27,420
that lead to damaged parts of the ship.
Rush will direct you.

678
00:52:27,523 --> 00:52:28,649
Copy.

679
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,600
RUSH ON RADIO: There should be
an elevator directly ahead.

680
00:52:48,143 --> 00:52:49,337
Copy that.

681
00:53:10,499 --> 00:53:14,230
- Are you there yet?
- This is Scott. Radio silence, please.

682
00:53:24,013 --> 00:53:26,982
- Hey.
- Hey.

683
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:29,517
What's going on?

684
00:53:33,222 --> 00:53:36,658
We almost lost you.
You were thrown clear across the room.

685
00:53:38,193 --> 00:53:39,558
- Where are we?
- Sir...

686
00:53:40,863 --> 00:53:43,388
- Where are we?
- We're on a ship.

687
00:53:43,532 --> 00:53:46,228
It's Ancient.
Rush says it's thousands of years old

688
00:53:46,368 --> 00:53:49,565
and we're pretty far off into the universe.

689
00:53:50,072 --> 00:53:52,905
- What's he doing to get us home?
- He says he's working on it,

690
00:53:53,042 --> 00:53:54,839
but we have bigger problems.

691
00:53:54,943 --> 00:53:57,036
The life-support system
isn't working properly.

692
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:00,246
If we can't get it fixed,
there's not much time.

693
00:54:00,949 --> 00:54:03,850
You should also know that he used
the communication stones to contact Earth,

694
00:54:03,952 --> 00:54:05,783
and he said General O'Neill
put him in charge.

695
00:54:05,921 --> 00:54:08,389
I don't think so. I don't think... Oh...

696
00:54:09,725 --> 00:54:12,353
Sir, you shouldn't be trying
to get up just yet, okay?

697
00:54:12,461 --> 00:54:16,192
I don't think I have a choice, T.J.
I can't feel my legs.

698
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:25,272
- Whoa, jeez!
- ELI: Whoa!

699
00:54:29,778 --> 00:54:31,245
What is that thing?

700
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:33,275
Come here, I'll show you.

701
00:54:40,189 --> 00:54:42,157
It's a... It's a camera.

702
00:54:43,325 --> 00:54:47,785
It's a flying camera. I'm calling it a Kino,
you know, after the Russian...

703
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:48,988
- Yeah.
- Okay.

704
00:54:49,131 --> 00:54:53,158
Well, I figure maybe we can use it
to check out the damaged areas of the ship.

705
00:54:53,302 --> 00:54:54,496
- That's good.
- Yeah.

706
00:54:54,937 --> 00:54:57,929
- That's good. Where's it going now?
- Oh, I don't know. It's just doing its thing,

707
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,974
but there's lots more of them.

708
00:55:11,854 --> 00:55:13,515
- Yeah, it's cool.
- Yeah!

709
00:55:14,556 --> 00:55:18,959
- Do you want one?
- It's not a gumball machine, Eli.

710
00:55:19,361 --> 00:55:20,453
Okay.

711
00:55:21,997 --> 00:55:23,157
- Okay!
- Okay, so you figured out

712
00:55:23,265 --> 00:55:27,065
where they keep the Kinos.
What else have you figured out?

713
00:55:34,576 --> 00:55:39,013
Give me a break, man. This is my second
spaceship, and my first was yesterday.

714
00:55:39,414 --> 00:55:44,977
I know. Icarus was my first SGC
assignment after training.

715
00:55:45,087 --> 00:55:48,056
I haven't been at this
much longer than you have.

716
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:50,181
Did they beam you out of your house?

717
00:55:50,325 --> 00:55:54,386
- No. You got me there.
- Got any food on you?

718
00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:56,555
- No.
- Tylenol?

719
00:55:56,698 --> 00:55:58,666
- Headache?
- Yeah.

720
00:55:58,767 --> 00:55:59,893
Me, too.

721
00:56:01,236 --> 00:56:05,400
Neuropraxia is temporary paralysis
that can follow a concussive injury.

722
00:56:05,541 --> 00:56:07,031
You don't know?

723
00:56:07,176 --> 00:56:10,145
You'd need an MRI and a qualified doctor
who knows how to read it

724
00:56:10,245 --> 00:56:12,509
to know for sure if there's spinal damage.

725
00:56:12,614 --> 00:56:13,979
We don't have either.

726
00:56:14,383 --> 00:56:16,578
Hopefully, it's just the nerves in shock.

727
00:56:16,718 --> 00:56:19,186
Best I can do is insist that you remain still.

728
00:56:20,789 --> 00:56:22,848
Your tour was over two weeks ago.

729
00:56:22,958 --> 00:56:25,586
You should be in some classroom
in San Diego.

730
00:56:26,929 --> 00:56:30,695
Seattle. That's where my scholarship was.

731
00:56:32,868 --> 00:56:36,565
- I'm sorry.
- That part's not your fault.

732
00:56:38,907 --> 00:56:40,397
Tell Rush I want to see him.

733
00:56:41,176 --> 00:56:42,404
Yes, sir.

734
00:56:48,083 --> 00:56:50,916
- What's that?
- Flying camera ball.

735
00:56:51,019 --> 00:56:53,146
- I'm calling it a Kino.
- Don't ask.

736
00:56:58,126 --> 00:57:00,617
- That's marvelous.
- It comes with a remote.

737
00:57:00,762 --> 00:57:03,253
I thought we could use it to look around.

738
00:57:05,868 --> 00:57:10,805
- What do you have?
- Well, it's not so good, really.

739
00:57:10,939 --> 00:57:15,967
These processing nodes are scrubbers,
responsible for cleaning CO2 from the air.

740
00:57:16,111 --> 00:57:20,605
Here, here, and here, it's indicating
malfunction. Others are failing.

741
00:57:22,784 --> 00:57:26,515
Greer, this is Scott. I'm heading
for the Gate Room. Meet me there.

742
00:57:27,489 --> 00:57:30,424
Look, I'm just saying
that she better stay out of my face.

743
00:57:30,525 --> 00:57:34,120
I'll remind her of your personal space issues
next chance I get.

744
00:57:37,799 --> 00:57:40,267
Dr. Rush? Colonel Young wants
to see you right away.

745
00:57:40,369 --> 00:57:42,633
There should be a kind of grate
covering the node.

746
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:03,355
RUSH: What do you see?

747
00:58:04,059 --> 00:58:05,458
SCOTT: A problem.

748
00:58:06,662 --> 00:58:08,789
We see a very big problem.

749
00:58:18,607 --> 00:58:20,131
What happened?

750
00:58:20,242 --> 00:58:23,336
You collapsed. We brought you here.

751
00:58:24,947 --> 00:58:28,906
- What's going on?
- I'm not sure. I've been here with you.

752
00:58:29,051 --> 00:58:32,214
I need to know what's happening, Chloe.
This is important.

753
00:58:32,354 --> 00:58:34,254
Dad, I was worried about you.

754
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:37,923
- Okay.
- And I'm scared.

755
00:58:40,896 --> 00:58:43,888
One step at a time, honey.
One step at a time.

756
00:58:47,402 --> 00:58:51,532
- My pills...
- No, Dad, you can't take any more of those.

757
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:54,700
Your ribs are badly bruised.
You will bleed internally.

758
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:57,938
If I don't take those pills, a bruise
is going to be the least of my problems.

759
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,377
I know.

760
00:59:01,049 --> 00:59:04,541
Don't worry about me. Go.
Find out what's going on out there.

761
00:59:04,653 --> 00:59:06,348
No, I want to be here with you.

762
00:59:06,455 --> 00:59:09,788
And I want you here, but right now,
I want to know what's going on

763
00:59:09,925 --> 00:59:11,586
just a little bit more.

764
00:59:13,862 --> 00:59:15,124
Okay.

765
00:59:15,230 --> 00:59:17,221
I'll be here when you get back.

766
00:59:17,332 --> 00:59:18,924
- Okay.
- Okay.

767
00:59:30,445 --> 00:59:32,037
- What's going on?
- I don't know, man.

768
00:59:32,147 --> 00:59:35,878
The air filter's full of crap. Come on.
They want us to keep looking.

769
00:59:35,984 --> 00:59:38,248
- Let's go.
- All right, okay.

770
00:59:43,458 --> 00:59:44,618
Alkaline.

771
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:47,126
Everyone's heart rates are elevated,
people are reporting headaches.

772
00:59:47,262 --> 00:59:48,752
- It has to be.
- What?

773
00:59:48,864 --> 00:59:51,264
The used-up residue
of whatever magic compound

774
00:59:51,366 --> 00:59:53,766
the Ancients used
to scrub CO2 from the air.

775
00:59:53,869 --> 00:59:56,838
So, now we have two big problems
relating to the life support.

776
00:59:56,972 --> 01:00:00,237
Our first priority must be to
seal off any of the leaks.

777
01:00:00,342 --> 01:00:03,800
If we can manage that, then we can
maybe buy ourselves a day or so

778
01:00:03,912 --> 01:00:06,403
before the buildup of CO2 kills us.

779
01:00:07,649 --> 01:00:11,244
- As it stands, how much time do we have?
- I don't know.

780
01:00:11,353 --> 01:00:12,479
Couple of hours at most.

781
01:00:12,621 --> 01:00:14,282
Huh. Awesome.

782
01:00:15,057 --> 01:00:19,460
Brody, there was some medical-grade
soda lime in the supply manifest?

783
01:00:19,795 --> 01:00:22,525
- It never made it.
- That's a pity.

784
01:00:26,401 --> 01:00:30,770
Well, in a ship this old

785
01:00:31,907 --> 01:00:35,138
there's bound to be systems
past their designed life.

786
01:00:35,243 --> 01:00:37,837
Okay, let's say we find the leaks.
Can you fix this?

787
01:00:38,647 --> 01:00:41,548
I doubt this stuff can be cooked off.

788
01:00:41,683 --> 01:00:45,483
Perhaps if there were stores
of this substance in a clean form,

789
01:00:45,587 --> 01:00:48,818
or something else capable of
CO2 sequestration, calcium carbonate,

790
01:00:48,924 --> 01:00:52,155
lithium hydroxide, then yes, "if."

791
01:00:52,727 --> 01:00:55,423
Okay, well, that's not going to matter
because you're going to get the gate

792
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:58,658
dialed back to Earth
before this becomes an issue,

793
01:00:58,767 --> 01:01:00,132
- Rush, right?
- Lieutenant...

794
01:01:01,203 --> 01:01:03,831
That's the kind of thing
you're taught to say in officer training,

795
01:01:03,939 --> 01:01:06,965
presumably for the benefit of
those who don't know any better.

796
01:01:19,421 --> 01:01:20,581
Please.

797
01:01:21,923 --> 01:01:23,754
What makes you think I won't try?

798
01:01:43,194 --> 01:01:45,856
Greer, I found what looks like a shuttle.

799
01:01:45,997 --> 01:01:49,831
Looks like there are two shuttles,
attached to individual docking sleeves.

800
01:01:50,401 --> 01:01:53,268
- We're all going to die.
- GREER: Shut up, Franklin.

801
01:01:53,371 --> 01:01:55,430
I'm just saying
what everyone's got to be thinking.

802
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:58,373
I said shut up,
or else you're going to be the first.

803
01:02:02,146 --> 01:02:03,135
This the door?

804
01:02:04,715 --> 01:02:07,183
Yeah, yeah, that's it. Can you close it?

805
01:02:11,155 --> 01:02:12,452
It won't close.

806
01:02:15,259 --> 01:02:17,022
We can't close it from here, either.

807
01:02:17,161 --> 01:02:19,391
There's something wrong
with the mechanism.

808
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:35,205
FRANKLIN: I think I found the leak.

809
01:02:37,981 --> 01:02:40,711
There's another door
on the back of the shuttle,

810
01:02:40,851 --> 01:02:42,318
but there's no control.

811
01:02:43,253 --> 01:02:45,653
Then maybe we can close it off locally.

812
01:02:48,325 --> 01:02:52,386
FRANKLIN: The shield keeping the air inside
is obviously not 100% effective.

813
01:02:53,363 --> 01:02:55,558
RUSH: Probably wasn't
designed to compensate

814
01:02:55,699 --> 01:02:57,724
for the amount of damage
the ship has sustained.

815
01:02:57,868 --> 01:02:59,893
FRANKLIN: Is there a way of boosting it?

816
01:03:00,037 --> 01:03:02,164
At least in the areas we need it?

817
01:03:02,472 --> 01:03:04,030
RUSH: We haven't found a way yet.

818
01:03:04,141 --> 01:03:06,109
It seems to be operating
at maximum capability.

819
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:12,314
ELI: Open the door!

820
01:03:17,254 --> 01:03:20,052
Well, that's not good.

821
01:03:29,466 --> 01:03:31,934
That's very good, sir. A very good sign.

822
01:03:32,669 --> 01:03:34,762
I don't have time for this, do I?

823
01:03:34,905 --> 01:03:37,567
Two problems. We're venting atmosphere
from a damaged shuttle,

824
01:03:37,708 --> 01:03:39,175
and even if we could seal it off,

825
01:03:39,276 --> 01:03:42,575
the life-support system in this ship
is past its expiration date.

826
01:03:43,113 --> 01:03:45,946
We'll build up CO2
to lethal levels within a day.

827
01:03:46,316 --> 01:03:47,874
Well, that explains the headache.

828
01:03:47,985 --> 01:03:49,452
You already had one.

829
01:03:49,953 --> 01:03:51,443
They'll find a way.
That's what these people do.

830
01:03:51,588 --> 01:03:53,647
Well, most of these people
aren't even supposed to be here.

831
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:56,953
- How did the ship get damaged?
- We don't know.

832
01:03:57,094 --> 01:04:01,030
It certainly looks like it's been through
a battle, at least the parts we can access.

833
01:04:01,131 --> 01:04:03,565
We're still cut off from most of the ship.
It's huge.

834
01:04:03,667 --> 01:04:06,602
They tried jamming something into
the shuttle doorway to keep it open

835
01:04:06,737 --> 01:04:08,830
long enough to let
the person inside get out...

836
01:04:08,972 --> 01:04:11,668
But it just opens again.

837
01:04:11,808 --> 01:04:13,969
Some sort of safety mechanism,
like an elevator.

838
01:04:14,111 --> 01:04:15,442
Rush says he can't override it.

839
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:17,747
How long do we have right now?

840
01:04:17,848 --> 01:04:19,008
As it stands...

841
01:04:19,149 --> 01:04:20,673
Rush says if we don't get it closed,
we've got...

842
01:04:20,817 --> 01:04:22,375
...just over an hour.

843
01:04:32,596 --> 01:04:34,496
Bad air's better than no air.

844
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,927
Guess a day's better than an hour.

845
01:04:40,871 --> 01:04:44,602
Someone's got to go in there
and close this door.

846
01:04:52,015 --> 01:04:53,846
My head is pounding.

847
01:04:53,984 --> 01:04:57,852
Heartbeat has accelerated.
It's getting harder and harder to breathe,

848
01:04:59,690 --> 01:05:02,955
as our very lives
are being vented out into space.

849
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:04,687
That is going to get old very fast.

850
01:05:04,828 --> 01:05:06,853
- This needs to be documented.
- No one's going to see that.

851
01:05:06,997 --> 01:05:08,328
How do you know?

852
01:05:10,734 --> 01:05:13,828
We made it here. Someone else could, too.

853
01:05:18,075 --> 01:05:22,011
If we die, maybe this can help them
to find out what happened to us.

854
01:05:22,145 --> 01:05:23,703
Yeah, well, we're not dead yet.

855
01:05:29,386 --> 01:05:30,648
I'm starting to have slightly blurred...

856
01:05:30,754 --> 01:05:31,948
- Eli!
- What?

857
01:05:36,093 --> 01:05:37,890
So how are we going to decide who?

858
01:05:38,028 --> 01:05:39,928
RUSH: I assume we're not going
to get any volunteers.

859
01:05:41,932 --> 01:05:44,230
What's another day going to buy us?

860
01:05:44,368 --> 01:05:46,632
Time, to find a way to survive.

861
01:05:48,705 --> 01:05:50,172
May I see the list?

862
01:05:52,175 --> 01:05:54,040
JOHANSEN: I marked the names
of anyone injured.

863
01:05:56,346 --> 01:06:00,840
Right. We have to find out people's
skills, background, experience...

864
01:06:00,951 --> 01:06:03,818
Doesn't take any special skills
to die from asphyxiation!

865
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:07,014
Look. What I'm saying is,
it shouldn't be someone

866
01:06:07,124 --> 01:06:09,058
with potentially valuable knowledge

867
01:06:09,192 --> 01:06:12,719
or abilities we might need
to help us survive beyond this.

868
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:14,353
Are you really suggesting

869
01:06:14,464 --> 01:06:15,795
- what I think...
- Half the people on this ship

870
01:06:15,932 --> 01:06:18,730
- already want to kill you.
- I don't care.

871
01:06:18,869 --> 01:06:22,168
You can't ask someone
to sacrifice themselves, period.

872
01:06:23,106 --> 01:06:26,439
Politicians ask military personnel
to sacrifice themselves

873
01:06:26,576 --> 01:06:29,044
for the good of others all the time.

874
01:06:29,146 --> 01:06:31,706
If someone doesn't go in there
and close that door,

875
01:06:31,815 --> 01:06:34,306
we're all going to die, period.

876
01:06:46,563 --> 01:06:49,794
Franklin is still working at
the airlock controls locally,

877
01:06:49,933 --> 01:06:51,924
but it doesn't look good, sir.

878
01:06:52,068 --> 01:06:54,866
Camile's explaining the situation
to everyone onboard.

879
01:06:54,971 --> 01:06:57,940
- I'll do it.
- Sir?

880
01:06:58,074 --> 01:07:01,566
This isn't the kind of thing I can ask
somebody else to volunteer for.

881
01:07:01,678 --> 01:07:04,306
If we're going to make it past this,
we're going to need you, sir.

882
01:07:04,448 --> 01:07:07,417
I don't know about that. You're doing
a pretty good job without me, Lieutenant.

883
01:07:07,517 --> 01:07:09,075
Yeah? Well, look at the mess we're in.

884
01:07:09,186 --> 01:07:12,883
- If that's not proof that we need you, then...
- Look, I'm not sure anyone should do it.

885
01:07:12,989 --> 01:07:14,923
I don't want someone sacrificing
themselves for me.

886
01:07:15,025 --> 01:07:16,925
I say we figure this out together
while we still have time,

887
01:07:17,027 --> 01:07:19,461
- or we all die trying.
- I want you to both listen to me.

888
01:07:19,563 --> 01:07:21,895
It needs to be done, and I'm doing it.

889
01:07:24,134 --> 01:07:26,500
- Look, sir, you can barely stand.
- Help me.

890
01:07:26,636 --> 01:07:28,467
Look, the paralysis is temporary.

891
01:07:28,605 --> 01:07:30,266
- Help me.
- You know that now. You will recover.

892
01:07:30,373 --> 01:07:31,772
- Lieutenant, I need your help.
- No, sir.

893
01:07:31,875 --> 01:07:33,502
- I gave you an order.
- I know.

894
01:07:33,643 --> 01:07:35,406
You can have me court-martialed
when we get home,

895
01:07:35,512 --> 01:07:38,174
but I am not going to help you kill yourself.

896
01:07:41,818 --> 01:07:43,683
My father's not in his room.

897
01:07:44,554 --> 01:07:47,182
We'll find him. He does not leave this room.

898
01:07:48,325 --> 01:07:51,021
- SCOTT: He can't have gotten far.
- I told him what was going on.

899
01:07:51,161 --> 01:07:56,997
Greer, this is Scott, come in. Greer?
Greer, do you read?

900
01:07:57,667 --> 01:08:00,830
Senator Armstrong is missing.
He may be headed your way.

901
01:08:01,137 --> 01:08:02,195
He's here.

902
01:08:04,641 --> 01:08:05,869
He's got a gun.

903
01:08:08,512 --> 01:08:12,778
I don't want to shoot you.
I don't think you want to shoot me.

904
01:08:14,050 --> 01:08:17,042
- Get out of the way.
- FRANKLIN: Just give me a little more time.

905
01:08:17,187 --> 01:08:20,350
- Let me try and fix this.
- I don't have much.

906
01:08:35,372 --> 01:08:37,636
ELI: Guys, I'm not seeing any change.
Whatever you just tried,

907
01:08:37,741 --> 01:08:38,833
it's not working!

908
01:08:38,942 --> 01:08:41,137
The problem's obviously mechanical.

909
01:08:45,782 --> 01:08:47,010
You can't fix it.

910
01:08:52,255 --> 01:08:53,722
Tell me what to do.

911
01:09:02,432 --> 01:09:03,626
Dad! No, wait!

912
01:09:14,978 --> 01:09:19,244
Dad, no! No! No! No!

913
01:09:22,419 --> 01:09:23,716
Open the door!

914
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:26,386
- Open the door, please!
- I can't!

915
01:09:26,489 --> 01:09:28,047
Please open the door!

916
01:09:30,327 --> 01:09:33,728
- He was dead on his feet.
- Dad, no!

917
01:09:34,664 --> 01:09:35,892
I love you.

918
01:09:37,434 --> 01:09:40,062
Please open the door. No!

919
01:09:42,105 --> 01:09:43,800
Eli! Not him!

920
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:46,272
There's nothing I can do for him here.

921
01:09:47,143 --> 01:09:49,668
Help him! Open the door, please!

922
01:10:01,924 --> 01:10:05,860
Please! No. No! No!

923
01:10:05,995 --> 01:10:07,986
No! No!

924
01:10:10,533 --> 01:10:11,795
No!

925
01:10:15,038 --> 01:10:16,027
No!

926
01:10:22,011 --> 01:10:24,241
He can't leave me.

927
01:10:37,593 --> 01:10:40,756
Chloe. Chloe!

928
01:10:43,132 --> 01:10:43,655
Well, at least he bought us a day.

929
01:10:57,228 --> 01:11:01,927
You! You did this! You killed him!
You've killed all of us!

930
01:11:02,167 --> 01:11:05,728
- Chloe, stop! Little help here.
- Hey, hey, relax.

931
01:11:06,004 --> 01:11:09,303
- Hey, hey, Chloe.
- Just get away from me! All of you!

932
01:11:13,645 --> 01:11:16,113
Miss Armstrong. You're in shock.

933
01:11:16,748 --> 01:11:19,216
Believe me, I understand.

934
01:11:19,784 --> 01:11:22,446
Everyone deals with tragedy
in different ways.

935
01:11:23,321 --> 01:11:25,585
- You're looking for someone to blame.
- I'm not looking.

936
01:11:25,690 --> 01:11:26,782
Hey, hey.

937
01:11:28,459 --> 01:11:32,657
I'm sorry about your father. I truly am.

938
01:11:34,966 --> 01:11:38,663
He was a good man, and he certainly
wouldn't have been my choice,

939
01:11:39,103 --> 01:11:43,267
but you must realize,
none of this was my fault.

940
01:11:44,709 --> 01:11:47,610
I didn't create the situation
that forced us here.

941
01:11:48,947 --> 01:11:50,608
There was no other way.

942
01:12:11,336 --> 01:12:16,831
Miss Armstrong, I know
you don't want to hear this just now,

943
01:12:16,975 --> 01:12:20,502
but this ship...

944
01:12:22,814 --> 01:12:26,978
This ship could be the most important
discovery mankind has made

945
01:12:27,085 --> 01:12:28,814
since the stargate itself.

946
01:12:29,988 --> 01:12:34,687
You know, the Icarus Project was
something your father truly believed in.

947
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:38,961
Enough to risk his career to support.

948
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:41,657
What difference does it make if we all die?

949
01:12:44,402 --> 01:12:47,894
A number of people died
during the attack on the base.

950
01:12:49,107 --> 01:12:50,631
Some of them I knew very well.

951
01:12:52,210 --> 01:12:54,701
I'm sure some had more value than others.

952
01:12:56,247 --> 01:13:00,149
As human beings,
all of them were invaluable.

953
01:13:03,955 --> 01:13:09,655
Look, my point is, I promise you,

954
01:13:09,761 --> 01:13:15,097
I will do everything I can to make sure
no one gave their life in vain.

955
01:13:16,701 --> 01:13:17,725
No one.

956
01:13:25,243 --> 01:13:26,904
Please give me a chance.

957
01:13:53,905 --> 01:13:54,894
Colonel.

958
01:13:57,141 --> 01:14:00,577
- We've lost Senator Armstrong.
- Oh, my God.

959
01:14:00,678 --> 01:14:03,476
- He's bought us some time.
- To do what?

960
01:14:03,614 --> 01:14:07,914
We're working on it. First up
is trying to dial the gate back home.

961
01:14:08,186 --> 01:14:10,450
- Should you even be on your feet?
- No.

962
01:14:10,588 --> 01:14:13,580
Well, I am on my feet,
and right now we're trying to get home.

963
01:14:13,691 --> 01:14:16,091
Camile, I need your help.
You know these people.

964
01:14:16,194 --> 01:14:21,097
I need you to spread the word.
Try to keep things as positive as you can.

965
01:14:21,766 --> 01:14:23,791
- I can do that.
- Good.

966
01:14:42,854 --> 01:14:44,822
CHLOE: I can't believe my dad is gone.

967
01:14:46,491 --> 01:14:51,929
I watched him die,
and I still just can't accept it.

968
01:14:58,736 --> 01:15:02,797
- Tell me about him.
- Why?

969
01:15:03,408 --> 01:15:05,535
Man died so I could live.

970
01:15:06,544 --> 01:15:09,308
I'd like to know a little more about him.

971
01:15:12,583 --> 01:15:18,385
No matter how tired he was,
or how long he'd worked,

972
01:15:19,424 --> 01:15:25,795
or what was going on in his life,
he always had time to listen to me.

973
01:15:28,666 --> 01:15:30,293
I'd go on and on.

974
01:15:32,236 --> 01:15:33,669
He never preached.

975
01:15:36,507 --> 01:15:40,375
He never told me what to do,
even though sometimes I wished he would.

976
01:15:43,247 --> 01:15:45,078
He would just listen.

977
01:15:47,452 --> 01:15:50,012
And then he would tell me
that he loved me.

978
01:15:53,458 --> 01:15:58,225
The best part was if I'd had a fight
with my mom, he never took sides.

979
01:15:58,763 --> 01:15:59,855
Hmm.

980
01:16:00,798 --> 01:16:04,495
Oh, God. My mom.

981
01:16:07,038 --> 01:16:08,903
He was her whole life.

982
01:16:11,709 --> 01:16:14,507
She probably thinks we're both dead.

983
01:16:14,612 --> 01:16:18,048
All I know is that he wanted you to go on.

984
01:16:20,451 --> 01:16:21,850
I know.

985
01:16:25,756 --> 01:16:31,058
I got to get back to the search.
You going to be okay?

986
01:16:32,163 --> 01:16:33,892
I don't know.

987
01:16:36,334 --> 01:16:37,892
Fair enough.

988
01:16:56,687 --> 01:16:59,212
- RUSH: Eli?
- What?

989
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:01,757
What are you doing?

990
01:17:04,829 --> 01:17:08,162
I just watched a man die.

991
01:17:10,368 --> 01:17:11,665
Okay?

992
01:17:17,608 --> 01:17:19,337
Don't you even care?

993
01:17:23,481 --> 01:17:30,182
Of course I do, and I'm also trying to learn
as much as I can, as quickly as I can.

994
01:17:31,055 --> 01:17:34,491
That is, in addition to running
nine separate searches

995
01:17:34,625 --> 01:17:38,493
in the database in the hope
of solving our life-support issues.

996
01:17:45,469 --> 01:17:46,959
Right.

997
01:17:49,807 --> 01:17:51,604
Found anything?

998
01:17:54,145 --> 01:17:55,442
Destiny.

999
01:17:58,749 --> 01:18:00,216
As in ours?

1000
01:18:00,851 --> 01:18:04,514
The name of the ship.
Translated from Ancient.

1001
01:18:06,691 --> 01:18:09,387
I've also discovered
that they were never here.

1002
01:18:10,928 --> 01:18:13,158
I thought this was an Ancient ship.

1003
01:18:13,264 --> 01:18:17,701
It is, but they sent it out unmanned,

1004
01:18:17,835 --> 01:18:19,962
planning to use the gate to get here

1005
01:18:20,071 --> 01:18:22,835
when it was far enough
out into the universe,

1006
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:26,501
but they probably learned to Ascend
before that time.

1007
01:18:27,678 --> 01:18:29,009
Learned to what?

1008
01:18:30,047 --> 01:18:31,309
Ascension.

1009
01:18:32,850 --> 01:18:36,809
It's a process whereby
consciousness converts to energy

1010
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:39,754
that no longer requires physical form.

1011
01:18:40,424 --> 01:18:42,153
That wasn't in the video.

1012
01:18:43,227 --> 01:18:45,354
Well, there's more than one video.

1013
01:18:47,932 --> 01:18:49,729
We should get back to work.

1014
01:18:54,238 --> 01:18:55,227
Sorry.

1015
01:19:08,168 --> 01:19:09,226
Sir, I think I got it.

1016
01:19:10,104 --> 01:19:13,096
It wasn't even that hard to find.
It's right here in the dialing program.

1017
01:19:13,207 --> 01:19:16,142
- You're sure?
- Yes, it's an eight-symbol address.

1018
01:19:16,243 --> 01:19:18,302
You mean you can dial this thing
back to Earth?

1019
01:19:18,445 --> 01:19:19,571
There's no point of origin indicated,

1020
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:21,773
but still,
there's only 36 symbols on this gate.

1021
01:19:21,882 --> 01:19:24,976
I'm assuming the ninth symbol represents
some X-factor distance equation.

1022
01:19:25,119 --> 01:19:27,349
Well, I don't care. Start dialing.

1023
01:19:27,488 --> 01:19:29,581
Sir, don't we want to
bring Dr. Rush in on this?

1024
01:19:29,690 --> 01:19:31,817
YOUNG: Well, you said
this wasn't that hard to find?

1025
01:19:31,959 --> 01:19:34,519
- No.
- Well, then he probably already knows

1026
01:19:34,662 --> 01:19:35,924
and didn't tell us.

1027
01:19:38,999 --> 01:19:40,523
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- What?

1028
01:19:40,634 --> 01:19:42,124
Someone's dialing the gate.

1029
01:19:56,983 --> 01:20:00,976
- Colonel Young. You're up.
- Nice to see you, too, Rush.

1030
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:02,883
I did order you to report to me.

1031
01:20:02,989 --> 01:20:04,718
Yes, but what are you doing?

1032
01:20:04,824 --> 01:20:06,416
We're trying to dial Earth.

1033
01:20:06,526 --> 01:20:07,754
RUSH: That would be a mistake.

1034
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:09,657
YOUNG: Riley thinks he's found
the address for home.

1035
01:20:09,796 --> 01:20:12,287
RUSH: His understanding of Ancient
is marginal at best.

1036
01:20:12,432 --> 01:20:15,333
RILEY: With respect, Doctor, I know enough
to recognize a reference to Earth.

1037
01:20:15,468 --> 01:20:17,902
He says the address wasn't
that hard to find, Rush.

1038
01:20:18,004 --> 01:20:20,131
No, no. This is a complete
waste of power we may need.

1039
01:20:20,273 --> 01:20:23,003
We have the address back.
All we need is the right point of origin.

1040
01:20:23,142 --> 01:20:24,575
And we've got 36 tries.

1041
01:20:24,677 --> 01:20:27,475
We barely have enough power
to operate the main systems.

1042
01:20:27,814 --> 01:20:30,908
This ship simply doesn't have
the capability to dial Earth.

1043
01:20:31,017 --> 01:20:32,985
You see, that's news to me.

1044
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:35,485
- He didn't tell me that, either.
- Well, I've only just learned myself,

1045
01:20:35,622 --> 01:20:37,988
- and you know what I've been doing.
- Even if it doesn't work,

1046
01:20:38,124 --> 01:20:41,025
the people aboard this ship
need to see us at least try.

1047
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:42,957
So, what, you're going to drain
what little power we have

1048
01:20:43,062 --> 01:20:44,256
for the sake of morale?

1049
01:20:44,364 --> 01:20:45,592
How ridiculous.

1050
01:20:50,903 --> 01:20:52,029
What was that?

1051
01:20:55,875 --> 01:20:57,843
YOUNG: Anyone near the observation deck?

1052
01:21:05,985 --> 01:21:08,977
Colonel, it looks like
we've dropped out of FTL.

1053
01:21:09,355 --> 01:21:12,381
- RILEY: Because we were draining power?
- No, no.

1054
01:21:13,526 --> 01:21:17,462
If I'm right, the gate should
begin to dial any moment.

1055
01:21:24,871 --> 01:21:27,066
How did you know that?

1056
01:21:27,206 --> 01:21:32,405
The ship detected a stargate on a planet
within range that may have what we need.

1057
01:21:32,545 --> 01:21:36,242
What? How the hell
are there even stargates out here?

1058
01:21:37,383 --> 01:21:41,649
The Ancients sent out a number
of unmanned ships ahead of this one.

1059
01:21:41,921 --> 01:21:45,220
They're programed
to gather data, resources,

1060
01:21:45,358 --> 01:21:48,885
to manufacture stargates
and deposit them in habitable worlds.

1061
01:21:49,028 --> 01:21:52,520
Any relevant information
is relayed back here to help plot the course.

1062
01:21:53,266 --> 01:21:55,666
You're telling me
that this ship knows we're in trouble?

1063
01:21:55,768 --> 01:21:57,668
Yes, because I told it we were.

1064
01:21:58,271 --> 01:22:01,434
Essentially, we're flying on autopilot.

1065
01:22:01,574 --> 01:22:03,940
This ship may have stopped
when it was within range of a stargate

1066
01:22:04,077 --> 01:22:05,408
regardless of our need.

1067
01:22:06,145 --> 01:22:07,373
But I have reason to believe...

1068
01:22:13,152 --> 01:22:16,246
YOUNG: So, what we need is
on the other side of that wormhole?

1069
01:22:16,622 --> 01:22:19,113
An educated guess, yes.

1070
01:22:20,727 --> 01:22:22,558
There's only one way to find out.

1071
01:22:22,662 --> 01:22:25,358
RILEY: Sir, you can't do that.
We have no idea what's on the other side.

1072
01:22:25,465 --> 01:22:27,933
We can use the Kino to find out.

1073
01:22:28,067 --> 01:22:30,433
I expect that's the purpose of this device.

1074
01:22:38,111 --> 01:22:40,443
- I'm getting readings over here.
- What have we got?

1075
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:44,072
Temperature, gravity,
atmosphere composition,

1076
01:22:44,183 --> 01:22:45,377
barometric pressure.

1077
01:22:45,485 --> 01:22:48,818
Oxygen, nitrogen, very little CO2,
extremely low humidity.

1078
01:22:48,955 --> 01:22:51,651
- Habitable, but just barely.
- Good enough.

1079
01:22:51,791 --> 01:22:54,624
BRODY: Looks like four other addresses
came up here, too.

1080
01:22:56,362 --> 01:22:58,387
They could be other planets within range.

1081
01:22:58,498 --> 01:23:00,159
Maybe we should think about
dialing them up and seeing...

1082
01:23:00,299 --> 01:23:01,891
No, no, no, they're locked out.

1083
01:23:02,001 --> 01:23:03,798
The ship chose this one.

1084
01:23:03,936 --> 01:23:06,803
The stargate is open,
all we have to do is step through.

1085
01:23:06,939 --> 01:23:09,305
What we have to do is put a team together.

1086
01:23:09,442 --> 01:23:10,909
Dr. Rush.

1087
01:23:12,845 --> 01:23:14,574
RUSH: Looks like our time might be limited.

1088
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:15,738
YOUNG: What is it?

1089
01:23:15,848 --> 01:23:18,783
It's a countdown. Just over 12 hours left.

1090
01:23:18,885 --> 01:23:20,284
What happens then?

1091
01:23:20,386 --> 01:23:23,116
I suspect we jump back into FTL.

1092
01:23:31,030 --> 01:23:34,124
Palmer is a geologist.
Obviously she should go.

1093
01:23:34,233 --> 01:23:36,701
Franklin and Brody are
the best of the rest of what we have.

1094
01:23:36,836 --> 01:23:38,463
Thanks for the ringing endorsement.

1095
01:23:38,571 --> 01:23:40,163
He didn't even mention me.

1096
01:23:40,306 --> 01:23:42,171
YOUNG: Franklin goes. The others stay.

1097
01:23:42,875 --> 01:23:45,708
We're still going to need good people
working on the problem from this end.

1098
01:23:45,845 --> 01:23:47,107
ELI: I'd like to go.

1099
01:23:49,148 --> 01:23:50,342
Really?

1100
01:23:51,017 --> 01:23:52,245
If I can help, then...

1101
01:23:52,385 --> 01:23:56,378
- Colonel Young, please.
- What? You don't think I can handle it?

1102
01:23:56,889 --> 01:23:58,049
He's going.

1103
01:23:58,191 --> 01:23:59,715
I've been off-world before.

1104
01:24:00,493 --> 01:24:03,189
You have made a habit out of
pulling our asses out of the fire.

1105
01:24:03,329 --> 01:24:05,820
Eli, you want to go, you're going.

1106
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:11,331
The only one I'm questioning right now
is you, Dr. Rush.

1107
01:24:12,905 --> 01:24:16,500
Well, besides Palmer, I'm the only one
who knows what we're looking for.

1108
01:24:16,843 --> 01:24:19,209
We have 12 hours to find what we need
and then get back on the ship.

1109
01:24:19,345 --> 01:24:20,369
You're sure you can't stop it?

1110
01:24:20,513 --> 01:24:21,741
No, we're just along for the ride for now.

1111
01:24:21,881 --> 01:24:24,042
Then we may all be better off on the planet.

1112
01:24:25,084 --> 01:24:26,984
Well, that's another reason
why I should go.

1113
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:30,712
Someone to assess whether
long-term survival there is even an option.

1114
01:24:31,691 --> 01:24:33,921
Right. Okay.

1115
01:24:35,194 --> 01:24:39,096
I want everyone clear
that Scott is in charge of this mission.

1116
01:24:39,232 --> 01:24:42,759
Let's gear up, let's find whatever
supplies we have, and move out.

1117
01:24:50,576 --> 01:24:54,603
- Sir, about Eli...
- He volunteered.

1118
01:24:54,747 --> 01:24:55,873
He's not trained for this.

1119
01:24:55,982 --> 01:24:57,347
Just like a lot of people we got on the ship.

1120
01:24:57,450 --> 01:24:59,680
I'm going to need to know
what they're made of.

1121
01:24:59,785 --> 01:25:00,843
He'll slow us down.

1122
01:25:00,953 --> 01:25:02,784
Well, if he does,
you send him back to the gate.

1123
01:25:02,922 --> 01:25:05,789
Listen, if we're going to make it,
and I'm not just talking the next few hours,

1124
01:25:05,925 --> 01:25:08,519
we're going to need
everyone on board to step up.

1125
01:25:11,564 --> 01:25:12,929
Lieutenant.

1126
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:15,597
Keep an eye on Rush.

1127
01:25:37,222 --> 01:25:38,280
We'll be back, sir.

1128
01:25:39,124 --> 25:41:31,000
Good luck.

1129
25:41:32,000 --> 25:41:42,000
