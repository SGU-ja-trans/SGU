we'II be touching on some of the things:

There are <i>39</i> symboIs representing
star consteIIations as seen from Earth:
これらは地球から見える星座を表した39のシンボルだ。

146
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,077
When a connection is made
between two stargates,
スターゲイト間がつながったとき

147
00:12:06,215 --> 00:12:09,378
an unstable energy vortex
emerges from the gate:::
不安定なエネルギーの渦がゲイトから出てくる。

that using an eighth symboI
そして、数十万光年先の別の銀河にダイアルできる

of power is required
