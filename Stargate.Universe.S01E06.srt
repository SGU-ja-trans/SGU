1
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:05,663
RUSH: Destiny.
The design is clearly Ancient.

2
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:08,233
Launched hundreds of thousands
of years ago.

3
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:09,535
SCOTT: Where the hell are we?

4
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:12,010
Several billion light years from home.

5
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:16,139
We are on a ship, but we have no idea
where we are in relation to Earth.

6
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:19,980
RUSH: This ship could be the most
important discovery mankind has made

7
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:21,246
since the stargate itself.

8
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,686
YOUNG: These are the wrong people
in the wrong place.

9
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,724
SCOTT: I've got a lot of wounded.
We need to get home.

10
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:28,419
RUSH: We barely have enough power
to operate the main systems.

11
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:31,926
This ship simply doesn't have
the capability to dial Earth.

12
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:40,567
Yeah, I read about these Chinese miners
that survived a cave-in for six days

13
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:42,368
by drinking their urine.

14
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,574
I'm gonna go ahead and pretend
I didn't hear that.

15
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:48,169
Yeah. You know what they ate? Coal.

16
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:51,876
- Coal?
- Yeah. This is a true story.

17
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:55,182
I mean, don't get me wrong,
it was pretty stupid. Almost killed them.

18
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:56,312
Water level's down again.

19
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:58,516
You're sure nobody went near
that compartment on your watch?

20
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,718
Spencer came by and asked
if he could have a look in the tank.

21
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:01,885
Why?

22
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:05,954
He's a crazy person. Sir. Anyway, I said no.

23
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,398
Nobody goes in there
without my authorization.

24
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:09,593
GREER: Sir.

25
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:14,837
Maybe it evaporated
when we went through the star.

26
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:16,033
RUSH: It's a closed system.

27
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:17,336
YOUNG: You know, all that water
went somewhere.

28
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:19,674
We're down to half of what we had
when we got here.

29
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:21,110
RUSH: I don't understand this.

30
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:23,375
You're the one trying to get
the recycling system up and running.

31
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,213
- Maybe there's a leak somewhere.
- Ship says it's fine.

32
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,220
- If what you're saying is accurate...
- It is.

33
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:31,483
- Then we've got a serious problem.
- Well, we wouldn't

34
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,024
if you did what I asked you to do
in the first place.

35
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:35,185
Oh, please, can we stick
to one problem at a time?

36
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:36,785
Running out of water wouldn't matter

37
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:39,490
- if we just dial Earth, go home...
- I already explained that to you.

38
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,533
The ship's recharged.
The power reserves are full.

39
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:44,296
- That's the point. They're not!
- Well, where are we at, then, Rush?

40
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:47,601
Probably about less than 40%
of original design capacity.

41
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:50,540
You think I can't tell when someone
just pulls a number out of his ass?

42
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:51,667
What?

43
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:56,112
I actually pulled that number
out of my ass. He's not making it up.

44
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:02,220
Look, if Destiny was ever capable
of dialing back to Earth,

45
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:03,584
it was thousands of years ago,

46
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,682
when the Ancients originally intended
to come here, but not now.

47
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,761
Well, then, you're right.
We have a problem.

48
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,159
- Yes.
- YOUNG: Again.

49
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:17,694
- Okay, Eli...
- Get Brody in on this. He's an engineer.

50
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:19,971
I need to borrow Eli.

51
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:29,181
- 40, 000 liters?
- FRANKLIN: That's what I heard.

52
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:31,443
But we didn't drink it.

53
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,509
Let's just say it wouldn't surprise me

54
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,145
if there was more water
than they're telling us.

55
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:39,248
- So, what, they're hoarding it?
- It's a big ship.

56
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:40,815
You know the military.

57
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,862
Long as they control the water supply,
they control us.

58
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:49,499
That's right. I'm talking about you.

59
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:53,638
Those two are harmless.

60
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,507
Keep it up. I need to know who I can trust.

61
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,972
- I feel like a spy.
- Eli.

62
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:07,012
- Clean this room up.
- Right.

63
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:56,259
- What is it?
- Nothing, sir. Just had a strange feeling.

64
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:59,736
- Well, we just dropped out of FTL.
- Wasn't that.

65
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:04,738
I'm on my way to the Gate Room.
There's a planet in range. Come on.

66
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:11,911
What have we got?

67
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:15,647
There's only one planet in range.
The ship's already dialed it up.

68
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,746
RUSH: We're getting readings now.

69
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:18,983
Whoa!

70
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,617
Looks like we entered the Hoth system.

71
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,024
Empire Strikes Back.

72
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:29,227
The second Star Wars movie.
Okay, I refuse to call it Episode V.

73
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:32,701
- Minus 47 degrees Celsius.
- Bundle up.

74
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,764
Is that water ice?

75
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:36,569
Yes, but the atmosphere
is dangerously thin.

76
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:41,978
And poisonous. 0.13% molecular oxygen,
95% carbon dioxide, with a hint of argon.

77
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,409
GREER: Ooh! Nasty planet.

78
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:46,109
RUSH: The only candidate within range.

79
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,210
We're gonna have to use
the spacesuits we found,

80
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:52,690
but if that brings back a half a ton of ice,
I'll take it. Shut it down for now.

81
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,161
Lieutenant Scott, come in, please.

82
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:00,990
Scott?

83
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,837
JAMES: There a reason your radio's off?

84
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:16,041
Come in.

85
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,047
Colonel Young is looking for you.

86
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:22,046
- I think I'd better...
- Go, go.

87
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:29,718
What, you couldn't find a broom closet?

88
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:47,110
We're still working on the other suits.
We're close to having a third one ready.

89
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:49,613
- How close?
- A day, maybe.

90
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,684
We'll be back in FTL by then.

91
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,945
Well, they're not in great shape.

92
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,317
All these years,
there's bound to be degradation.

93
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:59,357
Well, keep at it, we're gonna need them.

94
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,361
Looks like it's just you and me, then.

95
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:07,328
I could take Kennair, sir.

96
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:10,527
- She's done EVAs before, and you're...
- I'm fine.

97
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,571
How are we going to cut the ice?

98
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,934
Plasma cutter.
Should cut through the ice like butter.

99
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:23,174
Just don't get the business end
anywhere near you.

100
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,575
Suit radios are voice-activated
between you.

101
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:30,986
Press here if you want to tie into
the ship's communication systems.

102
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:34,889
T.J., you're in command while we're gone.

103
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:39,060
- Is everybody clear on that?
- Oh, I'm sure we'll manage.

104
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,896
Riley, start dialing.

105
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,867
Assuming a fair amount
of physical activity,

106
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,842
you have just over eight hours of air.

107
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:56,912
That's, what, 11 hours
until the next jump to FTL, right?

108
00:06:57,016 --> 00:07:00,577
Don't worry. You'll run out of air
long before we leave you behind.

109
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,076
Thanks.

110
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:30,976
Beautiful, huh?

111
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:34,185
One deep breath and you're dead.

112
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,880
Destiny, this is Young. Come in.

113
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,448
Yes, sir, we hear you five by five.

114
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:13,354
YOUNG: I've just tested the ice
by the stargate.

115
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:18,362
I read concentrations of ammonia
and several other toxic chemicals.

116
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,059
Now, how high are the readings?

117
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:23,362
Off the charts.

118
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,027
Well, you could try looking farther afield.

119
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,633
YOUNG: Maybe on the other side
of that lake.

120
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:33,268
SCOTT: Is that really a good idea, sir?

121
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,512
The further away from the gate we go,
the less ice we can bring back.

122
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:40,143
Oh! I've got just the thing.
Give me two minutes.

123
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,547
Colonel, give us five. Eli has an idea.

124
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,217
Maybe there's fresh water in the lake
under the ice.

125
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:52,286
At minus 47, the ice will be 10 feet deep.

126
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:55,900
We're better off finding a pressure ridge,
something we can mine.

127
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,833
Sounds like you've done
something like this before.

128
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,132
Oh, yeah. A million times.

129
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,240
- Did you feel that?
- It's just a tremor.

130
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,945
Hey, you know, the last planet
I was on exploded.

131
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,042
Destiny, this is Young.

132
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:16,053
We're burning through suit air.
What's going on with this bright idea?

133
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,126
GREER: Here we come, people!
Here we come!

134
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,390
Sorry, it's impossible to steer by remote.

135
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,630
That's fantastic, Eli.
What made you come up with that?

136
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:32,704
Actually, it represents
my most recent attempt to fly,

137
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:34,670
but it should carry a ton of ice.

138
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:38,403
PARK: Colonel, we're sending through
Eli's latest invention.

139
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:51,421
I love it!
The man gets a gold star.

140
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:53,690
SCOTT: How much will it hold?

141
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,590
Definitely more than
you can carry by yourself.

142
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:59,430
YOUNG: All right, we're heading out.
Keep the gate active.

143
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,131
We'll radio back when we find something.

144
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,164
- T.J.
- Sir?

145
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,767
- YOUNG: Listen, if we don't make it back...
- You will.

146
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,608
Well, we're two guys
in million-year-old spacesuits

147
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,475
walking around alone on an ice planet.

148
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,614
If we don't make it back,

149
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,383
you're gonna do fine.

150
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,049
Yes, sir. Good luck.

151
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,071
- The level's dropped.
- Again?

152
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:43,174
Nobody's been in or out.

153
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:44,742
Well, Brody said
there's no leak in the system,

154
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,277
so that leaves one alternative.

155
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,610
- Who could steal that much?
- That's a lot of water.

156
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:51,148
Yeah, I know,
but I don't know what else to do.

157
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,084
Besides, it wouldn't hurt to know
where we stand. Start a search.

158
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:56,881
Let's go, Gorman.

159
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:08,999
Dial it up again, Mr. Riley.
We must maintain communication.

160
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:13,729
It just went off a second ago.
Your timing is perfect!

161
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,369
Because it's been 38 minutes,

162
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:18,568
the maximum time
a stargate can remain open.

163
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,942
Well, see, I didn't know that.

164
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:31,619
Colonel Young, it's Dr. Rush.
What's your status?

165
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:36,525
We've found an exposed area of ice
that looks promising.

166
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:40,098
- Testing now.
- SCOTT: We're pretty far out.

167
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,493
- Can't see the gate anymore.
- It's still worthless.

168
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,435
RUSH: Keep looking.

169
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,009
GREER: Lieutenant Johansen.

170
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,511
- Go ahead.
- GREER: I found something.

171
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,648
- So did I. Can it wait?
- GREER: It's Spencer.

172
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,884
I can deal with him myself
if you'd like, but...

173
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:42,085
No, it's fine. I'll be on my way.

174
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:53,070
- I didn't steal anything!
- Yeah?

175
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,164
- What's this, huh?
- SPENCER: Those are mine!

176
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,834
I brought them through with me
when we evacuated!

177
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,672
You brought them through with you, huh?

178
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:04,907
- Give me a reason. Come on. Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey! Back off!

179
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:08,316
I don't have time for this.
Lock him up somewhere.

180
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,684
Colonel can deal with him
when he gets back.

181
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:21,791
You said you found something.

182
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,730
To be honest, I don't know what I saw.

183
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,470
I have to talk to Rush. You keep searching.

184
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:31,509
Nothing we find is gonna add up
to what's missing.

185
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,669
I know,
but we have to know what we've got.

186
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,475
No one's gone near the tank,
and it keeps going down.

187
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:21,220
Come on, come on.

188
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:28,598
Destiny, this is Young. We got pure ice.

189
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,827
That's excellent news.

190
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:31,835
It's a frozen waterfall.

191
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:36,637
We should be able to break it up
into manageable pieces and haul it back.

192
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,165
We'll be ready for you.

193
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:42,838
- Busy day on Destiny.
- I haven't taken anything.

194
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:46,809
- I don't think you have.
- What are you doing?

195
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:50,586
- Checking for stolen rations.
- It's okay, Dr. Franklin.

196
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:54,352
Confess, Miss Armstrong.
You drank 40, 000 liters of water.

197
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,025
- He's kidding.
- I know.

198
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,188
I'm just saying we have rights.

199
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:02,529
I'm done here, Miss Armstrong.
I hope I haven't inconvenienced you.

200
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:06,503
- I understand.
- I knew that you would.

201
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:11,140
You. Next.

202
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:30,017
This is never going to be enough.

203
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,128
Stand back.

204
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:37,332
SCOTT: You've done this before, too,
have you?

205
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:41,065
- YOUNG: At least five times.
- You mind if I give it a shot?

206
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:50,137
Remember, all we have are the bullets
we brought with us.

207
00:15:55,587 --> 00:16:00,354
So, are we talking about, like, one little
cloud of bugs or are they all over the ship?

208
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,257
I'm not even sure that "bugs"
is the right word for them.

209
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,023
Huh! What about "cloud"?

210
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:11,126
Except the cloud was alive. It was almost
like thousands of tiny alien creatures.

211
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,835
Yeah, I have a problem
with everything you just said.

212
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,499
What you've just described is...

213
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:21,306
Well, it's the same as Lieutenant Scott
claimed he saw on the desert planet.

214
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:24,280
That's what I was thinking, and maybe
some of them followed him back here.

215
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,644
Wouldn't we have
noticed them?

216
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:30,085
No, not if only a few came through
the gate. They're like tiny grains of sand.

217
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,054
And then what, started reproducing?

218
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,785
Well, if it's a living organism,
then, yeah, they would.

219
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,785
Okay, so now we've got aliens.

220
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,861
What if they start bursting out
of our stomachs?

221
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,068
I don't think they're dangerous. It almost
felt like they were trying to communicate.

222
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,261
Lieutenant Scott used the same word.

223
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:48,806
Yeah, at the time,
you said he was delirious.

224
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,431
Well, I was wrong.

225
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,173
What do you intend to do?

226
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,478
Well, I guess we should stop everyone
from wandering around the ship.

227
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,045
After you.

228
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,322
- Here?
- Yeah, yeah.

229
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:10,253
This is Lieutenant Johansen.
We have a situation.

230
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:15,161
It's under control, but as a precaution,
I ask everyone to return to their quarters

231
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,997
and remain there until further notice.
Thank you.

232
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:22,838
You're... You're not going to tell them?

233
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:27,401
- That we've got aliens?
- No, we'll keep it on a need-to-know basis.

234
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,373
- What else?
- You're in charge.

235
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:33,577
And I'm asking your advice. What else?

236
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:39,750
Always consider the greater good.
That's it.

237
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,792
That's enough ice for now.
Let's get out of here.

238
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:54,370
GREER: Gorman, meet me in
the Gate Room. We have ice on the way.

239
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:55,497
Copy.

240
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:56,626
MAN: They're on it.

241
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,511
Dial it back, please.

242
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,088
Destiny, this is Young.
How's it going up there?

243
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:28,394
- Offloading the sled now.
- YOUNG: Well, hurry it up.

244
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,933
We want to do one more run.

245
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:34,137
Just so you know,
another matter has come up.

246
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:37,208
- We have it under control.
- We have aliens on the ship.

247
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,709
- YOUNG: What?
- They just shredded Gorman.

248
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,005
What the hell does that mean?

249
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:46,551
Millions of tiny flying razor blades
floating around the ship like piranha.

250
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:47,983
Corporal Gorman is alive.

251
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:49,917
Lieutenant Johansen is tending
to him now.

252
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,853
- He's probably not going to make it.
- Eli!

253
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,083
YOUNG: That's it. We're coming back.

254
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,355
No, no, no, that's not necessary, Colonel.
Eli is overreacting.

255
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:59,759
We believe the creatures
are the same as those Lieutenant Scott

256
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,457
encountered on the desert planet.

257
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,125
They must have followed us back
through the gate.

258
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:07,433
SCOTT: No, I doubt those things I saw
were dangerous, sir. They helped me.

259
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,904
RUSH: Corporal Gorman
may have provoked them.

260
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,739
We'll know more once he comes to.

261
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,742
- If he comes to.
- In the meantime,

262
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:15,904
Lieutenant Johansen has ordered everyone
to remain in their quarters.

263
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,476
They're nothing more than a nuisance
at this point, Colonel,

264
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,844
but we desperately need more ice.

265
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:24,718
YOUNG: All right. We'll figure out what to
do with them when we get back.

266
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,187
Okay, sending the sled back through now.
Rush out.

267
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,031
MAN: Yeah, those are on the way.

268
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,926
I just sent it through, sir.

269
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,337
You're gonna have to learn
when to shut up.

270
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:44,409
You can't just...

271
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,442
You can't just lie to the guy
and expect me to...

272
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:51,141
Once back into FTL, it could be days
before we find another planet

273
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,650
capable of replenishing our water supplies.

274
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,949
This ice represents a fraction
of what we need to stay alive.

275
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:59,283
- We need more!
- Yeah, I know!

276
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,450
- But that doesn't mean that you can...
- Yes, it does!

277
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:06,190
- You're making it sound like we're...
- Just stop acting like a child, please!

278
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:12,235
RUSH: We have to figure this out.

279
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:17,703
I said "we."

280
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,654
I say we torch them.

281
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,693
You know, put some teams together,
hunt them down.

282
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,126
- Where'd you get that?
- I can invent things, too.

283
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,925
Hey, we've really got to work together
on this project...

284
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:42,125
You know, maybe the bugs were just
responding out of self-defense.

285
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:45,169
Self-defense? Did you see what they did
to Gorman's face?

286
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,535
Yeah, I'm the one treating him, Sergeant.
I saw exactly what they did to his face.

287
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,040
Look, we don't know what it is
we're dealing with,

288
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,601
and torching them may only serve
to antagonize them further.

289
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:58,114
- We hit them with something else.
- Revenge, that's great.

290
00:21:58,216 --> 00:21:59,478
We gotta do something.

291
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:03,452
If we just sit around till they drink
all of our water then we're gonna...

292
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,520
Alien bugs show up
and half our water disappears.

293
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,184
Don't tell me I'm the only one
who made this connection.

294
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:11,888
Well, obviously not. The question is,
what are we going to do about it?

295
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:16,058
Okay, Sergeant, you and your team
go search for this alien, entity, cloud,

296
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,295
bugs, whatever it is we're calling them,
and report back, okay?

297
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:19,392
Yes, ma'am.

298
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,905
- And, Sergeant, no torching.
- Yes, ma'am!

299
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,873
ELI: Ooh! I have an idea!

300
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:42,853
YOUNG: It's gonna be dark soon.

301
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:13,915
ELI: Okay, stand back.

302
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,123
RILEY: Nothing's happening.

303
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:21,663
Ooh!

304
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:26,768
- Yes, there is.
- It's like vapor. We just can't see them.

305
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,134
That's what they did
when I first saw them.

306
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,366
It's like they just disappear.

307
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:32,136
So they're growing
in numbers exponentially

308
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:35,611
and consuming our resources
without us even knowing it.

309
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,945
You have to get them off the ship.

310
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:48,788
JOHANSEN: Sergeant Greer,
come in.

311
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,592
I'm a little busy right now.

312
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:54,659
The bugs are getting into the water tank
every time we open the hatch.

313
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,757
Once we locate the main swarm,
we're going to have to find...

314
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:59,701
They're in front of me right now.

315
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:04,164
- Don't antagonize them.
- I won't.

316
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,171
Unless they antagonize me first.

317
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,480
Do they move when you do?

318
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,855
They do now.

319
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:28,929
What we need is an airlock.

320
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:32,629
Unfortunately, there are none
in the habitable compartments of the ship.

321
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:36,640
I know what to do.

322
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:39,835
YOUNG: This isn't going to keep us
going very long.

323
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,715
SCOTT: Maybe Destiny will figure out
we're getting short on water

324
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:49,913
and find us a planet with nice fresh water
right next to the stargate.

325
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,949
I mean, come on, we deserve a break.

326
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,858
Scott! Scott!

327
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:03,457
Can you hear me?

328
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:08,369
Yeah. Sorry, sir, the ice just gave way.

329
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,941
Are you hurt?

330
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:17,004
Negative. I'm okay,
but I'm wedged in pretty good.

331
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:20,310
Good thing, too.
Looks like a long way down.

332
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:24,354
All right, just hold on. I'm gonna...
I'm gonna throw a line down.

333
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,390
Here it comes.

334
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:38,267
I need you to tell me when you've got it.

335
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:47,575
Got it.

336
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:52,312
YOUNG: Now, if you can manage it,
run it under both your arms

337
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:54,783
and fasten it across your chest.

338
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,813
- SCOTT: Done this before, too, have you?
- Oh, yeah. At least a dozen times.

339
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:04,694
- Okay.
- Now, I want you to pull yourself up.

340
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:07,390
I'm gonna pull from this end. You ready?

341
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:13,330
- Yeah.
- YOUNG: Okay, one, two, three!

342
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:19,800
Pull! Pull, Scott! Come on!

343
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:22,769
Pull! Pull!

344
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:34,521
- How stuck are you?
- Pretty dang stuck.

345
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:38,755
- Is there any way you can dig yourself out?
- I'm not sure.

346
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:52,336
That's okay. That's passed. Scott?

347
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,681
Still here, sir.

348
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:02,412
All right, let's just...
Let's think about this for a second.

349
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,956
- Destiny, this is Young.
- Go ahead.

350
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,121
YOUNG: We've got a situation here.

351
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:13,493
There was a tremor, and Scott fell
through the snow into a crevasse.

352
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:16,332
He's fine, but he's just out of reach.

353
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:17,594
I tried to pull him up,

354
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:20,865
but that's not gonna happen anytime soon.
How's that other spacesuit coming?

355
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,341
We stopped work on that.
I confined everyone to quarters.

356
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:27,968
YOUNG: All right, it was just a thought.

357
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,741
Well, we'll figure it out.
How's your bug situation?

358
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:39,386
Same as before. Don't worry about it.

359
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:43,120
And don't you worry either, T.J.
I'll be out of here in no time.

360
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,766
Good luck. Johansen out.

361
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,867
Everyone is lying.

362
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:56,567
Yeah, grown-ups do that sometimes.

363
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:13,481
This is Greer. It's working.

364
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:15,923
They're moving away from us
as we move forward.

365
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,722
Good job. Keep it up.

366
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:27,704
SCOTT: How about you lower the gun
down, and I shoot myself free?

367
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:28,863
YOUNG: Yeah, that's good thinking.

368
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:31,373
There's no way the bullets will
ricochet into your ass.

369
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,410
SCOTT: Well, maybe I can cut my way out
with the plasma cutter.

370
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:35,775
You get one hole in that suit, you're dead.

371
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,212
Maybe there's a way for me
to get down there.

372
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:40,216
No, that's just as stupid.

373
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:42,548
"That's just as stupid, sir."

374
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:46,648
The last thing we need is for both of us
to be stuck down here.

375
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,161
All right. Break off.

376
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,927
You okay?

377
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:59,799
Closed in a little tighter, but I think...

378
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,969
What? What?

379
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:07,469
I think I'm losing suit pressure.

380
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,786
I thought we were supposed to be
confined to quarters.

381
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:27,023
Yeah, well, I heard over the radio...

382
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:32,662
There was a tremor.
Lieutenant Scott fell into a crevasse.

383
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:35,303
- Oh, my God.
- He's okay.

384
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:38,239
Just stuck.

385
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:39,667
Do they have enough air?

386
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,076
Colonel Young says
he's got it under control.

387
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:47,851
I just thought you would want to know.

388
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:55,724
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

389
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:07,335
YOUNG: I think the ice tore
a hole in his suit.

390
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,273
ELI: How big a tear is it?

391
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:13,572
I can't see it, but I can hear it.
It's hissing out pretty good.

392
00:30:16,044 --> 00:30:19,138
- An hour at most.
- YOUNG: Plenty of time to make it back.

393
00:30:19,414 --> 00:30:21,314
Yeah, if I wasn't stuck!

394
00:30:21,416 --> 00:30:25,250
Colonel, you have to consider
the amount of time you have left now.

395
00:30:25,353 --> 00:30:27,514
YOUNG: I'm aware of the damn time, Rush.

396
00:30:27,622 --> 00:30:29,385
All I'm saying is if you delay much longer...

397
00:30:29,491 --> 00:30:31,516
YOUNG: Listen to me!
I know exactly what you're saying,

398
00:30:31,626 --> 00:30:33,389
and I'm not going anywhere
without Lieutenant Scott,

399
00:30:33,495 --> 00:30:34,519
and that's the way it's gonna be!

400
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,694
What is the matter with you?

401
00:30:40,135 --> 00:30:43,696
Miss Armstrong,
you should return to your quarters.

402
00:30:43,805 --> 00:30:45,796
No, you know where you can go?

403
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:52,878
Now, look, Colonel,
I understand your desire

404
00:30:52,981 --> 00:30:55,575
to rescue Lieutenant Scott, of course,

405
00:30:55,917 --> 00:30:58,613
and only you can decide
how much time you have left,

406
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,884
but, Lieutenant,
if Colonel Young remains there

407
00:31:03,658 --> 00:31:04,784
trying to free you,

408
00:31:05,393 --> 00:31:07,759
to pull you up by himself,

409
00:31:08,763 --> 00:31:11,630
there's a chance
he might not make it back.

410
00:31:13,635 --> 00:31:14,795
SCOTT: He's right.

411
00:31:16,237 --> 00:31:17,898
YOUNG: Just keep the gate active.

412
00:31:18,006 --> 00:31:19,997
We're gonna make it back in time
with your damn ice,

413
00:31:20,108 --> 00:31:21,370
which is all you really care about.

414
00:31:21,476 --> 00:31:23,706
- Colonel...
- Young out!

415
00:31:26,481 --> 00:31:27,948
Damn, he's a lot of work.

416
00:31:53,942 --> 00:31:56,274
This is Greer. I locked them up.

417
00:31:56,544 --> 00:31:58,705
Closing off the ventilation in that room.

418
00:32:01,149 --> 00:32:03,140
Okay, vents are closed.

419
00:32:03,618 --> 00:32:06,143
- Should be airtight.
- What are they doing now?

420
00:32:07,689 --> 00:32:09,554
GREER: Looking for a way out.

421
00:32:10,658 --> 00:32:12,319
Let's hope they don't find one.

422
00:32:26,174 --> 00:32:28,005
Come on!

423
00:32:35,617 --> 00:32:36,811
Come on!

424
00:32:47,462 --> 00:32:48,554
SCOTT: Sir.

425
00:32:51,399 --> 00:32:54,391
- Colonel?
- I'm thinking.

426
00:32:54,502 --> 00:32:55,469
Go.

427
00:32:57,572 --> 00:33:01,201
- It's okay. Come on, sir.
- No, it's not.

428
00:33:02,076 --> 00:33:04,169
We both know
you've done this before, too.

429
00:33:05,713 --> 00:33:07,203
Done what?

430
00:33:08,082 --> 00:33:09,276
Lost people.

431
00:33:11,986 --> 00:33:15,683
Too many times. I'm not...
I'm not doing it again.

432
00:33:16,324 --> 00:33:20,124
- I can't let you do it.
- You don't have a choice.

433
00:33:21,029 --> 00:33:24,396
Not that I'm counting,
but this is the third time

434
00:33:25,266 --> 00:33:28,633
in almost as many weeks
that you've been willing to kill yourself,

435
00:33:28,736 --> 00:33:31,569
and there's a pretty good chance,
at this point,

436
00:33:31,673 --> 00:33:34,540
I won't be around
to talk you out of it again.

437
00:33:36,678 --> 00:33:39,647
YOUNG: You know, you're a fine
young officer.

438
00:33:39,747 --> 00:33:42,113
You've got a heart as big as a house,

439
00:33:42,884 --> 00:33:45,011
but I'm not here because I want to die.

440
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:48,018
I'm here because
I haven't given up on saving your ass,

441
00:33:48,122 --> 00:33:50,590
so just shut up and think.

442
00:33:54,929 --> 00:33:56,988
GREER: They're getting pissed off.

443
00:34:00,101 --> 00:34:01,864
Really pissed off.

444
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,402
A few of them got out.

445
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:12,277
What? How?

446
00:34:13,581 --> 00:34:15,572
We need a plan, Lieutenant!

447
00:34:17,218 --> 00:34:19,118
I'm coming down there!

448
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:26,652
This is beautiful out here.

449
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:29,924
Scott.

450
00:34:33,968 --> 00:34:36,493
Lieutenant. Lieutenant?

451
00:34:40,808 --> 00:34:45,177
Scott. Scott! Scott!

452
00:35:52,413 --> 00:35:56,076
Scott! Scott! Wake up, Scott!

453
00:35:56,784 --> 00:36:00,413
Lieutenant! Wake up! Scott!

454
00:36:01,155 --> 00:36:04,249
I need you to wake up, Scott!
Scott, come on!

455
00:36:06,327 --> 00:36:07,487
Wake up!

456
00:36:10,398 --> 00:36:11,626
Come on!

457
00:36:12,467 --> 00:36:13,456
Come on!

458
00:36:17,805 --> 00:36:18,931
Lieutenant!

459
00:36:25,012 --> 00:36:27,913
Come on, I got you. That's it, pull!

460
00:36:28,616 --> 00:36:31,278
Pull, Lieutenant. Come on, Lieutenant.

461
00:36:31,886 --> 00:36:35,982
Lieutenant! Okay, that's it.
Okay, that's it, I got you.

462
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,853
I got you. Okay.

463
00:36:39,494 --> 00:36:40,791
Okay.

464
00:36:43,531 --> 00:36:44,998
All right.

465
00:36:48,636 --> 00:36:50,069
You're okay.

466
00:36:54,275 --> 00:36:58,371
Hey, hey, Scott, come on. Hang on, kid.

467
00:37:05,586 --> 00:37:08,248
- What's the plan?
- We open the door,

468
00:37:08,689 --> 00:37:11,089
they go for the water, we close the lid.

469
00:37:11,192 --> 00:37:13,422
- GREER: All right, who's gonna do that?
- I am.

470
00:37:13,528 --> 00:37:16,224
- No, no, no, I will.
- I'm not the one with the torch.

471
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:18,355
No, look, I am not gonna let you do that...

472
00:37:18,466 --> 00:37:20,195
I'm not the one who's killed any of them,
Sergeant. You are.

473
00:37:20,301 --> 00:37:22,030
I'll stand back, torch them if they get out.

474
00:37:22,136 --> 00:37:24,866
- No, I want you out of sight.
- What, you don't trust me?

475
00:37:26,274 --> 00:37:28,174
No, I don't.

476
00:37:36,684 --> 00:37:38,015
All right.

477
00:37:59,073 --> 00:38:01,132
Eli, I'm ready.

478
00:38:01,242 --> 00:38:04,507
Make us a clear path to the Gate Room.
Seal off everything else.

479
00:38:09,784 --> 00:38:10,876
You're good.

480
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:13,746
JOHANSEN: If this doesn't work,
lock this compartment off

481
00:38:13,855 --> 00:38:15,379
from the rest of the ship.

482
00:38:19,727 --> 00:38:21,217
Destiny, this is Young.

483
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:25,658
I'm on my way back with Scott. Come in.

484
00:38:30,137 --> 00:38:32,002
Okay, let them out.

485
00:38:47,788 --> 00:38:49,449
Okay, I got them!

486
00:38:51,826 --> 00:38:53,589
All right, dial the gate. We're on our way.

487
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,466
Destiny, I'm almost at the stargate
with Scott.

488
00:39:01,569 --> 00:39:04,265
Shut it down so I can dial in.

489
00:39:04,572 --> 00:39:07,370
Colonel, we're about to send
these alien bugs through to the planet.

490
00:39:07,475 --> 00:39:09,636
- We've no other choice.
- What?

491
00:39:10,912 --> 00:39:11,936
What?

492
00:39:12,246 --> 00:39:16,307
RUSH: We need you to step away from
the gate and remain as still as possible.

493
00:39:16,417 --> 00:39:18,078
They're coming through now.

494
00:40:26,721 --> 00:40:28,484
- All right, here we go.
- Let's go.

495
00:40:33,427 --> 00:40:34,860
Get his helmet off.

496
00:40:41,969 --> 00:40:43,459
- Pick that up.
- Yeah, I got him.

497
00:40:43,571 --> 00:40:45,198
Give her a hand.

498
00:40:47,475 --> 00:40:50,967
His pulse is thready, but he's breathing.
Let's get him out of here.

499
00:41:23,544 --> 00:41:26,445
Sergeant Spencer,
you step out of line again,

500
00:41:26,547 --> 00:41:28,515
I will deal with you personally.

501
00:41:30,151 --> 00:41:31,482
Understand?

502
00:41:33,054 --> 00:41:34,351
Yes, sir.

503
00:41:37,491 --> 00:41:39,220
I don't think he does.

504
00:41:43,831 --> 00:41:45,059
FRANKLIN: Colonel, I need to talk to you

505
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:46,190
about the behavior of one of your men.

506
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,267
PARK: No, that can wait.
We need to go over

507
00:41:47,368 --> 00:41:48,335
the new rationing amounts

508
00:41:48,436 --> 00:41:49,403
before the next...

509
00:41:49,503 --> 00:41:50,492
VOLKER: Colonel, I was scheduled to use

510
00:41:50,604 --> 00:41:51,593
the communication stones this morning...

511
00:41:51,706 --> 00:41:52,695
FRANKLIN: This is a matter of rights!

512
00:41:52,807 --> 00:41:53,933
PARK: Colonel!
VOLKER: Colonel!

513
00:41:54,041 --> 00:41:56,509
Just a second, I was scheduled to use
the communication stones...

514
00:41:57,545 --> 00:41:59,809
At approximately 0300 hours ship time,

515
00:41:59,914 --> 00:42:02,405
Corporal Gorman succumbed
to injuries sustained

516
00:42:02,516 --> 00:42:05,349
in an encounter with an alien entity.

517
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:08,653
Lieutenant Johansen did
everything that she could.

518
00:42:08,756 --> 00:42:12,192
I intend to hold appropriate services
tomorrow at 1600 hours.

519
00:42:13,661 --> 00:42:15,561
How do I turn it off?

520
