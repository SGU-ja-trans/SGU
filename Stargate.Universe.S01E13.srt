00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,112
RUSH: This is what Destiny intended from
the moment it entered the star system.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,275
YOUNG: We are going to survive.
We are going to make it home.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,795
I'm telling you,
this ship came here for a reason!

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,358
RUSH: Destiny is powered
by the stars themselves.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,430
WRAY: He and Young
are bumping heads, yes.

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,715
Not sure which camp is the better choice.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,598
YOUNG: We just pretend
nothing happened?

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,319
We need to be ready
for the next encounter.

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,277
For the sake of the crew.

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,679
For the sake of the crew.

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,910
Eli, do not let that man
take over a single system.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,069
He's doing it anyway.

13
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,152
We've sealed off Colonel Young
and most of the military personnel.

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,229
We've taken the ship.

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,276
You've got our attention.
What do you want?

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,397
All military personnel
to hand over their weapons immediately.

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,438
I'm just a little surprised
you're taking Rush's side.

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,397
Rush was an inconvenience,

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,948
so Colonel Young left him
on that planet to die.

20
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,837
ELI: He has a transmitter
implanted in his chest.

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,069
That's how they've been following us.

22
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,914
Even if we survive to the next jump,
they'll just track us again.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,150
WRAY: Obviously, we need to
find a way to work together.

24
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,389
YOUNG: Pretend it never happened?

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,232
You shouldn't have left him on the planet.

26
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,958
You think I don't know that?

27
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,313
Should you be out of bed?

28
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,269
There's too much work to be done.
We'd best get on with it.

29
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,109
"We"?

30
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,799
Ready.

31
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,634
All right, go ahead and re-pressurize.

32
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,312
PARK: Re-pressurizing.

33
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,638
BRODY ON RADIO: It's holding steady.

34
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,591
And we've got atmosphere.

35
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,353
RUSH: Very good.
Continue with the repairs,

36
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,237
beginning with navigation and propulsion.

37
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,113
BRODY: Roger that.

38
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,356
YOUNG: What the hell are you doing?

39
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,232
Repairing the damaged shuttle,
if that's all right.

40
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,754
- I mean, you just had surgery.
- I'm fine, thank you.

41
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,400
You look like you're ready to drop dead.

42
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,799
And that would be a bad thing?

43
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,111
Yes, Rush, that would be a bad thing.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,639
Listen to me, the civilians aboard this ship
didn't try to take over

45
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,109
because they thought
I was doing a bang-up job. I get that.

46
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,189
Well, good for you.

47
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,953
I also get that I have to make this work.

48
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,671
So, I've ordered my people
to make a special effort.

49
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,513
I would like to do the same, even with you.

50
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,836
Wow. That must have taken
quite the effort.

51
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,958
You have no idea.

52
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,156
Lieutenant Scott,
we just dropped out of FTL.

53
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,277
- Please have a team ready on standby.
- SCOTT: Yes, sir.

54
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,079
- But the gate isn't dialing.
- YOUNG: Why not?

55
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,437
- Because there's nothing there.
- What?

56
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,509
It appears we have dropped out of FTL
into empty space.

57
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,750
No planets, no stars, nothing.

58
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,794
SCOTT: You might want to re-check
that data.

59
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,351
The ships that are seeding the gates
ahead of Destiny,

60
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,274
I thought they send a record
of the star systems in our path.

61
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,554
They do.

62
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,514
That star is not supposed to be here.

63
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,035
SCOTT: Sit tight, guys. Gate's not dialing.

64
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,554
They think it might be
some kind of a glitch in the database.

65
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,598
And here I was worried
I'd have to cut short my delicious meal.

66
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,515
You okay? Look like you might be
coming down with something.

67
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,116
I'm fine. Just tired.

68
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,557
We call that cold. Yeah.

69
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,313
Yeah, it's going to take a little time.

70
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,838
And "a special effort on our part
towards a spirit of cooperation."

71
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,319
The Colonel's right about that.
We have to live with these people.

72
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,389
Doesn't mean I got to like it.

73
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,552
Yeah, you do.
At least, you have to look like you do.

74
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,358
Good luck with that.

75
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,673
All right, am I wrong?

76
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,990
Does she look like
she's coming down with something?

77
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,632
RUSH: It's a G-2 star.
Yellow dwarf, similar to our own sun.

78
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,159
Because Destiny didn't know it was here,

79
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,552
the star's gravity well disrupted
our propulsion systems,

80
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,318
causing us to drop out of FTL prematurely.

81
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,390
It's a glitch in the technology.

82
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,438
So, what happens now?

83
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,195
We've entered a parabolic course.
Once we're around the star,

84
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,670
we'll be far enough away
from its gravitational influence,

85
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,149
back into FTL, and on our way.

86
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,390
How long's that going to take?

87
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,158
A few weeks.
There is, however, a silver lining.

88
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,229
A planet?

89
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,790
RUSH: Only one in the solar system,
so far as I can see.

90
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,990
About the same size as Earth.

91
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,590
- Looks close.
- RUSH: It is.

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,274
Within shuttle range.

93
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,999
Atmosphere?

94
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,268
In a word? Perfect.

95
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,077
I've been over the database a dozen times.

96
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,275
No evidence of any glitch or anomaly.

97
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,029
ELI: Yeah, I couldn't find anything either.

98
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,954
It's like this star
just appeared out of nowhere.

99
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,716
Well, vigorous surface activity,
strong stellar winds, bipolar outflow.

100
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,075
It's brand-new, all right.
It's straight out of T Tauri phase.

101
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,119
Which would still make it like, what,
100 million years old?

102
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,792
It's 200 million.

103
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,191
And how far ahead of us
are those gate-seeding ships?

104
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,068
It doesn't make any sense.
The ships would have noticed it.

105
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,831
And dropped a shiny new stargate
on the planet.

106
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:03,596
That's the weirder thing about this.
I mean, if this star really is this young,

107
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,036
then that planet should still be
a ball of molten rock.

108
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,479
All right, we're through the upper
atmosphere. Everything looks good.

109
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,118
I'm going to set her down
on that land mass directly below us.

110
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,678
- No sign of any wildlife.
- CAINE: That we can see.

111
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,994
It's pure.

112
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,389
How you feeling?

113
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,837
Great. A little sunshine, fresh air, water.
Just what I needed.

114
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,558
GREER: Yo, check this out!

115
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,593
There's a whole grove of trees back there
loaded with these things.

116
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,955
JOHANSEN: Hmm.

117
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,434
It's like a kiwi.
We'll take it back and do an edibility test...

118
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,555
- I'll do one right now.
- Greer!

119
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,676
What the hell are you doing?

120
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,309
Oh.

121
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,351
- That's nice.
- We don't even know if it's poisonous.

122
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,589
We will.

123
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,196
SCOTT ON RADIO: We're getting
a ton of plant samples.

124
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,589
T.J. thinks there's all sorts
of medicinal possibilities.

125
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,159
Well, that's great, that's great.

126
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,438
We also found some fruit.
Greer went ahead and ate one.

127
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,395
So far he hasn't had any reactions to it.

128
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,469
How about water?

129
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,836
Tons of it. Pure, too.
Bring back as much of it as we can.

130
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,798
No alien creatures slithering around?

131
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,233
No, nothing.

132
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,359
It's weird, but it's daytime,
so who knows what comes out at night?

133
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,151
All right, load up the shuttle,
and head on back.

134
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,515
Do a fly-over of the area on your way.

135
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,352
Copy that. Scott out.

136
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,273
SCOTT: There you are.

137
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,838
JOHANSEN: This place.
It reminds me of home.

138
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,556
We used to go camping,
Olympic Peninsula.

139
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,509
My dad and I,
we'd go hiking for days at a time,

140
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,356
find these amazing vistas and canyons,

141
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,633
waterfalls.

142
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,913
Time to go, T.J.

143
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,312
Damn near perfect.

144
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,118
It doesn't make any sense,
the ship not knowing about this place.

145
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,077
Of all the planets to put a stargate on,

146
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,912
I would think that...

147
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,239
Looks like we weren't the first ones here.

148
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,837
SCOTT: It's massive.
2,000 feet high, at least.

149
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,753
We detected a faint EM field around it,
but nothing else.

150
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,549
Those markings,
like some kind of alien language.

151
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,918
Do you think it's the same ones
we keep running into?

152
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,150
Not with this level of technology.

153
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,435
- What, to build this thing?
- No.

154
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,078
To create a planet.

155
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,869
They actually built this planet?

156
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,711
The Genesis device.

157
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,437
The end of Wrath of Khan.

158
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,273
The reason why Destiny
had no knowledge of this star system

159
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,349
is that it was placed there

160
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,954
after the gate-seeding ships
had passed through.

161
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,077
Wait, you're telling me
they built the star, too?

162
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,396
That would make them the number-one
all-time advanced civilization.

163
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,913
RUSH: That would be an understatement.

164
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,991
Okay, so what do we do about this?

165
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,672
We send a team back down there.

166
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,988
What?

167
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,435
Look, our orbit has been refined.

168
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,308
It's going to be four weeks, two days,
seven hours before we jump back to FTL.

169
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,152
I'm proposing
we take advantage of the wait.

170
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,708
I thought you said
we were almost out of shuttle range.

171
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,794
We are,
but we're going to swing back into range

172
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,636
once we circle the star
and before we jump to FTL.

173
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,073
We send a team down now,

174
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,958
pick them back up in a month's time,
loaded with supplies.

175
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,555
We time it right on the return,
we could take two, maybe three trips.

176
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,835
What about the aliens?

177
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,593
We didn't see them.

178
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,875
Well, it doesn't mean
that they're not around.

179
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:02,238
Look, we have three hours left
before we're out of shuttle range.

180
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,878
If we're going to do this,
we have to do it quickly.

181
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,430
Okay, okay, just to say this out loud,

182
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,234
assuming that this star
and this planet were created

183
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,676
by the most incredibly
advanced aliens ever,

184
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,911
maybe they don't want
anyone messing around with it.

185
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,271
We need the food and medicine.

186
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,113
RUSH: I agree.
The gains outweigh the risks.

187
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,394
ELI: Do they?

188
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,472
We're 0-for-3 on close encounters
of the third kind.

189
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,677
What makes you think that
these guys are going to be any different?

190
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,115
I'm not sending anyone down there
without protection.

191
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,077
And we'll have the shuttle
in case we got to bug out.

192
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,195
Eli.

193
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,234
Everything we do out here is a risk.

194
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,468
- WRAY: T.J.?
- Hi.

195
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,790
I heard you found some plants
with possible analgesic properties?

196
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,590
Yes, high concentration of salicin.
Similar to aspirin. You got a headache?

197
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,989
Only since I've been on this ship.

198
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,837
Take these, steep them in hot water,
and drink it.

199
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,236
So, you're joining the team
going down to the planet?

200
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,155
Yeah, all types of medicinals.
I can't pass it up. How about you?

201
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,952
I don't know.
I mean, part of me wants to,

202
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,079
but what if Rush's calculations are off?
Can we trust him?

203
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,833
You tell me.

204
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,558
YOUNG: I want round-the-clock watch
on camps.

205
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,518
Guard details on every science team
going into the woods.

206
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,589
SCOTT: Yes, sir.

207
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,274
YOUNG: Hopefully we'll be able to fix
the damaged shuttle before you return,

208
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,113
and double up on supplies
we can bring back.

209
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,152
- Good luck.
- SCOTT: Thanks.

210
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,757
You're coming, too?

211
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,469
- Is there a problem with that?
- YOUNG: No. Happy camping.

212
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,713
- You all set?
- Yes, sir.

213
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,917
Cole will be looking after Franklin
in the infirmary while I'm away.

214
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,788
I told her to contact me
if there's any change in his condition.

215
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,674
- Is there anything else?
- No, sir.

216
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,673
SCOTT ON RADIO: We're clear.

217
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,951
YOUNG: We'll see you in a month.

218
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,999
All right, folks, you got the whole month
to enjoy the scenery.

219
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,197
We need to set up camp,
establish a perimeter.

220
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,068
Sun moves that way. Guys? Over here.

221
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,913
Sun moves that way, so that's west, okay?

222
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,549
River's back that way
about half a klick... Kilometer.

223
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,758
We'll sleep in the shuttle for now,
but I want shelters built ASAP.

224
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,718
How many of you guys
have gone camping before?

225
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,512
Well, okay, that's fine.
Just watch, ask, and learn.

226
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,797
You guys know your team assignments.
Let's get going.

227
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,914
MAN: Okay. Let's go.
WOMAN: Yeah, I got it.

228
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,795
Um...

229
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,599
I don't have a team yet.

230
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,229
Yeah, right, sorry.
Do you feel like helping T.J. with plants?

231
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,793
- Sure.
- Okay.

232
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,512
GREER: Hey, hey, hey, hey!
What's going on over here?

233
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,636
I'm not digging the latrine.

234
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,989
- Is that what you told him to do?
- Somebody's got to do it.

235
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,435
True enough. Start digging.

236
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,072
- What? No, you can't make me.
- You, too.

237
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,116
- But, Sergeant, I...
- You're going to dig, okay?

238
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,713
You're both going to dig,

239
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,313
and you're going to
love every moment of it,

240
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,960
or you will keep digging until you do.

241
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,310
The spirit of co-operation.

242
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,597
We're all friends now.

243
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,518
So, we'll photograph
and log every plant we find.

244
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,310
Don't ingest anything
until we do a proper edibility test.

245
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,917
- You all right?
- Yeah, just...

246
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,317
It's passing. I'm fine.

247
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,797
The amount of food and water
we get on that ship,

248
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,553
it's a wonder we're not all fainting
from malnutrition.

249
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,675
Yeah.

250
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,032
SCOTT: Well, I just got the word.

251
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,874
Destiny is now officially out of range.
No turning back.

252
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,912
We are stuck here.

253
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,589
- WRAY: Hey.
- Hey.

254
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,553
How's it going?

255
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,793
Well, I hope they bring back
tons of food.

256
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,714
The last of that fruit
that they brought back is already gone.

257
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,313
Or so you think.

258
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,792
Snuck this earlier.

259
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,395
I'll split it with you
if you promise not to rat me out.

260
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,549
Deal.

261
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,119
So, tell me... Thanks.

262
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,159
You think it's possible to create a star?

263
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,073
No. No way.

264
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,991
Now, being transported to a ship

265
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,833
on the other side of the universe
by a wormhole,

266
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,751
that's totally doable.

267
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,198
Look, that star just appeared
out of nowhere

268
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,874
and the planet's age doesn't match.

269
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,157
If some all-powerful alien beings
didn't create it,

270
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,114
who did?

271
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,598
Jeez, hey, I'm sorry.
I'll go somewhere else.

272
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,716
Oh, no. No, no, that's okay.

273
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,679
Hey, I wanted to thank you.

274
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,629
I know all the military personnel
are trying to mend fences,

275
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,188
but you're one of the few
who actually seems to mean it.

276
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,714
Yeah, well, we've got to work it out, right?

277
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,395
It's interesting that we've now been
given the time down here to do that.

278
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,631
Yeah, well, we were pretty lucky
to find this place.

279
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,757
My mom used to say
there's no such thing as luck,

280
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,153
only the hand of God giving you
a little help when you need it most.

281
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,234
Somewhere along the line, I mean,
I stopped believing all that.

282
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,108
But now, I look at this place...

283
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,073
I mean, put right in our path for us to find.

284
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,596
Tell me that isn't a miracle.

285
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,879
Hey, how's it going?

286
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,837
- Terrible.
- Great.

287
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,273
Which is it?

288
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,873
Propulsion's almost completely shot.

289
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,190
Might be able to get to the point
where we can fly down to the planet,

290
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,316
but there's no way it's going to have
enough power to get back up.

291
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,631
So, there's that. We're making
some progress on navigation.

292
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,314
We can turn left, but not right,
or up, or down.

293
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,472
Okay. Why did you say "great"?

294
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,472
We can turn left.

295
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,952
RUSH ON RADIO: Colonel Young.

296
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,518
- Go ahead.
- While Destiny's engines are off-line,

297
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,989
I'd like to use the extra power
to strengthen the shield,

298
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,278
maybe explore some damaged areas
in the ship, possibly make some repairs.

299
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,396
Reclaim some real estate.

300
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,429
Exactly.

301
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,915
You go ahead. I'll have Lieutenant James
put a team together.

302
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,513
You two, you keep at it.

303
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,558
You have a month to get this thing
to fly to and from that planet

304
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,949
and do more than make a left turn.

305
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,873
- Fate brought us here?
- I don't know, maybe.

306
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,397
Maybe that's what brought us to Icarus,
and then Destiny.

307
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,471
JOHANSEN: You don't believe that?

308
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,359
What, you miss your flight
and the plane crashes?

309
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,555
You weren't spared for a reason.

310
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,155
God doesn't have a master plan for you.
Things just happen.

311
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,313
So we're born, we live, we die?
It's all random?

312
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,110
Yeah, and along the way, you do the best
with whatever crap you happen to step in.

313
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,389
WRAY: I'm starting to get a bad feeling.

314
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,274
ELI: Me, too.

315
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,389
I'm afraid we made a mistake
sending those people down to that planet.

316
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,269
No.

317
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,794
The mistake was not going with them.

318
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,518
I have been searching
all of my days

319
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,396
All of my days

320
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,758
Many a road, you know

321
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,400
I've been walking on

322
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,189
All of my days

323
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,479
And I've been trying to find

324
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,434
What's been in my mind

325
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,395
As the days keep turning into night

326
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,234
Well, I have been quietly standing
in the shade

327
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,915
All of my days

328
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,679
Watch the sky breaking on the promise
that we made

329
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,788
All of this rain

330
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,908
And I've been trying to find

331
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,028
What's been in my mind

332
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,830
As the days keep turning into night

333
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,872
Hey. You okay? Here...

334
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,998
I thought you were feeling better.

335
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,351
Yeah. I am.

336
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,032
Here, let me help you back to camp.
You should lie down.

337
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,874
No, Chloe. I'm not sick.

338
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,673
How far along?

339
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,071
About 15 weeks.
Right before we left Icarus.

340
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,998
But nobody knows,
and I'd like to keep it that way.

341
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,514
- Eventually, they're going to...
- I know.

342
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,513
I know, but not now.
I'll figure out when the right time is. Okay?

343
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,350
Yeah. Sure.

344
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,954
Back on the ship, I wasn't doing well,

345
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,195
getting anemic, but out here,
with all the food and water.

346
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,838
Actually, the morning sickness
is a good sign.

347
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,037
What about the father?

348
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,676
- What the hell is it?
- RUSH: I don't know yet.

349
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,478
JAMES: Looks like a robot.

350
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,199
Figure it out.

351
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,269
RUSH: Yeah, no problem.

352
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,873
Once I've attended
to the other 100 things on my list.

353
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,075
You can always put somebody else on it.

354
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,914
I'm not going to have anyone
touch this thing without me present.

355
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,230
I'm going to get to it, Colonel.

356
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,070
- Close it up.
- JAMES: Okay.

357
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,555
SCOTT: Hey.

358
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,110
- You okay?
- Yeah.

359
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,594
Homesick for Destiny?
Only a few more days till we head back.

360
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,834
Honestly?

361
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,593
No. I'm not.

362
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,158
I like it here.

363
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,112
I'm starting to wonder if Dr. Caine is right.

364
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,318
That it's no accident we found this planet.

365
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,632
- We were brought here by God?
- Or whoever. I don't know.

366
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:53,273
I mean, if some alien beings
are powerful enough to create this place,

367
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,396
maybe there is some kind of higher power
in the universe

368
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,393
that knew we were in trouble,
put this planet here for us to find.

369
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,278
Maybe it's time we stop thinking about...

370
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,558
Hey, what's that?

371
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,309
YOUNG: When?

372
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,630
SCOTT ON RADIO: Tonight, just now,
coming from the obelisk,

373
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,312
shooting straight up into the sky.

374
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,394
Dr. Volker detected
some kind of a strange radiation.

375
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,837
He's working on it, but it's like
this whole thing suddenly came to life.

376
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,274
Why now?
Why not when they first got there?

377
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:47,673
Perhaps their initial impact wasn't
enough to trigger an alert. But now...

378
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:52,073
So, this light, you think
it'll bring the aliens back to the planet?

379
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,355
YOUNG: You won't be there to find out.

380
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,955
SCOTT: Destiny is almost in range.

381
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,158
Colonel Young wants us
to start breaking up camp,

382
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,276
- get ready to head back.
- VOLKER: What about the obelisk?

383
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,397
- I still need time to figure...
- SCOTT: We don't have enough time.

384
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,710
We need to be ready to fly
as soon as Destiny is in range

385
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,916
so we can make a couple trips,

386
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,468
and get all that food back to the ship.

387
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,872
All right, people, you heard the man.
Move your asses! Let's go!

388
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,519
- Yes?
- Yes.

389
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,753
- Well...
- BRODY: No.

390
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,558
Again with this?

391
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,519
The shuttle can fly. It can now go both left
and right and up and down.

392
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,115
But like I said before,
too many problems with propulsion.

393
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,229
Fact is, we may never be able
to fully repair it.

394
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,715
JAMES: All kinds of citrus-type fruits,
beans, potatoes...

395
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,598
Sweet potatoes.
Scott says they're amazing.

396
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,635
They cannot get back here fast enough.

397
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,355
You seem concerned, Dr. Rush.

398
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,557
- Something we should know about?
- No.

399
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,677
No problems with your calculations, right?

400
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,671
The shuttle will return as scheduled?

401
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,309
Yeah, and Destiny will leave this system,

402
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,798
never knowing who created it or why.

403
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,512
You might want to give her some time.

404
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,068
Well, we're breaking camp,
and she just takes off without telling me?

405
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,436
She's thinking about staying here.
A lot of people are.

406
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,308
Come on, you can't be surprised.
You've heard people talking about it.

407
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,756
- They like it here.
- I like it here, too, but we cannot stay.

408
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,910
- It is out of the question.
- Why not?

409
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,150
If people want to stay, they have the right.

410
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,152
Where the hell have you been?
We've got to move.

411
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,639
I'm not going.

412
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,153
Okay, look, I understand
how you feel. I like it here, too.

413
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,276
But we cannot stay.
The Colonel gave us orders.

414
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,078
- Matt, don't.
- I can't go back there.

415
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,435
- SCOTT: Why not?
- It's safer here.

416
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:20,195
Safer? The aliens who built this rock
may be on their way back!

417
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,315
CAINE: Then good.

418
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,756
I mean, if they're advanced enough
to build a solar system,

419
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,831
I know they can help us get back home.

420
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,309
Not if they don't wipe us out first.

421
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,235
CHLOE: Why do you immediately think
they're going to harm us?

422
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,914
I'm sorry, do you not remember
what the last aliens did to you?

423
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,869
This planet was created for us.
We were led here for a reason.

424
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,030
For God's sake...

425
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,438
What if they don't come back? Then what?

426
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:51,150
I'm okay with that. I'm healthier here.
There's food and plenty of water.

427
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,117
And we're bringing a ton of it back!

428
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,316
And eventually, it'll run out.

429
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,432
Okay, what about the winters?

430
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,308
Dr. Volker, you said you found evidence
it gets very cold here.

431
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,278
Yes, well below freezing. For months, T.J.

432
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,793
So, we'll build better shelters.

433
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,757
CAINE: I don't even think
it will come to that.

434
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,513
The beings who created this world
will return,

435
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,034
and they will help us get back home.
I know it.

436
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,873
You would rather take your chances
out here than on Destiny?

437
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,313
CHLOE: We don't know
where that ship is going,

438
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,719
or if we'll ever even make it home.

439
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,438
There's a stargate on it.

440
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,033
As long as we have the potential
to connect...

441
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,235
JOHANSEN: Matt.

442
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,599
I'm pregnant.

443
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,437
I can't go back there.

444
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,670
I can't stand the thought
of raising a child on that ship.

445
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,352
We are in range.
You are clear to make the first trip back.

446
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,795
We only have the one shuttle,
so time is of the essence.

447
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,915
SCOTT: Sir,

448
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,799
we have a problem down here.

449
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,199
What is it?

450
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,873
Some of the people have decided

451
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,190
that they would like to
stay behind on the planet.

452
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,590
- Well, you tell them no.
- I tried, sir.

453
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,796
They have pretty much
made up their minds.

454
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,279
Who are they?

455
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,116
Eleven people total.

456
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,193
Dr. Caine, Chloe,

457
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,156
- Lieutenant Johansen...
- What?

458
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,993
- No! Scott, you tell them...
- And me.

459
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,633
- Eleven?
- YOUNG: Including some of my own people.

460
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:33,110
And Scott, he has the nerve to ask me
to fly him back down to the planet

461
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,077
after he drops off
the ones returning to the ship.

462
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,913
Well, look, I can understand
some of them wanting to stay,

463
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,036
but Lieutenant Scott and T.J.?

464
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,477
Yeah, he says he feels an obligation
to help the people survive down there.

465
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,278
WRAY: What are you going to do?
YOUNG: What am I going to do?

466
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,509
I'm going to make sure
they don't stay down there,

467
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,589
that's for damn sure.

468
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,433
WRAY: No, no, you cannot force them
to come back.

469
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,999
I think he can.

470
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,598
We're going to lose more people
through attrition aboard this ship.

471
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,194
We simply cannot afford to shed
that many people at one time.

472
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,475
So, what do you expect him to do?
Bring them back at gunpoint?

473
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,710
Well, if it comes to that, yes.

474
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,559
You allow Lieutenant Scott to return

475
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,676
with those who want to come back
to Destiny,

476
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,115
then send down a military detail
and round up the rest.

477
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,715
That's great, Rush, coming from you.
First you want to kick the military out,

478
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,917
and now you want us
rounding people up at gunpoint.

479
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,158
Colonel, those people have the right

480
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,152
to make their own decisions
about their future.

481
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,792
Not all of them.

482
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,834
Did you...

483
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,551
Did you tell him about me?

484
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,839
I'll let you do that. It's not my place.

485
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,791
He is the father, right?

486
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,555
I caught a few looks between you.

487
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,678
I don't think anyone else knew.
I haven't heard any rumors or anything.

488
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,915
Hey. Hey...

489
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,996
You are going to be okay.

490
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:19,159
I'll be here, and I'm not going to
let anything happen to you.

491
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,915
RUSH: Have you gone mad?

492
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,752
Man, look,
I really don't want to argue with you.

493
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,114
- RUSH: You're letting them stay?
- Not all of them.

494
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,952
- And you're giving them a shuttle?
- The damaged shuttle.

495
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,075
It's not damaged anymore!

496
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,151
Didn't you say that the shuttle
may never be fully functional?

497
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,593
We may need the shuttle
for any number of reasons...

498
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,511
I'm not going to leave those people
down there with nothing.

499
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,354
- You cannot let them stay, Colonel.
- I have made my decision.

500
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,273
Is it ready?

501
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,871
Yeah, but there's still some issues

502
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,076
as to whether it can hold up
through atmospheric entry.

503
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,754
Questions that are about to be answered.

504
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,518
Eli just radioed.
Colonel Young is on his way down here.

505
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,397
- Why?
- VOLKER: How?

506
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,710
We're entering upper atmosphere.

507
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,753
ON RADIO: So far, so good.

508
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,039
Come on, hold it together.

509
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,472
Yeah, right there!

510
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,719
Destiny, this is Young. I made it through.

511
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,829
Has anyone changed their minds
about returning to the ship?

512
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,349
No.

513
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,110
All right. Here's the deal.

514
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:29,152
I am leaving the damaged shuttle behind
for those who want to stay.

515
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:35,674
You can use it for shelter and power,
fly around in short hops on the surface.

516
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,548
You will not be able to leave
the atmosphere, so don't even try.

517
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:45,150
What it will do is give you guys
a fighting chance while you are down here,

518
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,878
especially with winter on the way.

519
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,350
- Thank you, Colonel. I know this isn't...
- I'm not finished.

520
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,512
I will leave it for you
only under one condition.

521
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,590
All military personnel
will return with me to Destiny.

522
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,949
- What?
- What?

523
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,716
Reject my proposal,
and we'll take you all back by force.

524
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,835
You can't do that.

525
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,070
That's not something
you want to test, Doctor.

526
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,833
SCOTT: Sir, some of these people
just don't feel safe on board.

527
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,559
None of us feels safe.
That doesn't mean we give up.

528
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,709
They're not giving up.

529
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,997
That ship is the best chance we have
of getting home.

530
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,593
CAINE: I disagree, sir.

531
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,633
I believe we were brought here
for a reason,

532
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,429
and that whoever created this planet
will provide for us.

533
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,478
They are our best chance
of getting back home.

534
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,835
Okay.

535
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,237
What's it going to be?

536
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,431
- GREER: Colonel.
- Sergeant.

537
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,472
You want to stay here out of obligation
to these people, to protect them?

538
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,628
I can respect that. But there are people
back on the ship who don't have a choice,

539
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,030
and you have an obligation to them
as well, Lieutenant.

540
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,878
T.J., they need you.

541
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,999
Welcome home.

542
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:43,916
Well, as predicted,
we've corrected our course

543
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,436
and jumped back into FTL.

544
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,269
I'm sorry you didn't get your wish.

545
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,593
And what wish was that?

546
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,275
Aliens advanced enough
that they could build a star system.

547
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,275
Finally somebody you could have
a decent conversation with.

548
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,839
I enjoy chess.

549
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,312
- Colonel, do you have a moment?
- Can it wait?

550
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,472
I wanted to better explain my reasons
for choosing to stay behind.

551
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,109
Look, I realize you're probably
not hungry, Lieutenant, but I am.

552
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,872
I hear they're serving up a feast
in the mess,

553
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,678
so why don't we talk about it later?

554
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,318
- Sir...
- Later.

555
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,110
What if we were meant to stay there?
All of us?

556
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,359
What if that planet was a lifeline,

557
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,677
and we just let it go?

558
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,474
I can't pretend to answer that, Matthew.
No one can.

559
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,750
Even breathing feels all right

560
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:16,072
Yes, even breathing feels all right

561
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,193
Now even breathing feels all right

562
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:27,599
Yes, even breathing

563
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,389
Feels all right

564
