1
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:08,874
<i>I may be on the verge of discovering
the true nature of Destiny's mission.</i>

2
00:00:10,013 --> 00:00:13,073
<i>You've had control of this ship
the whole time!</i>

3
00:00:13,183 --> 00:00:14,650
Why wouldn't you tell anyone?

4
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:17,687
The Lucian Alliance is planning
an attack on Earth.

5
00:00:18,221 --> 00:00:21,212
<i>I killed Riley.
I suffocated him with my own hands.</i>

6
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,223
You are a good commander.

7
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:26,226
<i>There is no mission other
than getting these people home.</i>

8
00:00:26,294 --> 00:00:29,491
<i>It was never about going home, it's
about getting us to where we're going.</i>

9
00:00:29,564 --> 00:00:31,998
That is the mission.

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,895
<i>Ginn and I figured out</i>

11
00:00:33,968 --> 00:00:37,426
<i>how to dial the ninth chevron back to Earth
while Destiny recharges in a star.</i>

12
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:38,995
Wait three seconds, then follow me!

13
00:00:39,074 --> 00:00:40,166
<i>The connection was made,</i>

14
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:42,072
but you were the only one
who made it through to Earth.

15
00:00:42,177 --> 00:00:44,168
You're Matthew Scott.
And you're Ronald Greer.

16
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:45,234
How do you know our names?

17
00:00:45,313 --> 00:00:46,371
<i>I don't even know
how this is possible.</i>

18
00:00:46,448 --> 00:00:50,406
<i>Their civilization was founded
2,000 years ago by the crew of the Destiny.</i>

19
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:51,508
What's Novus?

20
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:53,018
The planet where you
founded our civilization.

21
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:54,213
But then one day something happened,

22
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:55,448
and we couldn't connect
to Novus anymore.

23
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:56,817
Will you take us home?

24
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,321
<i>You see any
movement down there?</i>

25
00:00:58,392 --> 00:00:59,416
Negative.

26
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:02,359
<i>But millions of people lived here.
Where did they all go?</i>

27
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:09,961
Colonel?

28
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:13,999
T. J?

29
00:01:15,174 --> 00:01:16,232
No.

30
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:18,703
It's Chloe.

31
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,207
Where's... Where's Steven?

32
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,751
I'm right here, Dad.

33
00:01:31,156 --> 00:01:33,624
Sara's on her way.
She'll be here any minute.

34
00:01:38,696 --> 00:01:40,186
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:15,831 --> 00:02:17,025
Ash.

36
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,135
<i>We just did a recon
of the city center.</i>

37
00:02:24,205 --> 00:02:25,968
<i>Place is completely deserted.</i>

38
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,133
<i>Hard to breathe, too,
with all the ash falling.</i>

39
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:29,506
So much for dropping
them all off down there.

40
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,971
I don't want you hanging around
if it's too dangerous.

41
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,410
Yes, sir, but Yaozu took us to the entrance
to an underground complex.

42
00:02:36,484 --> 00:02:38,645
It's sort of like a giant fallout shelter.

43
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:40,277
Who knows, there could be people
holed up in there.

44
00:02:40,555 --> 00:02:41,817
<i>I think we should check it out.</i>

45
00:02:41,956 --> 00:02:44,550
<i>- Be careful. Planet's unstable.
- Copy that.</i>

46
00:02:44,692 --> 00:02:47,661
Got a problem, though. Doors are sealed.
Pretty thick, too.

47
00:02:47,929 --> 00:02:49,759
We tried to blast it open with C-4,

48
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:52,320
even used the shuttle's weapons,
but no luck.

49
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:54,866
<i>We can use Destiny's main weapon,
blow a hole in it.</i>

50
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:57,667
Yeah, and destroy the entire complex
in the process.

51
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,136
We'll dial down the power. 60%.

52
00:03:00,206 --> 00:03:02,731
The doors are pretty thick,

53
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:07,836
and the actual bunker is way underground,
hundreds of feet. I'd say it's worth a shot.

54
00:03:09,615 --> 00:03:10,912
Yeah.

55
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,313
All right, give us the coordinates.

56
00:03:26,297 --> 00:03:27,355
I got a lock.

57
00:03:28,566 --> 00:03:31,500
Lieutenant, we are ready to fire.
Are you clear of the area?

58
00:03:31,568 --> 00:03:32,626
<i>Yes, sir. Fire away.</i>

59
00:03:49,986 --> 00:03:51,351
Lieutenant?

60
00:03:52,755 --> 00:03:54,416
<i>Colonel, we're on-site.</i>

61
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,784
Nice shooting. It worked.

62
00:04:05,968 --> 00:04:08,562
There's still power. That's a good sign.

63
00:04:08,638 --> 00:04:11,765
My father worked down here.
He would sometimes bring me with him.

64
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,934
I remember running through these halls
as a child.

65
00:04:50,642 --> 00:04:51,666
Hello?

66
00:04:54,946 --> 00:04:56,277
What is this room?

67
00:04:56,348 --> 00:04:58,009
The Teneran archive.

68
00:04:59,084 --> 00:05:02,576
The entire history of our people
is stored here.

69
00:05:03,155 --> 00:05:06,056
Let's hope it can tell us
what happened to them.

70
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:22,864
<i>- What the hell is this?
I don't know!</i>

71
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,099
<i>This isn't Earth!</i>

72
00:05:24,174 --> 00:05:25,766
<i>Something obviously went wrong!</i>

73
00:05:25,842 --> 00:05:31,041
<i>All right, Greer, James, organize teams!
We need to find shelter!</i>

74
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,378
<i>- Where's Telford?
He didn't make it!</i>

75
00:05:33,616 --> 00:05:36,050
<i>- Why? What happened to him?
I don't know!</i>

76
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,216
<i>- You brought a Kino?
I know we weren't supposed to...</i>

77
00:05:38,288 --> 00:05:39,653
<i>Find a planet!</i>

78
00:05:39,723 --> 00:05:41,122
<i>Can you redialDestiny?</i>

79
00:05:41,191 --> 00:05:42,385
<i>It's gone!</i>

80
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:44,484
<i>All right, everyone, stay calm!
Stay close!</i>

81
00:05:45,128 --> 00:05:46,356
<i>Turn this off!</i>

82
00:05:48,597 --> 00:05:52,033
The first recording stored
in the Teneran archive.

83
00:05:52,901 --> 00:05:54,801
2,000 years ago.

84
00:05:55,604 --> 00:05:57,572
I'm still trying to wrap my mind
around that.

85
00:05:58,006 --> 00:05:59,701
See what else they've got.

86
00:05:59,908 --> 00:06:03,070
<i>Okay, communications are up.
We should be able to talk to Destiny.</i>

87
00:06:03,144 --> 00:06:04,577
Just hit that button.

88
00:06:04,645 --> 00:06:06,545
- This one?
- Yeah.

89
00:06:06,614 --> 00:06:07,842
Colonel, this is Scott, do you read?

90
00:06:11,352 --> 00:06:12,410
Yeah, we read you.

91
00:06:12,487 --> 00:06:14,580
Yeah, we are in one of the archive rooms.

92
00:06:14,655 --> 00:06:16,452
There's a bunch of them, on several levels.

93
00:06:17,258 --> 00:06:18,519
Still no people?

94
00:06:18,658 --> 00:06:19,784
Not a soul.

95
00:06:19,893 --> 00:06:21,155
Well, we have power, though.

96
00:06:21,228 --> 00:06:25,426
The grid draws from a combo
of solar, wind and geothermal energy.

97
00:06:25,766 --> 00:06:28,132
<i>- Is there anything worth salvaging?
Tons!</i>

98
00:06:28,335 --> 00:06:30,200
<i>We found the Testament
people were talking about,</i>

99
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,603
<i>the entire Teneran repository,
thousands of Kino recordings,</i>

100
00:06:33,774 --> 00:06:34,968
historical documents,

101
00:06:35,142 --> 00:06:37,269
<i>a detailed account of when
we first got here from Destiny.</i>

102
00:06:37,577 --> 00:06:39,601
None of which is any good to us right now.

103
00:06:39,678 --> 00:06:42,647
We've got a ship full of people.
We need supplies for life support.

104
00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:46,349
There's also food storage.
Canned goods, survival-type rations.

105
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:49,885
<i>Good, we'll use the shuttles to start
ferrying supplies to Destiny.</i>

106
00:06:50,054 --> 00:06:52,284
- You should go down, check the place out.
- Okay.

107
00:06:52,357 --> 00:06:53,949
<i>- Keep me posted.
Yes, sir.</i>

108
00:06:56,995 --> 00:06:59,725
<i>Colonel!
People are starting to pass out.</i>

109
00:06:59,798 --> 00:07:02,096
<i>- Atmosphere's way too thin.
- We've got four addresses.</i>

110
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:04,032
<i>Start dialing.
- Whoa, wait!</i>

111
00:07:04,102 --> 00:07:07,333
<i>What if they're worse than this place?
We can't just walk through blind.</i>

112
00:07:07,405 --> 00:07:10,306
<i>- We'll just send a Kino through first.
- What, there's more than one?</i>

113
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:13,367
<i>Six, actually. I wasn't the only one
who decided to sneak one through.</i>

114
00:07:13,445 --> 00:07:14,776
<i>Start dialing!</i>

115
00:07:18,247 --> 00:07:21,444
- Long way down, huh?
- Yeah, my ears popped on the way.

116
00:07:21,684 --> 00:07:23,083
I like the muzak, though.

117
00:07:23,586 --> 00:07:24,917
So this is the archive room?

118
00:07:25,421 --> 00:07:27,821
Yeah, the main one. Five others above us.

119
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:32,190
Above that, living quarters, tech
and other supplies, food storage.

120
00:07:32,261 --> 00:07:34,024
Scott and Greer are already up there
scouting the place.

121
00:07:34,096 --> 00:07:35,085
Where you going?

122
00:07:35,665 --> 00:07:37,428
- To join them.
They don't need any help.

123
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,489
Young's sending down...

124
00:07:41,437 --> 00:07:42,563
Yup.

125
00:07:44,707 --> 00:07:46,937
<i>- Colonel, this is Scott, come in.
Go ahead.</i>

126
00:07:47,844 --> 00:07:51,176
<i>Yeah, this planet looks good.
You can start sending people through.</i>

127
00:07:51,413 --> 00:07:52,539
<i>Copy that.</i>

128
00:07:52,781 --> 00:07:55,544
<i>Well, this is it, our new home,</i>

129
00:07:57,651 --> 00:07:59,619
<i>a planet known only to God.</i>

130
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,257
Hell of a lot of data here.

131
00:08:04,325 --> 00:08:06,987
Yeah, it looks like
they documented everything.

132
00:08:07,061 --> 00:08:09,427
"It is easier to know where you are going

133
00:08:09,497 --> 00:08:13,058
"when you know where you have been."
Eli Wallace.

134
00:08:18,905 --> 00:08:21,465
You know, it's going to take years
to get through all this.

135
00:08:21,641 --> 00:08:23,939
<i>- We'll bring it back to Destiny.
- Yeah.</i>

136
00:08:24,077 --> 00:08:25,840
These drives are built
right into the structure,

137
00:08:25,912 --> 00:08:28,073
so I don't think we're going to be able
to physically move them.

138
00:08:28,147 --> 00:08:31,139
So we configure an uplink, stream the data.

139
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:32,945
My thoughts exactly.

140
00:08:37,356 --> 00:08:38,584
- Brody.
- Hmm.

141
00:08:39,925 --> 00:08:40,983
- Brody!
- Hmm!

142
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,558
Sorry.

143
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:48,890
Is it okay if I do this?

144
00:08:48,966 --> 00:08:52,367
Uh... Maybe I should do it.

145
00:08:53,638 --> 00:08:55,868
You are the founding father
of the enemy nation, after all.

146
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,066
Hmm.

147
00:08:58,276 --> 00:08:59,641
Futura.

148
00:09:01,979 --> 00:09:04,038
- That's just stupid.
- Enough with the name.

149
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:10,709
<i>That's it.
- Some people brought through</i>

150
00:09:10,787 --> 00:09:13,119
<i>clothing items, hairpins, bandannas.
We're going through it all.</i>

151
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,416
<i>Not much.</i>

152
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:16,516
<i>We just have to make do
until Rush figures out where we are</i>

153
00:09:16,593 --> 00:09:18,253
<i>and brings Destiny back
in range so we can dial.</i>

154
00:09:19,161 --> 00:09:22,653
<i>Seriously?
Adam, Destiny's gone. Destroyed.</i>

155
00:09:22,731 --> 00:09:24,961
<i>We don't know that for certain.
No, we don't,</i>

156
00:09:25,034 --> 00:09:27,628
<i>but we also don't know
if this is present day, either.</i>

157
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,037
<i>We were dialing inside a star.
It could've hit a solar flare.</i>

158
00:09:31,106 --> 00:09:35,202
<i>For all we know, we could've gone back
in time, or forward, days, months, years.</i>

159
00:09:35,277 --> 00:09:38,303
<i>The fact is, we're stuck here now
for God knows how long,</i>

160
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:43,044
<i>so we need to build shelter,
we need to find food. Let's move.</i>

161
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:51,086
Rush, come check this out!

162
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:55,489
2,000 years
on the other side of the universe,

163
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:59,325
and beef jerky survives.

164
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:03,635
Hey, there you are!

165
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:08,330
<i>Eli and the others are working on a way to
upload the archive back up to Destiny.</i>

166
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:11,866
If we try to go through it all down here,
we'd never leave.

167
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,769
What are you reading?

168
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,481
There are thousands of books in here.

169
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,418
A bunch of school textbooks,
math, science, all written by Eli.

170
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,115
- The college dropout.
- Yeah.

171
00:10:26,891 --> 00:10:28,552
So you've been sitting down here
reading textbooks?

172
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:30,117
No, I found my diary.

173
00:10:31,229 --> 00:10:32,423
I know, weird.

174
00:10:33,498 --> 00:10:36,228
My first entry when we got to this planet,

175
00:10:36,801 --> 00:10:40,897
"The air is good. Plenty of trees,
fresh water, a lot like Earth.

176
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:44,198
<i>"Two weeks have gone by,
and we now have a name for our home.</i>

177
00:10:44,275 --> 00:10:46,573
<i>"Novus. It means new.</i>

178
00:10:46,945 --> 00:10:49,777
<i>"We're trying to settle in,
get some decent shelters built.</i>

179
00:10:49,847 --> 00:10:51,542
<i>"I'm still not sleeping well.</i>

180
00:10:51,849 --> 00:10:53,817
<i>"Never thought I'd say this,</i>

181
00:10:54,251 --> 00:10:55,479
<i>"but I miss Destiny."</i>

182
00:10:55,653 --> 00:10:58,281
Look, I already told you
we can't move there.

183
00:10:58,989 --> 00:11:01,480
Why not? It's not far.
It's flat, wide open, plenty of room...

184
00:11:01,558 --> 00:11:04,253
Because it's a flood plain.
First rain, and we're washed out.

185
00:11:04,327 --> 00:11:07,125
We've got good protection here, up slope,
out of the wind.

186
00:11:07,196 --> 00:11:09,426
Plenty of trees to build proper shelter,
homes...

187
00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:11,194
How? We have no tools.

188
00:11:11,901 --> 00:11:14,597
One of the springs on the plain
is seeping ferric hydroxide.

189
00:11:14,671 --> 00:11:16,002
Bog iron deposits.

190
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:18,406
It should get us
jump-started on basic tool-making,

191
00:11:18,473 --> 00:11:20,304
then we can really speed things up.

192
00:11:20,842 --> 00:11:22,810
I still think it's a good idea
to look for a better...

193
00:11:22,878 --> 00:11:24,140
You know what, it was your good idea

194
00:11:24,212 --> 00:11:25,839
that got us stuck on this planet
in the first place!

195
00:11:25,914 --> 00:11:28,041
What? You agreed with it...

196
00:11:28,116 --> 00:11:30,050
We are here because of your calculations!

197
00:11:30,118 --> 00:11:33,576
Both of you, stop this right now.
We're not doing this again, all right?

198
00:11:34,022 --> 00:11:36,718
The decision is made. We are staying here.

199
00:11:36,858 --> 00:11:40,021
Sir, we're going to have to build a fence.
There's wildlife on this planet.

200
00:11:40,094 --> 00:11:42,028
We just saw
some nasty-looking creatures on our scout.

201
00:11:42,096 --> 00:11:44,257
- Great.
I've got people out on patrol,

202
00:11:44,465 --> 00:11:46,160
but we're going to run out of ammo
real quick.

203
00:11:46,267 --> 00:11:48,359
- Yeah, hence the fence.
Right.

204
00:11:48,435 --> 00:11:51,131
Sounds good. How about we do it. Let's go.

205
00:11:55,241 --> 00:11:56,674
It's amazing.

206
00:11:57,844 --> 00:12:02,247
We came here with hardly anything,
and 2,000 years later...

207
00:12:02,315 --> 00:12:03,873
Our kids done good.

208
00:12:06,686 --> 00:12:08,347
Kind of want to read the rest of it.

209
00:12:09,355 --> 00:12:10,686
See who ended up with...

210
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,119
Under the table!

211
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,173
Uh, guys?

212
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,575
You might want to get moving
on that data transfer.

213
00:12:42,487 --> 00:12:45,183
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

214
00:12:45,256 --> 00:12:46,587
Whoo. I hate earthquakes.

215
00:12:46,991 --> 00:12:49,288
Yeah? It's my first, actually.

216
00:12:52,162 --> 00:12:53,561
Greer, this is Scott, you okay up there?

217
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,061
Yeah, everybody's all good.

218
00:12:55,132 --> 00:12:57,099
We're sending down additional teams
to help with those supplies.

219
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,531
We need to pick up the pace.

220
00:12:58,868 --> 00:12:59,994
<i>Copy that.</i>

221
00:13:02,138 --> 00:13:04,504
<i>"Six weeks on the planet.</i>

222
00:13:04,573 --> 00:13:07,064
<i>"We've been doing okay,
for the most part.</i>

223
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,043
<i>"Until today."</i>

224
00:13:09,245 --> 00:13:10,439
Garden?

225
00:13:11,013 --> 00:13:15,279
The fruit that Scott and Greer found?
Planting some seeds, see what happens.

226
00:13:17,285 --> 00:13:18,411
T. J!

227
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,650
<i>"Volker's condition is
getting worse.</i>

228
00:13:26,728 --> 00:13:28,423
<i>T.J. doesn't know
what's wrong with him.</i>

229
00:13:29,397 --> 00:13:31,228
<i>"She thinks maybe his
kidneys are failing,</i>

230
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:34,028
<i>"but without any medical equipment,
she can't be sure.</i>

231
00:13:34,735 --> 00:13:36,794
<i>"And there's nothing she can do
to help him."</i>

232
00:13:44,711 --> 00:13:46,906
<i>"Today we had our first funeral.</i>

233
00:13:49,315 --> 00:13:51,146
<i>"Dr. Dale Volker."</i>

234
00:14:02,795 --> 00:14:05,696
Hey, Lieutenant Scott just radioed.

235
00:14:05,765 --> 00:14:06,754
The shuttle's loaded

236
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:09,233
<i>and ready to take you back to
Destiny to start the uplink.</i>

237
00:14:22,046 --> 00:14:24,310
A small cut,
but it may need a couple of stitches.

238
00:14:24,381 --> 00:14:27,873
- I'm fine...
- You will be, once I patch you up.

239
00:14:34,425 --> 00:14:35,892
You're not getting enough rest.

240
00:14:36,227 --> 00:14:37,353
Nobody is.

241
00:14:38,896 --> 00:14:40,295
The others follow your lead.

242
00:14:40,431 --> 00:14:42,456
What is that? The stitches, what is it?

243
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:45,261
Tendons from one of those animals
Greer killed.

244
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:47,929
The needle could use a little work, though.

245
00:14:48,604 --> 00:14:50,265
Best Brody could make on short notice.

246
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:53,600
You okay?

247
00:14:54,443 --> 00:14:55,569
Yeah.

248
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:58,379
With all this construction going on,
people need to be more careful.

249
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,512
Not overdo it, know when to rest.

250
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:05,343
Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.

251
00:15:09,057 --> 00:15:11,025
Okay, there you go.

252
00:15:11,093 --> 00:15:13,357
- Take it easy and watch for infection.
- Got it.

253
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:15,556
Son of a...

254
00:15:16,098 --> 00:15:19,260
You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good. I'm good...

255
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,561
Hey, listen.

256
00:15:21,435 --> 00:15:22,800
Nobody blames you.

257
00:15:24,872 --> 00:15:26,634
It is what it is.

258
00:15:28,174 --> 00:15:29,471
We're here,

259
00:15:31,478 --> 00:15:35,005
and we have our whole lives ahead.
Make the most of it.

260
00:15:39,085 --> 00:15:40,882
- That easy, huh?
- No.

261
00:15:43,123 --> 00:15:46,388
But beating yourself up every day
just makes it worse.

262
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,670
<i>The stargate was destroyed
in one of the eruptions,</i>

263
00:16:08,746 --> 00:16:10,680
<i>buried in lava decades ago.</i>

264
00:16:10,915 --> 00:16:12,974
Most of the people left the planet
before then,

265
00:16:13,184 --> 00:16:17,415
but after they lost the gate,
they needed to figure another way out.

266
00:16:18,956 --> 00:16:22,016
Both of the countries realized
they stood a better chance of survival

267
00:16:22,092 --> 00:16:23,491
if they worked together,

268
00:16:24,194 --> 00:16:29,154
so they pooled their resources
and they built ships. Huge, huge ships.

269
00:16:29,366 --> 00:16:31,095
<i>Not capable of FTL,</i>

270
00:16:31,168 --> 00:16:33,898
<i>but big enough to evacuate
the rest of the population.</i>

271
00:16:34,338 --> 00:16:35,464
Where did they go?

272
00:16:35,605 --> 00:16:39,336
They went to one of the planets they had
previously sent an expedition team to.

273
00:16:39,576 --> 00:16:42,009
<i>10 days travel for us on
Destiny in FTL,</i>

274
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:44,876
but it'll take them a few hundred years
with their ships.

275
00:16:45,014 --> 00:16:47,345
Good to know they got their act together.

276
00:16:58,626 --> 00:17:01,424
Hey, look, we never really talked.

277
00:17:02,931 --> 00:17:04,990
Don't worry about it. I'm okay.

278
00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:10,899
See, this is always the time
I do something to sabotage things.

279
00:17:11,806 --> 00:17:13,899
It's kind of a defense mechanism.

280
00:17:15,276 --> 00:17:16,503
Tough to explain.

281
00:17:17,845 --> 00:17:19,243
It's not tough at all.

282
00:17:20,313 --> 00:17:22,372
Everything you've ever cared about
has been taken from you

283
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:25,249
so you're trying to make sure
it doesn't happen again.

284
00:17:26,686 --> 00:17:28,779
This is a huge step for you, Matt.

285
00:17:29,722 --> 00:17:31,121
I'm proud of you.

286
00:17:32,158 --> 00:17:34,183
You should be proud of yourself.

287
00:17:35,361 --> 00:17:38,387
Well, still, I'll understand
if you don't wanna come.

288
00:17:38,598 --> 00:17:41,294
Are you kidding? First wedding on Novus?

289
00:17:42,568 --> 00:17:44,399
Camile's gonna make a pie, so...

290
00:17:46,305 --> 00:17:47,464
I wouldn't miss it.

291
00:17:52,677 --> 00:17:55,145
<i>"Today was a
good day on Novus.</i>

292
00:17:57,214 --> 00:17:59,011
<i>"The best day yet."</i>

293
00:18:11,362 --> 00:18:13,956
<i>So, everybody's hooking up.</i>

294
00:18:15,066 --> 00:18:16,726
Matt and Chloe are married.

295
00:18:17,067 --> 00:18:20,468
<i>Now rumor is Varro and James
are getting together.</i>

296
00:18:21,137 --> 00:18:22,126
<i>Figures.</i>

297
00:18:22,972 --> 00:18:26,772
<i>T.J. just had her baby boy,
named him Steven, after her father.</i>

298
00:18:28,912 --> 00:18:31,676
<i>Yeah. Everybody's getting together,</i>

299
00:18:33,982 --> 00:18:35,313
<i>except me</i>

300
00:18:36,618 --> 00:18:37,744
<i>and Brody.</i>

301
00:18:38,921 --> 00:18:41,583
<i>This is Eli.
Is Volker back on the ship yet?</i>

302
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,155
Yeah, I'm here. Are you ready?

303
00:18:43,358 --> 00:18:44,416
All set.

304
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,150
We're starting the transfer now.

305
00:18:49,163 --> 00:18:50,391
Eli, look at this.

306
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:53,465
The factory where
they built their interstellar ships?

307
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:55,832
According to this,
there's one ship still in there.

308
00:18:55,903 --> 00:18:58,463
It was still under construction
when they left the planet.

309
00:18:58,539 --> 00:18:59,938
How close to completion?

310
00:19:00,007 --> 00:19:01,133
Is it operational?

311
00:19:01,209 --> 00:19:02,676
I don't know.

312
00:19:04,412 --> 00:19:06,539
<i>- What?
Let's see.</i>

313
00:19:08,116 --> 00:19:12,108
<i>Come on. I'm documenting your progress.
You'll thank me for this later, I promise.</i>

314
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,909
<i>Come on.</i>

315
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,687
<i>- And how far along are you?
- Six months.</i>

316
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:23,958
<i>Matt's going crazy trying to build them
a house before the baby arrives.</i>

317
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,395
<i>I told him not to worry about it,
but you know Matt.</i>

318
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:27,955
<i>Sign he's going to
make a great father.</i>

319
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,398
<i>And you a great uncle.</i>

320
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:36,336
Oh, crap.

321
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,134
I just accessed
the geothermal monitoring data.

322
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:43,511
It turns out their theory's right.
A black hole has entered this system.

323
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:46,414
The tidal forces
are ripping this planet apart.

324
00:19:46,651 --> 00:19:49,118
- Is that a fault line?
- Yeah! Running right under the city.

325
00:19:49,186 --> 00:19:50,778
Very active, and very shallow.

326
00:19:50,854 --> 00:19:53,118
The crust is increasingly thin,
like shattering glass.

327
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,988
Magma bubbling up everywhere.
We can't stay here much longer.

328
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:58,459
The database is immense.
The transfer could take days.

329
00:19:58,529 --> 00:20:00,463
37 hours with my compression algorithm.

330
00:20:02,065 --> 00:20:03,362
Well, let's hope that's enough time.

331
00:20:06,203 --> 00:20:08,694
Good, good, you're doing good.

332
00:20:08,772 --> 00:20:09,796
Where's T. J?

333
00:20:09,873 --> 00:20:11,704
Eli went to get her.
Don't worry, don't worry.

334
00:20:11,775 --> 00:20:13,675
You're doing fine. I love you.
Just don't forget to breathe...

335
00:20:13,744 --> 00:20:15,405
Shut up and leave me alone!

336
00:20:15,712 --> 00:20:17,508
Oh, thank God! Come on...

337
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,047
- Okay, just breathe.
- Yeah, yeah,

338
00:20:19,115 --> 00:20:21,549
- I've been telling her to keep breathing...
- No, you!

339
00:20:21,617 --> 00:20:22,777
Okay.

340
00:20:22,852 --> 00:20:25,150
- Wow, just on time. You're crowning.
- What can I do?

341
00:20:25,221 --> 00:20:26,847
You can get ready to cut the cord.

342
00:20:27,589 --> 00:20:31,320
Okay, Chloe, one last push. Ready?

343
00:20:45,373 --> 00:20:46,430
It's a boy.

344
00:20:54,148 --> 00:20:55,775
I can't believe it.

345
00:20:57,585 --> 00:20:58,984
I'm a daddy.

346
00:20:59,987 --> 00:21:01,784
You have any names picked out?

347
00:21:04,225 --> 00:21:05,418
Dale.

348
00:21:11,197 --> 00:21:13,062
<i>Babies are being born.</i>

349
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:17,396
<i>Chloe, Park, James.</i>

350
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:22,673
<i>T.J. and Colonel Young already have
two: a boy and a girl.</i>

351
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:31,405
<i>It's good, you know, for the future
of our settlement,</i>

352
00:21:33,051 --> 00:21:35,110
<i>but still, sometimes...</i>

353
00:21:36,288 --> 00:21:38,153
<i>- It's a girl.
- Huh.</i>

354
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,755
<i>Mom and baby are fine.</i>

355
00:21:45,496 --> 00:21:46,757
<i>You okay?</i>

356
00:21:47,797 --> 00:21:50,789
Yeah. Just, uh, tired.

357
00:21:52,969 --> 00:21:54,061
Yeah.

358
00:22:07,651 --> 00:22:09,551
Me and Corporal Barnes?

359
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:12,945
Something worth pursuing?

360
00:22:43,284 --> 00:22:44,808
- Rush?
- Yeah.

361
00:22:47,287 --> 00:22:50,415
<i>- How bad?
Park says 6.2. Pretty strong.</i>

362
00:22:52,092 --> 00:22:54,652
The fault line they discovered
is getting wider.

363
00:22:54,895 --> 00:22:56,226
The city's crumbling into it.

364
00:22:56,396 --> 00:22:57,794
All right, well, be smart.

365
00:22:57,863 --> 00:22:59,524
Don't wait too long
to get the hell out of there.

366
00:22:59,732 --> 00:23:01,666
We won't.
We've got a pretty good eye on it,

367
00:23:02,168 --> 00:23:04,693
and it looks like this bunker
was built to withstand a lot.

368
00:23:04,937 --> 00:23:06,165
I think we're okay.

369
00:23:11,477 --> 00:23:13,604
And?
- And what?

370
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,743
How was it?
- It was fine.

371
00:23:17,182 --> 00:23:19,742
We had a very pleasant dinner.

372
00:23:21,786 --> 00:23:26,849
Of all the dates I've had since we got here,
she's easily the most compatible with me.

373
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:31,019
- So then what's the problem?
- I don't know.

374
00:23:32,397 --> 00:23:33,864
I mean,

375
00:23:35,632 --> 00:23:39,363
I've already found my soul mate.
I don't need another.

376
00:23:41,405 --> 00:23:45,273
Steven, no, don't eat that!
Don't eat that...

377
00:23:46,309 --> 00:23:48,903
- That was a close call.
- Yeah.

378
00:23:49,912 --> 00:23:51,174
You okay?

379
00:23:53,316 --> 00:23:54,783
Yeah.

380
00:23:55,385 --> 00:23:56,409
Yeah.

381
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:04,927
<i>Records say there's actually
a ship still in the factory</i>

382
00:24:04,994 --> 00:24:06,427
a few kilometers outside the city.

383
00:24:07,063 --> 00:24:09,327
Doesn't say if it's operational or not,
but if it is,

384
00:24:09,399 --> 00:24:11,458
it'll be capable of holding
the entire group of descendants.

385
00:24:11,734 --> 00:24:13,860
All right. Go ahead and check it out.

386
00:24:14,102 --> 00:24:16,433
<i>- How's the transfer coming?
So far, so good.</i>

387
00:24:16,504 --> 00:24:19,996
Just over 900 exabytes.
Still a drop in the bucket, though.

388
00:24:21,142 --> 00:24:22,769
<i>Perfect. I need you to take
me back to Destiny.</i>

389
00:24:23,077 --> 00:24:25,068
No, I'm flying them over
to check out that ship-building factory.

390
00:24:25,146 --> 00:24:27,341
<i>Yeah, fine, then you can take me back
to the Destiny.</i>

391
00:24:44,598 --> 00:24:48,727
<i>My symptoms are getting worse.
It's affecting my legs.</i>

392
00:24:50,369 --> 00:24:52,667
<i>I'm losing my balance, stumbling.</i>

393
00:24:53,672 --> 00:24:55,333
<i>My speech is also...</i>

394
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:59,308
<i>I'm slurring words here and there.
I have trouble eating.</i>

395
00:25:02,147 --> 00:25:05,378
<i>I wish I could do
a more accurate diagnosis, but...</i>

396
00:25:08,787 --> 00:25:13,019
<i>It sounds like ALS, Lou
Gehrig's Disease.</i>

397
00:25:21,999 --> 00:25:23,899
Tamara, I just heard.

398
00:25:26,437 --> 00:25:27,869
This disease,

399
00:25:28,772 --> 00:25:32,037
just because the other you got it
when you came to this planet,

400
00:25:32,142 --> 00:25:33,666
it doesn't mean you'll get it.

401
00:25:33,743 --> 00:25:34,903
Yeah, it does.

402
00:25:35,412 --> 00:25:39,314
It's not something that you contract.
I'm carrying it right now.

403
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:42,751
Is there anything you can do?
Any medicines?

404
00:25:43,687 --> 00:25:45,278
There's no cure.

405
00:25:55,064 --> 00:25:56,292
Coming up on the factory.

406
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:18,978
T.J.

407
00:26:19,052 --> 00:26:20,280
Colonel, you didn't have
to come down here.

408
00:26:24,157 --> 00:26:27,490
<i>Volker's checking
Destiny's medical database to see...</i>

409
00:26:27,928 --> 00:26:29,054
To see if there's anything,

410
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,121
anything in there at all
on this disease, okay?

411
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,728
The first symptoms presented five years
after we arrived on the planet.

412
00:26:40,374 --> 00:26:41,966
I died a few years after that.

413
00:26:45,076 --> 00:26:46,941
This is Scott.
Has Colonel Young arrived there yet?

414
00:26:52,317 --> 00:26:54,182
Yeah, Scott, I'm here.

415
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,778
Yeah, we just did a pass over the site
where the factory used to be.

416
00:26:59,891 --> 00:27:00,880
It's gone.

417
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,627
The fault line cut right through it.
It's a river of lava now.

418
00:27:04,696 --> 00:27:06,561
We need to leave this planet immediately.

419
00:27:06,831 --> 00:27:08,958
<i>Agreed.
Scott, get everyone back to Destiny,</i>

420
00:27:09,134 --> 00:27:11,602
<i>then get back down here.
We'll start clearing out.</i>

421
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,063
<i>Yeah, but, sir, what about
all those people back on Destiny?</i>

422
00:27:14,139 --> 00:27:16,936
- Nearest planet is 10 days away...
- No, don't worry about it, they'll be fine.

423
00:27:17,007 --> 00:27:18,634
<i>Yeah, we don't have a choice.
We have to...</i>

424
00:27:19,143 --> 00:27:22,168
<i>- We have to get everyone back on board.
- Copy.</i>

425
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:48,183
About a third of the database
has been transferred.

426
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:49,453
Still a long way to go.

427
00:28:49,827 --> 00:28:50,816
We're cutting it short.

428
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:54,296
I want everyone back to the surface
as soon as possible for evac.

429
00:28:54,465 --> 00:28:55,830
But, Colonel, there's still so much
that we can...

430
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:58,059
Get down. Get down.

431
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:09,378
<i>- You all right?
Yeah.</i>

432
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,914
All right, get back to the surface.
Wait for Scott's shuttle.

433
00:29:18,254 --> 00:29:19,482
You all right?

434
00:29:20,122 --> 00:29:21,487
I heard the others talking about you.

435
00:29:22,224 --> 00:29:25,091
The disease you carry, we have a cure.

436
00:29:25,795 --> 00:29:26,784
You do?

437
00:29:27,129 --> 00:29:30,223
Our scientists discovered it
over 200 years ago.

438
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:33,530
Cures for other diseases, as well.
All of them in the archive.

439
00:29:42,678 --> 00:29:44,907
<i>Rush, are you
back on Destiny?</i>

440
00:29:46,614 --> 00:29:48,741
- Yes, I'm here.
- Then why didn't you tell me?

441
00:29:49,417 --> 00:29:51,782
I'm sorry, I wasn't aware
I had to check in with you.

442
00:29:51,852 --> 00:29:53,183
<i>You heard about T. J?</i>

443
00:29:55,422 --> 00:29:56,446
Yeah.

444
00:29:56,557 --> 00:29:58,286
I'm searching the Ancient medical database

445
00:29:58,358 --> 00:30:01,919
for anything on ALS,
and I could really use some help.

446
00:30:02,129 --> 00:30:03,858
I'm sorry, I'm a bit busy at the moment.

447
00:30:04,298 --> 00:30:06,289
- Doing what?
- Something more pressing.

448
00:30:06,366 --> 00:30:07,833
I'll be with you when I'm finished.

449
00:30:08,836 --> 00:30:14,069
<i>Our son, Alan, just broke the news.
His wife, Claire, is pregnant.</i>

450
00:30:14,974 --> 00:30:18,705
<i>Grandparents.
We're going to be grandparents.</i>

451
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,777
<i>- Well, it's that time again.
- The yearly family reunion.</i>

452
00:30:25,585 --> 00:30:28,179
<i>Three kids and five grandkids.</i>

453
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,280
<i>Just drafted a rough outline
of a constitution.</i>

454
00:30:31,957 --> 00:30:33,584
<i>People are responding well to it,</i>

455
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:35,957
<i>for the most part.</i>

456
00:30:36,094 --> 00:30:39,894
<i>Oh, and we're converting
one of the storage houses</i>

457
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:41,296
<i>into a schoolroom.</i>

458
00:30:42,334 --> 00:30:47,032
<i>Eli's teaching the kids.
He's actually quite good at it.</i>

459
00:30:48,572 --> 00:30:52,064
<i>- A wonderful teacher.
Hmm. Thanks.</i>

460
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:58,314
<i>Four sons, three daughters,
15 grandchildren.</i>

461
00:31:01,385 --> 00:31:02,716
<i>I'm tired.</i>

462
00:31:05,422 --> 00:31:09,983
<i>All these kids, laughing and dancing.
Everybody dancing.</i>

463
00:31:11,928 --> 00:31:16,261
<i>Tearing up my lawn. When I was a kid,
we had more respect for people's...</i>

464
00:31:17,099 --> 00:31:20,796
Touched down, sir. Greer and his team
are bringing up the next batch of supplies.

465
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:24,671
Copy that. Chloe and Wray
are also headed up with Yaozu.

466
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,800
Take Brody and Park with you.
I'll take everyone else on the other shuttle.

467
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,241
<i>Copy that.</i>

468
00:31:29,378 --> 00:31:30,868
Eli, anything?

469
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:32,910
We had to compress the data
to speed up the transfer.

470
00:31:33,048 --> 00:31:35,608
One huge file.
Which means I can't do a specific search

471
00:31:35,684 --> 00:31:37,845
for ALS until we uncompress
what we've already uploaded,

472
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,684
and I can't do that
until we stop the transfer.

473
00:31:41,456 --> 00:31:43,980
About a third of the database
has already gone through,

474
00:31:44,058 --> 00:31:45,752
so there's a one-in-three chance
it's in there.

475
00:31:45,826 --> 00:31:48,624
The longer we wait, the better the chances.
I say it's worth it to stay and...

476
00:32:03,643 --> 00:32:05,577
<i>"Colonel Young
won re-election.</i>

477
00:32:05,645 --> 00:32:09,137
<i>"Most of us are happy, but some
still want to do things differently.</i>

478
00:32:10,984 --> 00:32:12,952
<i>"Today a group of them announced
they're leaving.</i>

479
00:32:13,687 --> 00:32:18,316
<i>"Whether they stay here on Novus or
gate to another planet, they didn't say."</i>

480
00:32:19,258 --> 00:32:23,159
Power's cut off. Data transfer's
shut down and communications.

481
00:32:24,362 --> 00:32:26,887
A big section of stairs are out
about six levels up.

482
00:32:27,398 --> 00:32:29,059
Scott, this is Young, can you read?

483
00:32:29,701 --> 00:32:31,965
<i>- Yeah, Colonel.
- Everyone make it out?</i>

484
00:32:32,971 --> 00:32:35,599
Yeah, everyone's okay.
They're all aboard. You all right?

485
00:32:35,807 --> 00:32:37,468
Yeah, we're fine, but we're cut off.

486
00:32:37,876 --> 00:32:39,969
No power to the elevators,
and the stairs are out.

487
00:32:41,246 --> 00:32:43,339
We're gonna have to climb up the ladder.

488
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,210
Eli...

489
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:54,850
Great.

490
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:21,147
Colonel, this is Scott,
we made it down to Level 14.

491
00:33:21,283 --> 00:33:23,547
Stairs are out below.
We got rope if you need it.

492
00:33:23,618 --> 00:33:25,848
<i>You should be
on your way back to Destiny.</i>

493
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,650
We'll leave when you leave, sir.

494
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:29,748
There's Eli.

495
00:34:01,821 --> 00:34:02,913
Platform!

496
00:34:25,209 --> 00:34:27,473
<i>Throw down the rope!
We just lost Varro!</i>

497
00:34:40,024 --> 00:34:41,548
- You all right?
- Yeah.

498
00:34:46,496 --> 00:34:48,157
<i>Okay, pull her up.</i>

499
00:34:54,169 --> 00:34:57,036
<i>We got her!
Sending the rope back down.</i>

500
00:35:14,589 --> 00:35:16,284
<i>Okay, pull!</i>

501
00:35:39,446 --> 00:35:40,743
He's alive.

502
00:35:54,593 --> 00:35:56,857
Pull! Now!

503
00:36:02,635 --> 00:36:03,693
Where are the rest?

504
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:06,764
- We put them on the other shuttle.
- Everyone hang on!

505
00:36:42,673 --> 00:36:44,606
I'm sorry, Chloe.

506
00:36:46,608 --> 00:36:48,007
Sorry for what?

507
00:36:49,377 --> 00:36:51,140
I never got us home.

508
00:36:54,049 --> 00:36:56,279
Got here as quick as we could.

509
00:36:59,221 --> 00:37:00,415
Sara...

510
00:37:01,456 --> 00:37:03,185
I'm here, Dad.

511
00:37:03,925 --> 00:37:05,153
Colonel,

512
00:37:10,565 --> 00:37:11,964
we are home.

513
00:37:40,326 --> 00:37:44,227
For CO2 scrubbing.
- A highly advanced substance.

514
00:37:44,296 --> 00:37:47,129
Much more effective than lime.
This one canister alone will last for years.

515
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:48,799
And you brought back cases of it?

516
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:51,026
We'll certainly need it
with all these extra people on board.

517
00:37:51,503 --> 00:37:55,872
Well, it's just 10 days till we drop them off
with the people on the expedition planet.

518
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:57,167
Yeah.

519
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:05,346
It burns you up, doesn't it?

520
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,244
What?

521
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:09,319
<i>We did all right after
leaving Destiny.</i>

522
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,778
We got along just fine

523
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,082
without you.

524
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:22,821
Broken ribs. Lacerations, bruises.

525
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:27,632
He's stable for now,
but all we can do is wait and watch.

526
00:38:30,173 --> 00:38:34,234
We've been searching what we were
able to transfer from the archive.

527
00:38:35,712 --> 00:38:36,872
The ALS cure wasn't in there.

528
00:38:38,647 --> 00:38:41,138
<i>Well, what about
Destiny's Ancient database?</i>

529
00:38:41,283 --> 00:38:44,774
Nothing in there yet, either.
It's difficult.

530
00:38:45,086 --> 00:38:47,611
Different names for diseases, procedures.

531
00:38:47,789 --> 00:38:49,484
It's hard to do a quick search.

532
00:38:51,859 --> 00:38:55,317
What about the ships
that they used to evacuate Novus?

533
00:38:55,763 --> 00:38:57,628
They probably took a copy
of the archive with them,

534
00:38:57,699 --> 00:38:59,360
so when we drop people off on the planet...

535
00:38:59,434 --> 00:39:00,662
They won't be there yet.

536
00:39:03,071 --> 00:39:04,732
The ships don't have FTL.

537
00:39:05,506 --> 00:39:08,339
They won't arrive for 200 years,

538
00:39:08,509 --> 00:39:10,374
and finding them
in the middle of empty space...

539
00:39:10,445 --> 00:39:11,537
Yeah.

540
00:39:14,681 --> 00:39:18,411
But, T.J., there's so much else
that did make it in the transfer.

541
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:21,810
A ton of other medical stuff.

542
00:39:22,521 --> 00:39:25,581
We can learn from it,
from our descendants.

543
00:39:26,959 --> 00:39:28,586
We will figure out a cure.

544
00:39:33,132 --> 00:39:34,394
I know it.

545
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:48,944
I'd like to thank you all
for coming to this very special occasion,

546
00:39:49,247 --> 00:39:51,408
the dedication of our beautiful new school.

547
00:39:52,584 --> 00:39:57,213
My grandfather spent his life laying down
the foundation for our education system.

548
00:39:57,855 --> 00:40:00,346
It's why this new school bears his name.

549
00:40:00,658 --> 00:40:05,925
As principal, I'll do my best to uphold
his legacy of inquiry and discovery

550
00:40:07,131 --> 00:40:09,759
and to carry it forward
to future generations.

551
00:40:10,801 --> 00:40:13,428
Now, please help me welcome
our guest of honor,

552
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:17,831
two-term mayor,
the author of our constitution,

553
00:40:18,775 --> 00:40:22,643
<i>and the last surviving member
of the settlers from Destiny,</i>

554
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:25,112
Camile Wray.

555
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:46,291
I want to begin
with a few words of greeting.

556
00:40:51,272 --> 00:40:55,800
May all things go according to the wishes
of those that hear it.

557
00:40:56,777 --> 00:40:58,745
When we first arrived here,

558
00:40:59,914 --> 00:41:02,075
we thought we had failed.

559
00:41:02,983 --> 00:41:06,009
<i>We didn't achieve the
mission on Destiny,</i>

560
00:41:08,254 --> 00:41:11,781
but now, looking at all your smiling faces,

561
00:41:12,459 --> 00:41:14,892
at this beautiful new school,

562
00:41:16,528 --> 00:41:20,589
I can't help but feel a
great sense of pride

563
00:41:22,134 --> 00:41:23,499
and success.

564
00:41:26,772 --> 00:41:29,070
Because, as we discovered,

565
00:41:31,243 --> 00:41:34,735
our mission is, and always will be,

566
00:41:35,647 --> 00:41:37,547
the journey itself.
