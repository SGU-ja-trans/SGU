00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,438
RUSH: This is what Destiny intended from
the moment it entered the star system.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,429
YOUNG: We are going to survive.
We are going to make it home.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,989
I'm telling you,
this ship came here for a reason!

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,713
RUSH: Destiny is powered
by the stars themselves.

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,589
WRAY: He and Young
are bumping heads, yes.

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,069
Not sure which camp is the better choice.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,752
YOUNG: We just pretend
nothing happened?

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,400
We need to be ready
for the next encounter.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,391
For the sake of the crew.

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,198
For the sake of the crew.

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,748
JOHANSEN: Well,
the convulsions have stopped,

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,193
but he's completely unresponsive.

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,669
He's basically in a deep catatonic state.

14
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,230
This is Scott, sir.
We are in a bit of a pickle down here.

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,471
ELI: We haven't found any other sort of exit
or access to ground level.

16
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,313
We've got less than half an hour.
We're not going to make it.

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,188
SCOTT: They just jumped.

18
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,236
God be with you, Colonel.

19
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,113
All of you.

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,559
JOHANSEN: Colonel Young?

21
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,473
Colonel Young?

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,316
- Yeah.
- We're all here, sir.

23
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,879
I'm on my way.

24
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,316
Dr. Rush has just confirmed
that our current FTL jump

25
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,153
will take us between galaxies.

26
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,158
Which means it could take some time

27
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,629
before we are able to make
another gate connection

28
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,915
to replenish our supplies.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,073
Strict food and water rationing
will be reinstated as of now.

30
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,188
It also means that any hope of
rescuing Chloe Armstrong,

31
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,238
Eli Wallace,
or Lieutenant Matthew Scott is...

32
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,551
RUSH: Colonel Young,

33
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,915
would you please
join me in the Control Interface Room?

34
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,992
I'll be right there.

35
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,919
That is all.

36
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,395
I've figured out why the ship's
been trying to conserve power.

37
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,232
We're going to fall short.

38
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,153
- Short of what?
- Our destination, the other galaxy.

39
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,389
No matter how I do the sums,

40
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,835
or to what degree I try
and conserve power,

41
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,434
Destiny won't make it across the void.

42
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,111
But we just passed through a star.
We should be recharged.

43
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,760
Yes, we did,
but like everything else on this ship,

44
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,230
Destiny's FTL drive and power reserves
are nowhere near 100%.

45
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,790
The database says the ship barely made
the last three or four intergalactic jumps.

46
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,518
Recent battle damage
couldn't have helped.

47
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,910
But if the ship realizes that
it can't make it, why is it trying?

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,629
It's programmed to follow
a predetermined path.

49
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,517
Since we haven't managed
to take control of the ship,

50
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,160
our presence is secondary to that.

51
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,198
Destiny will eventually drift
the rest of the way,

52
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,874
but our bones will be dust by then.

53
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,030
So what do we do?

54
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,676
Well, I'm open to suggestions.

55
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,910
How much will we fall short?

56
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,276
50,000 light years, give or take.

57
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,669
- Just a few percent of the total.
- Yeah.

58
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,309
So what if we can increase
the FTL drive's efficiency?

59
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,632
Work better with
the same amount of power.

60
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,995
Yeah, five percent ought to do it, actually.

61
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,799
We don't know
how the engines work at all.

62
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,235
- We could just make things worse.
- Mr. Brody's right.

63
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,514
So am I the only one here who thinks

64
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,591
we shouldn't be screwing around
with Ancient drive technology,

65
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,352
unless we have a clue
about what we're doing?

66
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,793
Then we'll bring aboard
someone else that does.

67
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,757
I can think of two or three people
off the top of my head.

68
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,070
- Who's the best?
- Amanda Perry.

69
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,074
She was part of the team helping to
design the next generation of hyperdrives.

70
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,754
- There's really no one better qualified.
- Well, let's make that happen.

71
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,673
Let's make arrangements to
get her on board.

72
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,309
Colonel, for all her abilities,

73
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,110
there are certain disabilities
of which you should be made aware.

74
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,113
For how long?

75
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,156
RUSH: Potentially several weeks.

76
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,792
Of course, there'll be someone there to
assist with the day-to-day things.

77
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,238
She requires a respirator
in order to breathe.

78
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,679
Obviously, there's going to be
some kind of adjustment.

79
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,990
JAMES: Will I be able to see my family?

80
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,232
- They've got clearance.
- Then I'll do it, sir.

81
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,111
Lieutenant? You all right?

82
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,994
Mandy.

83
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,316
- Nick.
- Yeah.

84
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,029
God, I'm really here, aren't I?

85
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,359
You sure are.

86
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,312
It takes a moment to get used
to the transfer.

87
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,672
You're telling me.

88
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,789
I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't do it.

89
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,678
- Lieutenant...
- Just leave her. Leave her.

90
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,239
So, Lieutenant James had trouble
getting used to the ventilator.

91
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,199
I'll be fine.

92
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,153
Fix the ship.

93
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,999
Ms. Wray?

94
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,398
- Yes.
- Good.

95
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,516
Take all the time you need to adjust.

96
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,160
This is Mary.
She'll be your helper while you're here.

97
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,309
Hello.

98
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,757
She'll also brief you on how to
cope with your host's disabilities.

99
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,239
Afterwards, Dr. Strom was
hoping to see you.

100
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,389
WRAY: No.

101
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,318
I'm going home.

102
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,749
JOHANSEN: Hey.

103
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,478
I couldn't do it.

104
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,476
Yeah, I know. I heard.

105
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,953
It's okay.

106
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,911
No, it isn't. I let him down.

107
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,033
The Colonel?

108
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,113
Hey, listen, he's the last person you...

109
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,192
This is the Mess Hall, here.
Set this up a few months ago.

110
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,919
People come. Terrible food here.

111
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,358
PERRY: I recognize you.

112
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,949
Excuse me.

113
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,917
As I was saying, this is the Mess Hall,

114
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,958
one of the places you probably
want to try and avoid, really.

115
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,553
What are those?

116
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,635
They're a kind of fruit

117
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,632
we collected from a planet
we visited recently.

118
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,153
May I try one?

119
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,916
I'll warn you,
most people find these rather bitter.

120
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,713
Most people spit them right back out.

121
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,918
This is the first food I've been
able to feed myself since I was nine.

122
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,109
T.J., this is Young.
Have you seen Rush?

123
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,872
He turned his damn radio off.

124
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,675
I think I've gotten you in trouble.

125
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,915
They're on their way now, sir.

126
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,757
- I took my vacation time.
- All of it?

127
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,798
Yeah. We have a lot of lost time
to make up for.

128
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,195
You got rid of the ugly chair.

129
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,429
Yeah.

130
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,956
You can do better than that.

131
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,196
Five or six percent would do it.

132
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,429
That's the thought.

133
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,078
The problem is how to do that

134
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,594
without any access
to the ship's core systems.

135
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,037
Or for that matter, any knowledge of
how they work in the first place.

136
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,678
I'm just saying.

137
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,115
Show her everything you've got.

138
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,634
Nicholas?

139
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,913
It's me again.

140
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,432
We came out of FTL.

141
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,869
Something's happened to the ship.

142
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,436
JOHANSEN: Okay, listen up,
I promise to get to everyone.

143
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,509
You got it? Thank you.

144
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,160
Right now, I need anyone
who has a potential head injury

145
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,754
or internal trauma to move
to the front of the line.

146
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,159
Don't be shy.

147
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,389
GREER: T.J.!

148
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,837
- Hey.
- Put us to work.

149
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,797
Anyone who's shaky,
don't take any chances.

150
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,639
The quiet ones could be
in the worst shape.

151
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,199
What about you?

152
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,154
I'm fine. Go.

153
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,152
Are we under attack or not?

154
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,310
No. It was a malfunction.

155
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,955
VOLKER: He's right, there's no sign of
any hostile ships in range.

156
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,029
Not that I can tell, anyway.

157
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,155
What the hell just happened, then?

158
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,152
I think there was an explosion
in the FTL drive.

159
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,832
- We're adrift.
- Why?

160
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,070
- VOLKER: An overload?
- It could be anything.

161
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,957
Can we access the engineering spaces?

162
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,553
BRODY: Not without a space suit.

163
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,993
Most of the ship's unpressurized.

164
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,150
Best to check the damage
from outside the ship.

165
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,673
I can fly a Kino pretty well.

166
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,909
YOUNG: Get to it.

167
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,675
You two monitor from here.
I'll use the stones to report this.

168
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,476
Mandy, are you sure you're all right?

169
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:04,076
For a second there,
I was back on Earth in a strange house,

170
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,639
back in my own body again.

171
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,235
The link is temporarily severed
when we go in and out of FTL.

172
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,232
I'm sorry, but we weren't
expecting that to happen.

173
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,914
I'm fine.

174
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,198
What do you remember?

175
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,999
I was walking, then I was somewhere else,

176
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,196
and I don't know how I got there.

177
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,032
Then the explosion happened.

178
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,509
So the lapse happened before?

179
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,749
Well, sometimes concussions

180
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,239
can cause short-term memory loss
and confusion.

181
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,515
We'll just keep you here tonight,
make sure it's nothing more serious.

182
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,194
T.J.! He was on the floor.

183
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,679
I couldn't tell if he was hurt or not.

184
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,035
JOHANSEN: Okay, put him over here, guys.

185
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,194
Franklin?

186
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,835
This is Volker.
Are you getting pictures?

187
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,073
Yeah, we see it.

188
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,199
SHARON: So, is there anything
I need to worry about?

189
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,398
I've been with Amanda a long time.

190
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,833
We'll need to monitor her blood pressure

191
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,399
and there's a few other things
I need to show you

192
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,790
that just come with the territory,
and she'll be fine.

193
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,478
I'm sorry, it's just, I'm new to all this.

194
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,512
You'll be fine, too.

195
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,588
- What's happening?
- Incoming wormhole.

196
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,350
This is Rush.
We have an incoming wormhole.

197
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,353
Sergeant Greer, please meet me
in the Gate Room with a defense team.

198
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,512
I need everybody out of here!

199
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,955
That won't be necessary, Sergeant.

200
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,916
- Whoa, whoa! Don't shoot!
- GREER: Stand down!

201
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,274
Told you.

202
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,673
- Oh, my brother.
- Greer!

203
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,593
I didn't expect to see you again
either, huh?

204
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,477
What do you mean,
you weren't expecting to see us?

205
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,757
Didn't you guys figure out
a way for us to dial in?

206
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,911
- I joined a book club.
- Mmm.

207
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,638
Yeah, it's supposed to be all women,

208
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,076
but there are a few enlightened
young men who stop by,

209
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,357
claim to have an interest
in 19th century chick-lit.

210
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,313
Can we concentrate on eating right now?

211
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,992
- SHARON: Sorry.
- Sorry.

212
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,429
You know what, why don't I do that?

213
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,272
Yeah, we'll be fine.

214
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,990
- One at a time.
- Got it.

215
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,073
This isn't freaking you out, is it?

216
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,674
You're here. That's all that matters.

217
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,355
Here.

218
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,190
Well, we were pretty much resigned
to the fact that we were stuck out there.

219
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,953
Talk about
feeling like a third wheel.

220
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,115
And then on the second night,
the Kino remote just lit up.

221
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,351
I guess I just thought you guys
must've figured something out.

222
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,000
We dialed back and here we are.

223
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,833
Yeah, I didn't think it was
possible to miss this bucket.

224
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,832
Do you people realize
you just scared the crap out of us?

225
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,717
- SCOTT: Sorry, sir.
- You're forgiven.

226
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,268
- So, are they going to live?
- JOHANSEN: Looks like it.

227
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,032
That planet couldn't have been
all that bad.

228
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,439
YOUNG: That's good.

229
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,431
Because if we don't get the FTL drive fixed,

230
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,317
that's where we'll all be going.

231
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,628
- Really?
- YOUNG: Really, Eli.

232
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,517
I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to
put you right back to work.

233
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,279
Welcome back.

234
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,439
JOHANSEN: How's he doing?

235
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,469
Same, but something changed
since we got stuck.

236
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,155
Doesn't he look different to you?

237
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,673
- Maybe.
- It's like he's in there,

238
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,034
and he knows exactly what's going on,

239
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,590
but his brain and his body
just aren't connected anymore.

240
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,199
I don't know.

241
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,909
I talked to Rush, and he says
I'm probably just imagining it.

242
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,879
Maybe I am.

243
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,270
I mean, I haven't slept in...
I don't even know.

244
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,670
- Why?
- I keep having the same bad dream.

245
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:42,078
I am stuck in a dark room,
but I'm not me, and I can't get out.

246
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,111
Are you claustrophobic?

247
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,595
Little bit.

248
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,036
Maybe it's some weird phantom memory
from your switch with Dr. Perry.

249
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,798
Hey, Math Boy.

250
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,878
Got those calculations I was asking about?

251
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,669
Done.

252
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,635
Please don't call me that.

253
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,157
I know what that's like.

254
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,438
Nick called me "Little Miss Brilliant"
a couple of times, and it stuck.

255
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,189
Nick?

256
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,678
- Nicholas.
- Rush?

257
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,594
We were colleagues back at SGC
a couple of years before Icarus.

258
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,193
He used to like to bounce ideas off of me

259
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,398
when he was working on that
Ancient proof that you ended up solving.

260
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,629
Congratulations, by the way.

261
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,630
- Look where it got me.
- I would do anything to be here.

262
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,516
Anyway, after Nick's wife passed away,

263
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,072
we used to have these long talks
about his work and my work,

264
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,791
the Ancients, Ascension.

265
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,240
It was like he didn't even see the chair.

266
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,356
I tried calling him "Mr. Brilliant"
a few times,

267
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,113
but I don't think he ever got the hint.

268
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,949
You had a thing? For him?

269
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,629
What's wrong with that?

270
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,311
I just find it kind of surprising.

271
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,472
Why, because a disabled person
can't have feelings for someone?

272
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,916
I meant because you were
talking about him.

273
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,275
Yeah.

274
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,918
Thanks for this.

275
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,994
Sure.

276
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,229
Rush?

277
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,109
You've got something?

278
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,510
RUSH: Well, Dr. Perry's concluded that
the explosion may be to our advantage.

279
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,589
How?

280
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,314
There was an overload.

281
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,277
One that probably
shouldn't have happened

282
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,078
because the system is unbelievably robust,

283
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,673
with more safeguards than I can count,

284
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,557
but it happened,

285
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,712
and as with most overloads,
it happened in the weakest link.

286
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,360
ELI: The FTL drive is made up of
16 separate modules.

287
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,317
The one that blew up was the weakest link

288
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,719
because it was the least efficient.

289
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,597
So the ship can fly on the other drives?

290
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,432
RUSH: Even better than that.

291
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,274
Without the worn-out drive
bringing down overall efficiency,

292
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,999
Destiny should be able
to make it across the void.

293
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,559
That's great work.

294
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,278
I wouldn't pat anyone on the back just yet.

295
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,669
We still need to isolate
and bypass the damage.

296
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,479
With no access to the core systems,
it has to be done manually.

297
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,437
- Or...
- Or what?

298
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,832
The robot we found.

299
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,915
We think it might be able to do some,
or maybe all, of the repairs.

300
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,118
I've already programmed rudimentary
instructions to begin the repairs.

301
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,435
Scott, this is Young.

302
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,954
Eli and Dr. Perry have a shuttle mission
to brief you on.

303
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,951
Copy that, sir. On my way.

304
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,512
What are the odds?

305
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,830
That this is going to work?

306
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,354
Fair to middling. Time's an issue.

307
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,397
There is another option.

308
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,436
Right, the chair.

309
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,589
Well, if we can gain access
to the core systems,

310
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,638
we can bypass that damaged section
in a single command.

311
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,517
Tell you what, if it comes right down to it,

312
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,670
I'll sit in the thing myself.

313
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,596
SCOTT: Getting into position now.

314
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,192
Opening rear hatch.

315
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,278
Okay, we're good.

316
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,193
Here we go.

317
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,434
Come in.

318
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,953
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

319
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,630
I'd like permission to join the team
going through the stargate to the planet.

320
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,199
Scott's going.

321
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,795
He's a little busy flying
the shuttle right now.

322
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,030
He's already on his way back.

323
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,269
So, is this how it's going to be?

324
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,079
Maybe I'd like to see the planet
where I might have to raise our child.

325
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,958
You mean if the ship isn't fixed by then?

326
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,320
Yeah. Maternal instincts, I guess.

327
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,912
Okay. Permission granted.

328
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,673
Thanks.

329
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,876
- T.J...
- I'll be careful.

330
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,957
Lieutenant Scott found fresh water
due east of the stargate.

331
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,632
That'll be your first stop.

332
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,756
We should check out
as much land as possible

333
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,479
in case we end up having to live there.

334
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,148
Send it.

335
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,189
You know, we just came from there.

336
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,910
- This is a waste of time.
- It's standard procedure, Eli.

337
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,709
If you ask me, sometimes
you military people are a little too...

338
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,119
Holy crap!

339
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,231
- Did you see that?
- YOUNG: I saw.

340
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,998
Shut it down.

341
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,149
Looks like they found your camp.

342
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,630
- Can they get through the stargate?
- Not without a remote.

343
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,551
Lucky we weren't still there,
or else they'd have one.

344
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,676
Either way, we're cut off.

345
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,391
We have to fix the ship.

346
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:31,031
I've had my frustrations
about the pains of daily life

347
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:37,275
I've tasted degradation
and found the lace and candlelight

348
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:43,629
But we have the weights, we have
the measures of our days and nights

349
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,635
I've had my frustrations
but now I've found my place

350
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,518
And you will make it

351
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,510
But only if you run

352
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,358
Only if you run

353
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,072
You will make it

354
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,473
Only if you run

355
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,316
These lonely dedications I've found
they bring me peace and light

356
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,599
When three-fold applications
of doubt surround my fate

357
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,194
You might say we have the weights

358
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,909
We have to wage an assault on what it is

359
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:40,392
'Cause harmless medications abound
and you're not sick

360
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,038
You will make it

361
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,358
But only if you run

362
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,673
Only if you run

363
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,798
Only if you run

364
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,991
You know,
I could just go to the corner store.

365
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,435
We need a decent grocery shopping.

366
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,509
We're almost out of everything.

367
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,198
Okay. I shouldn't be long. I'll be right back.

368
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,918
I could've gone.

369
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,028
I want her to get out of the house.

370
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,755
Even if it's just for an hour.

371
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,710
Well, that's it. You've done it.

372
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,552
That isolates the drive.

373
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,312
Well, that was the easy part.

374
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,392
We'll start on the bypass
in the morning, eh?

375
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,597
You guys don't do much for fun
around here, do you?

376
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,432
- Well, there is Mr. Brody's still.
- You have a still?

377
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,399
Come and see.

378
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,473
So I'm in a room, but I'm not me.

379
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,279
What do you see?

380
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,909
Nothing. Blackness,
but I know that I am not alone.

381
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,951
What if it isn't a dream?

382
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,231
RUSH: Thank you, Mr. Brody.
BRODY: Cheers.

383
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,515
- Thanks.
- Now, be careful.

384
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,398
This stuff has only one redeeming quality.

385
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,794
Wow.

386
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,075
We make do with what we have, right?

387
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,434
- Yeah.
- Oh...

388
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,719
Speaking of, how are you managing
without your coffee?

389
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,678
Well, I must admit,

390
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,638
that's been one of the most difficult
things about being stuck up here.

391
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,278
Well, the hardships.

392
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,796
I think "insanity" is the proper word.
There and back again.

393
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,074
I've even had dreams about the stuff.

394
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,039
Well, for years after my accident,
I had dreams that I could walk.

395
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,278
- Yeah. No, I remember you telling me that.
- Mmm.

396
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,115
And then I get to do this,
and it's all happening.

397
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,511
- God, it's like a dream come true.
- Yeah.

398
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,075
- But we have to fix your ship.
- We do.

399
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,310
And then I'll have to wake up.

400
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,515
JAMES: Sir?

401
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,555
Yeah?

402
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,313
I think...

403
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,593
I think I was the one
who damaged the ship.

404
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,549
PERRY: I'm starting to notice that
redeeming quality you were talking about.

405
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,995
RUSH: You'll have to ask yourself
if it was worth it in the morning.

406
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,070
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

407
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,748
After your wife passed away,

408
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,308
and we'd have those long talks,

409
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,832
did you have any clue how I felt about you?

410
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,631
I thought you felt sorry for me.

411
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,313
I guess I thought
the same about you at first.

412
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,312
I thought you were absolutely brilliant.
Remember, I used to call you

413
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,075
- "Little Miss Brilliant..."
- Yeah. We could just forget about that.

414
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,675
I could never be sorry about that.

415
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,278
Yeah. Good night.

416
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,518
- Nick?
- Yeah?

417
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,511
Would you like to come in?

418
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,434
Yeah.

419
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,799
Look, I'm sorry, darling.
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

420
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,916
- Why?
- I just... I can't do this.

421
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,592
Nick, it's me.

422
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,879
I think we both know it's a bit
more complicated than that.

423
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,349
- The word is "insane."
- Yeah.

424
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,911
But this is also
a once-in-a-lifetime chance for me.

425
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:54,073
Mandy, you know,
probably better than anyone,

426
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,800
how I was when Gloria passed away.

427
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,677
I recently experienced something that
made me go through it all again.

428
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,352
More than a dream.

429
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,515
As real as this is to you now.

430
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:18,229
And I can tell myself
that it's been years all I like,

431
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,319
but in my heart,

432
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,951
it's just happened again.

433
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,715
Well, at least this time I can do this.

434
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,959
Oh, sorry, I...

435
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,719
What is it?

436
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,112
The Colonel needs to see you
in the Interface Room right away.

437
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,714
- Both of you.
- Is everything all right?

438
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,468
No. It's about to hit the fan again.

439
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,072
Come on. Let's go.

440
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,232
- You were gone for hours!
- I know. I'm sorry.

441
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,113
I locked my keys in the car.

442
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,873
I thought you had gotten into an accident.

443
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,428
I imagined you being taken away
by an ambulance!

444
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,956
No. No, no, no, no.
Oh, God, Camile, I'm sorry.

445
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,157
- My imagination just went...
- Hey, hey, hey.

446
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,559
I know what it's like to wait for
someone you love to come home.

447
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,559
I'm here now.

448
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,117
- I know. I know.
- Okay.

449
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,553
Mary? Mary! Mary! Mary!
I don't know what's happening.

450
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,031
Okay, okay. I'm just going to elevate
her legs above her heart to stabilize her.

451
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,838
You're doing fine, just try and stay calm.

452
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,195
We were just talking, and then she...

453
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,508
I don't know.

454
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,319
- What's going on?
- She's going to be okay.

455
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,311
Lieutenant James left the comm room

456
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,437
without wiping her imprint off
of the stone.

457
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,875
It got knocked off the table,
and nobody noticed.

458
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,632
We think that in that opportunity,

459
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,551
an alien might have taken advantage,
used the stones,

460
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,676
and sabotaged our FTL drive.

461
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,834
JOHANSEN: She told me she blacked out
around the time of the explosion.

462
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,559
I thought it was
post-concussion syndrome.

463
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,435
RUSH: Well, mystery solved.

464
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,832
I don't see how it changes anything.

465
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,512
What part don't you get?

466
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,158
They know we're out here.

467
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,639
Yeah, they already did.

468
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,709
Without a tracking device,

469
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,997
there's no way of them knowing
where we've dropped out of FTL.

470
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,311
Yeah, he's right.
The void is unimaginably huge.

471
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,108
They can't know our location.

472
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,637
Unless the alien who took over
James' body managed to broadcast it.

473
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,435
Like a subspace message, you mean.

474
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,751
Or the alien figured out our position
before the explosion

475
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,990
and took it back with them.

476
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,389
- How would it know how...
- They sabotaged the ship.

477
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,710
How did they know how to do that?

478
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,153
RUSH: He's right.

479
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,712
That's it, then.

480
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,433
They're coming.

481
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,519
I'm so sorry.

482
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,111
Don't be silly. I brought this on myself.

483
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,000
- PETERSON: Forgive the intrusion.
- Come on in.

484
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,953
Colonel Young
just used the stones to report.

485
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,712
There's a strong possibility that Dr. Perry

486
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,995
may have to return to her body
in the next several hours.

487
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,036
We think it's best if she returns
to an Air Force facility.

488
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,553
We'll say our goodbyes.

489
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,232
I'll wait outside.

490
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,074
Let's go.

491
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,999
This is Young.

492
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,709
While repairs to the ship
are still days from being complete,

493
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,233
despite our best efforts,

494
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,357
we believe an attack will happen
at any moment.

495
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,351
Shields will not withstand
a sustained bombardment,

496
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,637
and this time,
we will not be able to jump to FTL.

497
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,752
Neither can we escape
through the stargate.

498
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,990
Lieutenant Scott will be in charge
of our ship's defenses.

499
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,594
Follow his orders as you would mine.

500
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,552
If boarded, Sergeant Greer
will coordinate the strike teams,

501
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,153
but everyone will have to
join in our defense.

502
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,590
We'll give them a good fight.

503
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,713
When the time comes, don't wait too long.

504
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,153
It'll be okay.

505
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,633
I want you there to talk me through it.

506
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,875
This is all my fault. I panicked.

507
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,279
The chair...

508
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,914
ELI: They're here, sir.

509
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,592
Tell me what to do.

510
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,877
We've managed to isolate
the damaged module from the rest.

511
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,110
You have to command the ship to
enter FTL on the remaining drives.

512
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,270
How the hell do I do that?

513
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,113
Well, first you have to sit in the chair.

514
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,755
Wait!

515
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,832
Dr. Franklin just spoke.
Something about the chair.

516
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,512
What about it?

517
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,989
That's it. That's all he said.
But I think he knows what's going on,

518
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,832
and I think he was trying to say
that it should be him.

519
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,069
You can't possibly know that.

520
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,559
Well, no, sir, but I really think that...

521
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,518
We're under attack. I'm going to do this.

522
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,589
No, wait a minute. She might be right.

523
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,432
I can't ask a man to sacrifice his life, Rush.

524
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,078
RUSH: Franklin's already
been through the process.

525
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,229
His brain will have had time to heal...

526
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,515
- We don't have time for this!
- Which is exactly why

527
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,956
it should be him and not you.
At least give him the choice.

528
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,153
Dr. Franklin.

529
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,438
Dr. Franklin,

530
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,352
this ship is under attack.

531
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,672
If someone doesn't go back and
sit in the chair and help with repairs,

532
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,069
then the ship's going to be taken.

533
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,996
We're all going to be taken.

534
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,035
Do you understand
what we are asking you to do?

535
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,117
Concentrate your fire
on the smallest ships.

536
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,589
They're going to try and board us.

537
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,068
- Go back to your team.
- Yes, sir.

538
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,194
- The temperature's dropping fast.
- Any idea why?

539
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,748
I don't know. This is something new.

540
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,514
Go.

541
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,317
Something's happening.

542
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,877
- Sergeant, keep an eye on that door.
- Yes, sir.

543
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,791
Damn it! Greer?

544
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,633
We're about to be boarded
right on top of your position.

545
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,039
Copy that.

546
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,034
- Colonel? I thought you were...
- The FTL drive is powering up.

547
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,515
Does this mean you fixed the ship?

548
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,749
Camile?

549
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,558
No, it's me again.

550
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,957
Don't you hate that?

551
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,112
What's our status?

552
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,874
The damaged section of the ship
has been bypassed.

553
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,599
The FTL drive has increased efficiency.

554
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,753
It's a bit early to say, but it looks like
we're going to make it across.

555
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,594
We did it.

556
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,190
Yes, we did, and now it's time to go.

557
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,718
It's not a very nice thing to say,
but I do hope you need my help again.

558
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,832
Well, I'm not above arranging that,
you know.

559
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,959
Bye, Mandy.

560
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,954
Bye, Nick.

561
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,428
Nicholas?

562
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,231
Welcome back, Camile.

563
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,469
YOUNG: Anything happen?

564
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,949
You'd know better than I would, sir.
I was watching a closed door.

565
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,315
- Did it stay closed?
- Yes, sir.
