00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:05,834
RUSH: Destiny.
The design is clearly Ancient.

2
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,430
Launched hundreds of thousands
of years ago.

3
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:09,735
SCOTT: Where the hell are we?

4
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,970
Several billion light years from home.

5
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:16,071
We are on a ship, but we have no idea
where we are in relation to Earth.

6
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:19,982
RUSH: This ship could be the most
important discovery mankind has made

7
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:21,417
since the stargate itself.

8
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,751
YOUNG: These are the wrong people
in the wrong place.

9
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,688
SCOTT: I've got a lot of wounded.
We need to get home.

10
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:28,522
RUSH: We barely have enough power
to operate the main systems.

11
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:31,927
This ship simply doesn't have
the capability to dial Earth.

12
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,625
Even if we can get
the life support working,

13
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:36,964
- we don't have much food and water.
- Then go get some.

14
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,935
Little boys playing soldier.

15
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,597
Well, I'm sorry.
I've no interest in playing your game.

16
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,674
I'm not playing anything.

17
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,539
I'm trying to save the lives
of everyone aboard that ship.

18
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,511
We do have power issues to be aware of.

19
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:52,218
If I wasn't being clear,
I was giving you an order.

20
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:52,274
If I wasn't being clear,
I was giving you an order.

21
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,784
Dr. Rush.

22
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:35,054
- Dr. Rush, I was wondering if...
- Not now!

23
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:49,101
What are you doing?

24
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,143
Morning.
Colonel Young asked us to figure out...

25
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:54,338
I turned these systems off for a reason.
They need to stay off!

26
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:14,860
BRODY: Don't know whether the ship
has electrolyzed it to produce oxygen,

27
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,937
but you can see
there's not much left in there.

28
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:20,005
We did some calculations
based on our estimates

29
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:21,698
of the water depth and tank dimensions.

30
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,299
- And the winner is?
- Just over 90, 000 liters.

31
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,641
91, 046. Ish.

32
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,245
Go, Math Boy.

33
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,385
- Sounds like a lot.
- It wouldn't fill a backyard swimming pool.

34
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,614
Still, it's enough to loosen
the rationing restrictions, isn't it?

35
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,691
Camile, I think I know
where you're going with this,

36
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,555
and believe me when I say
that I, too, could use a shower.

37
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:45,553
I don't think the showers use water.

38
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,568
They just spray a sort of mist
that you kind of stand in,

39
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,660
and it sort of beads up.

40
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:53,765
There's one in a compartment
off the crew quarters.

41
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:56,000
How do you know all that
if you haven't tried it?

42
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,167
How do you know I haven't tried it?

43
00:02:58,645 --> 00:02:59,839
Oh, we know.

44
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,709
Thank you, Lieutenant Rose Garden.

45
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:06,216
No, he's right. You're worse than he is.

46
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,310
Wow, you can tell them apart?

47
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,887
We also identified a recycling system
for liquid waste,

48
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:15,654
so once we get that system
up and running...

49
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:22,757
Okay, folks, let's have a better day
than yesterday. Thank you.

50
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,473
- Your ration, sir.
- Thank you.

51
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,639
I ordered you here 20 minutes ago.

52
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,411
I've been working.

53
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,411
Throughout the night, actually,

54
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,451
trying to find out
why our power reserves are so low.

55
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,082
I'm quite concerned, and so should you be.

56
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:49,252
Okay, well, how bad is it?

57
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,326
I haven't been able to access any
of the main systems yet, so I don't know.

58
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,425
You look exhausted.
Maybe you should take a break.

59
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:57,628
Get the information we need

60
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,637
and make some informed decisions,
and we report...

61
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,706
Could you please stop people
running around

62
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,611
activating every bloody system
they can get their hands on?

63
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:10,944
I will.

64
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,249
That was delicious. Thank you very much.

65
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:23,560
That man is a lot of work.
Let's bring in the next group, please.

66
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,128
Doctor, I'm very sorry to bother you.

67
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:35,639
I know you're busy, but I really need your...

68
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,675
What did I say?

69
00:04:58,197 --> 00:04:59,994
Come on, it doesn't have to be profound.

70
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:03,068
Just who you are
and something you want to say.

71
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:06,570
Like... Hi, I'm Eli Wallace.

72
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:10,700
I'm 25 years old.
I'm currently unemployed,

73
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,906
and just for posterity's sake,
I'd like to say,

74
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:20,111
"Take your stinking paws off me,
you damn dirty ape! " for example.

75
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:24,679
I'm not really gonna say that.
Just try it. Say something.

76
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,627
YOUNG: Well, it could be that Rush is
just starting a fire so he can put it out,

77
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:39,705
or it could be that he's so far ahead of us

78
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,104
he can see problems
that none of us can see.

79
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,466
So what do you want us to do?

80
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:46,441
Help him.

81
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,605
The man likes to work alone.

82
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:51,479
Well, with the way he's been treated,
you can hardly blame him.

83
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:53,108
I can blame him all day long.

84
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:55,119
It's pretty hard not to, considering.

85
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:58,520
- This isn't helpful.
- Yeah, well, it's the truth.

86
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,819
YOUNG: Well, we're stuck
with Rush for now.

87
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,990
Scott is checking out the other shuttle,
seeing if it's operational.

88
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:07,658
He asked that you two join him
when we were done here, so off you go.

89
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,499
Dismissed.

90
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:15,763
Please tell me that's everyone.

91
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,538
We still have the question of what to do
with the Senator's body.

92
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,408
Yeah, we'll get to him.
He's not going anywhere.

93
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,608
I'd appreciate a file on everyone
by sometime tomorrow.

94
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,275
Nothing fancy.

95
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,216
- And my assignment, sir?
- Recipes, Becker.

96
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,454
For the love of God, recipes.

97
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:42,027
Second Lieutenant Vanessa James, 26,
Air Force Special Forces.

98
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,934
All I have to say is,

99
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,840
I don't want to die out here.

100
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:56,842
WRAY: Colonel!

101
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,041
YOUNG: I thought we were done.

102
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:01,484
There are still dozens of human resources
issues we need to talk about.

103
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,952
Pick one.

104
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:06,047
The matter of Lieutenant Johansen
resigning her commission.

105
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,127
Consider her reactivated.

106
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:10,718
- Well, I don't know if that's up to...
- Up to me? Yeah, it is.

107
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,422
We need a medic.

108
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:15,926
I don't even know why she resigned
in the first place.

109
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,832
Well, that's none of my business.

110
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:25,070
Colonel, look what we figured out.
We're calling it a recharging plate.

111
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,735
YOUNG: Uh-huh.

112
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:29,610
We've tweaked it so it works
with Earth technology.

113
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:30,704
For now, we have to be careful

114
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,945
not to leave them on the plate for too long
or it fries the battery, but...

115
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:37,546
- Not bad, huh?
- It's great.

116
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:38,988
- Isn't it?
- Turn it off.

117
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:42,119
- Why?
- Well, Rush says we have power issues.

118
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,354
We've got all these things to recharge.

119
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,432
I know, but as soon as he gives
the go-ahead, you kids can go crazy.

120
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:49,831
For now, help me pass the word
to stop pushing buttons.

121
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,579
It's cool, guys. This one's secure.

122
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,779
JOHANSEN: You think you can
fly this thing, man?

123
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,348
I can fly an F-302.

124
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,286
GREER: Yeah, in a simulator.

125
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,424
This is a real spaceship, man.

126
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,693
Yes, it is.

127
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:22,060
So, pretty screwed up, huh?

128
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:25,597
Yeah.

129
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,997
Yeah, pretty screwed up.

130
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,766
You think they're gonna work it out?

131
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:34,040
We're pretty freaking far from home, man.
I don't know.

132
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,204
Not today.

133
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:40,013
You should have shipped out
weeks ago, T.J.

134
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:42,781
- It's not right.
- It ain't right at all.

135
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:48,186
Yeah, well, I'm here,
so what do you want us to do?

136
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,286
Help me figure out
what kind of bird we got here.

137
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:56,027
I just radioed Brody to come down,
help translate the controls.

138
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:59,902
Took me half an hour
just to find the "On" switch.

139
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:03,573
Maybe we can take a little joyride, huh?

140
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:04,973
Oh, joy!

141
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:13,584
You don't have to follow me around.

142
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:14,710
What do you mean?

143
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,549
I mean that I'm okay.

144
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,848
Oh. Thank God you said something,

145
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,255
'cause I thought you were
following me around,

146
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,224
and it was about to get awkward.

147
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,088
I don't mind the company.

148
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:28,996
I just don't want to keep you
from anything important.

149
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,998
I am done with important.
I'm taking the day off from important.

150
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:33,537
- You should.
- So should you.

151
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,936
Me?

152
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:38,709
I don't even know what to do
with myself, Eli.

153
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,143
I'm the last person who should be here.

154
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,341
- I'm second to last.
- You're underestimating yourself.

155
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,283
So are you.

156
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:52,751
Can you show me how to use that shower
you were talking about?

157
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:55,258
Yes. Yes, I can.

158
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:01,565
YOUNG: Scott's checking out the shuttle,
seeing if it's operational.

159
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:04,568
Everyone else is holding the work
until you give the green light.

160
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,069
Thank you.

161
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,406
Look, I want you to know
that I'm well aware

162
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:13,410
that in the field of Ancient technology,

163
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:15,139
or pretty much any other subject
I can think of,

164
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:16,612
you're the best I've got.

165
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,617
But we can't be working at cross purposes.

166
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,212
All I ask is that you check with me
before issuing orders.

167
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:27,588
Check with you?
No, no, you see, you got it backwards.

168
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:30,093
If you're doing something,
I want to know what it is,

169
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,322
and this is not a request.

170
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,795
Done. Fine. I'll tell you everything.

171
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:35,662
If there is an issue that affects
everybody on this ship,

172
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:37,998
like we're running out of power.

173
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:39,128
I think I already told you that.

174
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:42,105
I'm not here to snap your back
or piss you off,

175
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,142
but if we're going to be on this ship
for any length of time,

176
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,512
we need to be on the same page.

177
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:49,946
I think our length of time
together on Destiny

178
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,246
may be shorter than you think.

179
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,642
Okay.

180
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:57,086
I get it. Who can I bring in to help?

181
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,623
Honestly, it may take
longer than we've got

182
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,886
to bring someone else up to speed.

183
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,292
- Volker it is.
- Perfect, terrific.

184
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,994
You can tell him to sit on his hands
if you want to.

185
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,666
Spencer, Sergeant. I'm 31.

186
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:21,947
All I want to say is, I never asked for this.

187
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:27,214
All I want is to get off this ship.

188
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,892
ELI: What's it feel like?

189
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,154
What?

190
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:39,865
What's it feel like on your bare skin?

191
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:42,433
- It's really warm!
- Yeah?

192
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,525
- JAMES: Eli.
- I'm just standing guard!

193
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:47,231
Anybody could walk in. I... What?

194
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,103
- Whatever. I need to talk to you.
- I'm...

195
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,307
Alone. It's important.

196
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,145
Wow, I am so torn.

197
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:03,044
Chloe, I'm gonna take Eli for a minute.
That all right with you?

198
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:04,213
Okay!

199
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,859
I'll check back with you later, okay?

200
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:12,990
Okay!

201
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:23,404
Hey, heard you could use a helper.

202
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,409
Well, you heard wrong.

203
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:28,036
Yeah, Young said not to take no
for an answer.

204
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:31,014
RUSH: If he wanted to be helpful,
he would have sent Eli instead.

205
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:34,177
Well, thank you for that,
but Eli's a kid, really,

206
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:35,583
- and I'm an astrophysicist, so...
- Mr. Volker,

207
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,816
I neither need nor want your help,
all right?

208
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:45,093
Look, he's just going to drag me right
back in here, and you know it.

209
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:46,357
Come on.

210
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:49,866
Right, I'm concerned that Destiny
is on the verge of losing power.

211
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,334
Look for yourself.

212
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,736
This ship's been flying around
for the better part of a million years.

213
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,103
I know.

214
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,302
So I don't understand why
all of a sudden...

215
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:03,040
Well, we showed up and started
doing things, how about that?

216
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,515
- Like what?
- Dialing back to Earth, for one!

217
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,142
Come on, we had to try.

218
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,755
Look out a window, man.
We're flying faster than the speed of light.

219
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,381
How close to the end of the rope
can we be?

220
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:16,427
You're obviously not capable
of seeing the signs.

221
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:22,260
Okay, well, speaking of signs,
when was the last time you slept?

222
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,063
Look, if you know what you're looking for,

223
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,502
there are clear indications that power
is being channeled

224
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:27,697
into life support and away from...

225
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,865
How can you know that?

226
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,839
We're still completely locked out
of the core systems.

227
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,001
Out!

228
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,875
- Okay, I'll... Forget I said anything.
- Now!

229
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,414
- No, I'll just work quietly...
- It's too bloody late for that, isn't it?

230
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:41,213
I told him you'd be a waste of time!
A waste of time that we can ill afford!

231
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,481
If you can't see the signs
staring you in the face,

232
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,489
then you're no good to me! Get out!

233
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,276
Look, we just want to talk.

234
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:16,755
You said "alone."

235
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,915
Well, how else was I supposed
to get you out of there?

236
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,116
What's going on, Eli?

237
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:24,422
- You mean right now?
- Don't be an idiot.

238
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,931
Wow, you must be getting to know me,
because I respond really well to that.

239
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,694
We can't get a straight answer
from anybody

240
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,430
about whether or not we're going
to make it back to Earth.

241
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,199
I don't think anybody knows.

242
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,604
JAMES: They don't know or won't tell us?

243
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,109
I'm pretty sure if they knew,
they would tell you.

244
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,070
They'd tell you.

245
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:43,875
Me?

246
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,949
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, we are, Eli.

247
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:52,352
You're on the inside. Rush needs you.

248
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,516
The Colonel's looking out for you.

249
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,924
Okay, tell you what,

250
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,564
if they tell me, then I'll tell you.

251
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,697
That's all we ask.

252
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,202
That's it?

253
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,505
Great. This has been good.

254
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,972
I think as a group, we've bonded.

255
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,951
- You got to be kidding me.
- I know.

256
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:24,115
You were in there five minutes.

257
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,020
He kicked me out.

258
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,685
What's the matter with you?
You're a grown man.

259
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:31,426
I know that, but he said, "Out!"

260
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,758
Well, what the hell did you say
to the man?

261
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:35,231
I didn't say anything! I was trying
to figure out what his problem was.

262
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:39,532
It's our problem, Volker. It's not just his.
I need you to get your ass back in there.

263
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:42,505
- I'm telling you, he's gone crazy.
- Well, we already knew that. Go.

264
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,441
This isn't the old crazy.
This is a whole new crazy.

265
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:46,875
Would you like me to hold your hand,
is that it?

266
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,571
Is that what you need me to do?

267
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,842
- Come on, Colonel, I'm trying.
- All right.

268
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,242
Here we go. Let's do this.

269
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,911
I'll take you there myself.
And for God's sake, Volker,

270
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,453
if you people can't stand up
to the son of a bitch...

271
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,271
YOUNG: Did you do that, Rush?

272
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,746
Is that what you think? No.

273
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:31,088
No, I didn't, but I have been standing here
for the past few minutes

274
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,591
watching systems fail all over the ship,

275
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:37,560
and there's nothing
that I could do to stop that.

276
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:40,088
The FTL drive was amongst the last to go.

277
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,791
We could be in range of a stargate.

278
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:48,165
You see what I mean?
No, there's no countdown.

279
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:53,407
There's got to be emergency reserves.

280
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:57,073
I don't think you seem to understand
what's going on here, Colonel.

281
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,707
Our reserves are gone.

282
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,784
All of our power is gone.

283
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,563
Uh, Dr. Dale Volker. I'm 34 years old,

284
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:17,067
and despite what you may
or may not have heard

285
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:20,434
from a certain Scottish person,

286
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,706
I like to think that
I'm a pretty fine astrophysicist.

287
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,238
I mean, they don't send you to work
on solving the mysteries of the universe

288
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,837
on other planets if you're a hack, right?

289
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:33,315
So, that's all I have to say.

290
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,781
And we can't all be Mozarts, right?

291
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,552
Some of us are Salieris.

292
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:46,160
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
I like Salieri.

293
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,859
I find his music is...

294
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:54,064
It's... It's soothing. I'm not suggesting
that he's Mozart, either.

295
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,069
Although Mozart did go a little nuts,
didn't he?

296
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:04,045
All right, I'm done.
He's maybe a Schubert at best.

297
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:07,718
Or an Elgar.

298
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:11,211
I'm done, Eli.

299
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,192
FRANKLIN: Hey, the lights went off
in my compartment.

300
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,196
- Yeah, it's the same all over.
- FRANKLIN: Well, why?

301
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,061
Why does everybody think
that I know everything?

302
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,566
CHLOE: Eli! Eli!

303
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:27,499
Eli! Eli!

304
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,471
ELI: Chloe?

305
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,967
Not funny, Eli!

306
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:34,068
It wasn't me!
We had a power failure or something.

307
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:37,114
- I was on my way to go...
- Well, I'm freezing, and I can't see!

308
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:41,645
Wait. Hold on. Here, let me help.

309
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,952
Oh! Sorry! Sorry.

310
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,949
Everything just stopped
and went pitch black.

311
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,925
I completely freaked.

312
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,019
Yeah, we heard.

313
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:56,557
- How was the shower?
- It's fine. Thanks for asking.

314
00:18:57,402 --> 00:19:00,530
Look, just go find out what's going on.
I'm okay.

315
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,001
Here, here. It's something, anyway.

316
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:07,204
- Don't make any long distance phone calls.
- Thanks.

317
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,739
- Eli?
- Yeah!

318
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,748
Wait for me?

319
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,014
Sure.

320
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,517
- Turn around.
- Sure.

321
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,325
YOUNG: So it wasn't anything you did?

322
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:31,163
Since I arrived, I have been unable
to access any of the core systems,

323
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,500
power, navigation or propulsion.

324
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:34,970
Why didn't you bring
somebody else in on this?

325
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:36,904
Because I'm the only qualified person!

326
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,203
YOUNG: You see,
this is what I'm talking about.

327
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,607
VOLKER: Maybe it's like a Lantian device.

328
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:40,973
You need the Ancient gene to access the...

329
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,172
Destiny predates that technology.

330
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:44,374
You know that for a fact?

331
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:47,452
Yes, Colonel!
I know many, many things for a fact!

332
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:51,455
I know you asked Gorman to poke around
in the weapons systems, for a fact!

333
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,253
I know you have ordered teams
of people all over the ship

334
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,021
to do things that they know
nothing about, for a fact!

335
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:00,690
Right. You think all those things
add up to this, Rush?

336
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,232
Does that make sense to you?

337
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,232
Look. Look!

338
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:07,098
No, you're right. You are right.

339
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,501
It was your reckless, pointless attempt
to dial Earth

340
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:14,045
that robbed me of the time
I needed to solve this problem!

341
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:15,443
Well, maybe we're just
missing something.

342
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:19,244
Yes, the opportunity of a lifetime!
Because you wouldn't listen to me!

343
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,114
- T.J., this is Young.
- RUSH: I refuse to be held responsible

344
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,984
- for this situation!
- We could use a medic in the Gate Room.

345
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:25,147
YOUNG: Nobody's blaming you.

346
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,020
- I ran out of time!
- We can fix this.

347
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,754
Fix this? What do you think, just because
you give the order that it's possible?

348
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:32,796
There is no more power!

349
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:37,062
Destiny saved every last ounce
of its reserves for life support,

350
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:38,932
and I've seen it happening!

351
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:42,029
I've seen it being sequestered
away from me!

352
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,944
I tried to... I tried to stop it.
I tried to stop it, but I couldn't.

353
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:46,069
I tried to... I tried to stop it.
I tried to stop it, but I couldn't.

354
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,440
- Rush...
- In a few days' time,

355
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:50,447
this ship will go dark!

356
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:53,709
It will go dark and cold.

357
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:59,288
YOUNG: T.J., now.

358
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:05,887
Okay, I'm Sergeant Hunter Riley.

359
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,598
I'm one day short of my 30th birthday.

360
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:13,928
I grew up on a farm.

361
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,832
I have relatives who've never
even left the state,

362
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,912
and here I am halfway
across the universe, so...

363
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:24,512
No regrets.

364
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:35,784
YOUNG: So...

365
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:39,288
VOLKER: Rush was right.
Everything but life support is dead.

366
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:41,229
Well, why now?
Why just when we show up?

367
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,358
Because we just showed up.

368
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,264
Well, there's the stargate.

369
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,804
It's a power hog,
and we had it on all day yesterday.

370
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:51,103
There's still some power, and the shields
are still working to some degree.

371
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:54,007
- Again, that's to keep us alive.
- For how long?

372
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,873
We're gonna have to wait for Rush
to wake up for an answer to that one.

373
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,779
Well, T.J. says he's not going to be up
for a while.

374
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,853
So where does that leave us?

375
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,289
- Dead.
- Dead.

376
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,126
Not right away.

377
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:09,750
VOLKER: Yeah, we have days,
maybe a lot of days,

378
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:11,385
but if there's no stargate in range...

379
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,656
And there's not.

380
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,254
We don't have the power
to dial out anyway.

381
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:17,563
So it's a race between food, water
and life support.

382
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,636
I don't buy that.

383
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:21,001
We can't do anything without access
to the ship's systems.

384
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:24,041
Look. I mean, I could stand here all day.

385
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:25,967
Eli?

386
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:29,605
I put a Kino into search mode

387
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:31,649
and sent it into unpressurized
areas of the ship

388
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,446
looking for an active console somewhere.

389
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:35,781
Nothing yet.

390
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:40,324
Also, I was looking into if there's any way
we could integrate the shuttle's power

391
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:42,086
with the ship's system.

392
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,662
- So you're working the problem.
- Yeah.

393
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,736
Does the computer-hacking dropout

394
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:55,329
- have to save our asses...
- The dropout is still here.

395
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,500
...or are you going to get
your heads out of yours?

396
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:02,375
The shuttle idea is pretty good.

397
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:03,971
Yeah, there might be a work-around.

398
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:05,344
Well, let's do that.

399
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:12,412
Thank you, Eli.

400
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:16,855
By the way, it's MIT dropout.

401
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:19,029
You want a gold star for that?

402
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,663
- No, I just...
- Do something.

403
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,929
I'm going to be gone for a few hours.

404
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:27,027
- Gone?
- YOUNG: To report this mess.

405
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:28,868
If you need me, yank me back.

406
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:33,771
Wanna say hi?

407
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:35,904
Lieutenant Matthew Scott.

408
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,774
I'm 26 years old,

409
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:46,017
and I'd like to say a prayer for all of us
if that's okay.

410
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:47,785
ELI: Sure, yeah. Whatever you want.

411
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:51,159
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

412
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:56,556
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

413
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:58,158
He leadeth me to still waters.

414
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:07,205
- TELFORD: I'll take it from here, Peter.
- Again?

415
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:10,711
What can I say?
I'm a glutton for punishment.

416
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:11,908
Okay.

417
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:06,134
- TELFORD: What's going on, Sergeant?
- Actually, I was coming to ask you.

418
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:11,602
Colonel Young went back to report.
I'm Colonel Telford.

419
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,143
I'd like to speak
with Dr. Rush immediately.

420
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,838
Oh? Well, he's had
a nervous breakdown, sir.

421
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:19,842
- What?
- But I can take you to Lieutenant Scott.

422
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:21,714
He's in the shuttle.

423
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:30,250
Wow, that was quick.

424
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:34,523
It doesn't take very long to say,
"We're screwed."

425
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,927
I'm sorry, sir.
I wish there was something we could do.

426
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:44,198
There is.

427
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:03,422
I'll shout down
when she's ready to see you.

428
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:25,941
Lieutenant Tamara Johansen.

429
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:28,612
I'm a paramedic.

430
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,452
I actually quit my job a few weeks ago.

431
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:34,583
I shouldn't even be here.

432
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,762
To think I could have missed all of this.

433
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:05,580
YOUNG: Hey.

434
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:11,653
Emily.

435
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:13,391
No, don't.

436
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:17,463
I said that you could come in,
but that's all.

437
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:18,661
Okay.

438
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,168
Scott, Johansen.

439
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:57,499
A word, please.

440
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:05,577
There's no power except for the shuttle?

441
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:07,875
Sir, you already know that.

442
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,746
Matt, this is Colonel Telford.

443
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:12,581
That's right.

444
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,216
Now, would either of you two officers
care to explain how Colonel Young

445
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:17,556
managed to let things fall apart so fast?

446
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,929
There was no way of knowing
this was going to happen.

447
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,396
You're saying Rush didn't see it coming?

448
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:24,732
That's what I thought.

449
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:28,199
I want to know what's really
going on aboard this ship.

450
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,372
- It's just... It's ridiculous.
- YOUNG: It's true.

451
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,314
Let's say that it is. Why?

452
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:42,346
Why are you putting me through this?

453
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:45,548
Because I wanted to say...

454
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,060
I'm sorry.

455
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,536
I didn't choose my job over you.

456
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:08,669
It wasn't just about the job.

457
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:10,542
I know.

458
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:22,217
I love you.

459
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:50,480
I'm guessing that didn't go well.

460
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,284
Sir.

461
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,893
- How does this change anything?
- What do you mean?

462
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:06,562
Let's say that I believe all of this.

463
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:11,631
I don't really, but even if I did,
you did choose, and you chose to go.

464
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:12,801
YOUNG: I didn't choose this.

465
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:15,004
You knew there was a chance
you wouldn't be coming back.

466
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:16,546
I am coming back.

467
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,850
No. You wouldn't be here like this
to say goodbye

468
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:23,648
if you really thought there was a chance.

469
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:28,488
Listen, I'm doing everything that I can.
I'm going to do everything that I can.

470
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,087
I want nothing more than
to get back here to be with you,

471
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:33,994
and I want nothing more than
for you to be here

472
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:35,998
for me when I do get home.

473
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:40,195
I'm just saying
I don't know when that will be.

474
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:44,738
Please.

475
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:50,347
You made your choice, Everett.

476
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:56,410
And I made mine. Nothing's changed.

477
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:02,387
And I really... I really do hope
that you're going to be okay.

478
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:04,484
- Hey. Emily, listen. Please.
- Don't. Don't, please.

479
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:06,393
Emily, please. Emily.

480
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:08,422
Just let me go.

481
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,134
I gave you a direct order, Lieutenant.

482
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:22,304
Sir, I understand that you gave me
a direct order,

483
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:25,405
and I respectfully suggest
it would be a complete waste of time!

484
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:28,781
I'm telling you,
the ship came here for a reason!

485
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,853
- SCOTT: Sir?
- The ship came here for what reason?

486
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:36,057
- Colonel Young?
- Yeah, yeah.

487
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,253
What the hell was Telford
just ordering you to do?

488
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:41,730
Use the communication stones
to report that you need to be replaced.

489
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:44,160
Well, he's probably right about that.

490
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:47,397
So, the ship came here for what reason?

491
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,441
The odds of coming out of FTL

492
00:31:56,547 --> 00:32:00,039
on the outer edge of a star system
are astronomical.

493
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:05,180
Throw in the fact that there are
three potentially habitable planets,

494
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:09,590
plus a gas giant to act as a comet catcher
on the outside of the system?

495
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,093
We're talking miraculous.

496
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:15,689
So there's a chance now
that we're going to live...

497
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,430
Though our definition of "habitable"

498
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:24,565
just means the surface temperature range
allows for the presence of liquid water,

499
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:28,009
and since the primary's a red dwarf,

500
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:31,479
the planets must have
a relatively short orbital radius

501
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:32,844
just to fall within that range,

502
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:36,352
which means there's a likelihood
at least one or two of them

503
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,546
will be tidally locked,

504
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:40,385
meaning one side
will always be facing the star,

505
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:45,292
which increases the prospect of geological
instability due to tidal stresses,

506
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:46,863
and I can't stand earthquakes.

507
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:52,403
I was in one when I was 13,
and I cut both my feet on broken glass.

508
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:59,438
But it might be nice!

509
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:12,180
Hey. How are you?

510
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,259
- How did I get here?
- You're not that heavy.

511
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:23,223
You passed out for a little while.

512
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:26,396
- How long?
- About 10 hours.

513
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:30,168
It's probably the first real sleep
you've had since we arrived here.

514
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:33,270
Has anything happened?

515
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:36,609
Not since we lost power, no.
You haven't missed a thing.

516
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,906
How do you feel?

517
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,074
Embarrassed.

518
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,585
- Don't be.
- Well, you weren't there.

519
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:47,057
Your head's pounding, right?

520
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:49,490
How many cups of coffee
do you normally drink a day?

521
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:51,061
Four? Five?

522
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,288
You're in caffeine withdrawal.

523
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:55,923
So are about a dozen
other people on board.

524
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,865
It can make you pretty crazy.

525
00:33:58,503 --> 00:33:59,731
You should see the smokers.

526
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:02,738
You're looking at one.

527
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,103
Double whammy, huh?

528
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:06,844
I was going to let you sleep it off,

529
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:09,674
but the Colonel wants you
to see something, so let's go.

530
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:17,076
ELI: If you don't do one, they're not
going to know who the hell you are.

531
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,315
Eli, I have nothing to say.

532
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:20,584
ELI: People are going to find this.

533
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:23,353
They're going to want to know
who we were.

534
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,725
Look, I'll do your slate, okay?

535
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,297
This is Dr. Nicholas Rush.

536
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:30,367
He is the lead scientist
of the Icarus Project.

537
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:32,667
Now just say what you feel.

538
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,329
Come on in.

539
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,457
Orbital insertion trajectory?

540
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:05,962
That was my first thought.

541
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:09,437
I thought your first thought was
we were gonna fly into the damn thing.

542
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,169
SCOTT: But, no, sir. I'm guessing
we'll get close enough to kiss,

543
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,869
but not enough for capture.

544
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:16,276
An aerobraking maneuver?

545
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,610
Well, the math's over my head, but, yeah,

546
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:21,344
we should come out of a slingshot
somewhere in-system.

547
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:24,018
Where there are habitable planets.

548
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:28,986
- I didn't tell him.
- No, but you're all smiling.

549
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:32,087
Well, we're still too far out to know
if they're anything more than rocks,

550
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:35,688
but we found three candidates
before Big Bertha here filled up the sky.

551
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,258
So this trajectory is no accident, then.

552
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:40,803
The man's quick.
We'll know once we're clear.

553
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:43,237
That'll be in six minutes.

554
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,172
Who translated this?

555
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,878
You know it's completely backwards.

556
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:55,808
Well, pull up a chair, sir.
This'll be a show you don't want to miss.

557
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,445
YOUNG: So we're clear,
my definition of habitable

558
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:01,116
includes a sandy beach,
a tropical climate...

559
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:02,419
RUSH: There's going to be
some severe turbulence

560
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,085
when we contact the atmosphere.

561
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:07,825
I'll pass the word.

562
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:09,524
Colonel, about our previous conversation...

563
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:13,303
- Rush, no need to apologize.
- I wasn't about to.

564
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:15,998
I'm trying to explain I was suffering
from withdrawal symptoms...

565
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:18,405
Yeah, yeah, I know. I know all about it.

566
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:23,205
Lot of, lot of work.

567
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,846
Hello, there. Adam Brody is my name.

568
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:32,079
Can I start again?

569
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,721
My name's Adam Brody, as I said earlier.

570
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:39,053
- Hello...
- ELI: Cut.

571
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,897
Adam Brody, engineer.

572
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,692
I like football, and I... What?

573
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:47,896
Dude, this isn't for
a dating service.

574
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,563
Yeah, I just...
I don't know why that came out.

575
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:50,641
I'm just... I don't know why I'm so nervous.

576
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:52,504
ELI: No, no, it's all good. It's all good.

577
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:56,102
What do we got?
We have your name, we have your job.

578
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,909
What else is there?

579
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,976
- Oh, you're 40-something, so...
- Thirty-six.

580
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:06,350
ELI: Okay. We got that now.
We'll fix that in editing.

581
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,683
All that's left is
what you want to say for posterity.

582
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:15,989
I always knew I was going to die in space.

583
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:20,295
From the moment I stepped
through the stargate, I...

584
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:23,899
I mean, I didn't expect this,

585
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:28,069
but I knew something awful
was going to happen.

586
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:32,972
I just knew it.

587
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:37,943
This is Young.

588
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:40,990
We are expecting some
atmospheric turbulence in a few minutes.

589
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,788
Find a secure place
and plunk your asses down.

590
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:48,161
RILEY ON KINO: Whoa!
Don't shoot. It's me!

591
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,358
GREER: You can talk through that thing?

592
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:52,027
RILEY: Hey, I can talk through this thing!

593
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,538
- Riley asked me how to use...
- I asked him how the Kino works.

594
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:02,135
Yeah, yeah. We took a wrong turn.

595
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:05,182
I can and will kick your ass.

596
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,307
YOUNG: Let's do that later.

597
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:09,443
We're going to pass very close
to a gas giant in a few minutes.

598
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:10,986
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

599
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:13,454
We're short on radios.
Help me spread the word.

600
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:15,388
- Yes, sir.
- YOUNG: Thank you.

601
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,520
He...

602
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:20,958
YOUNG: Wrong turn, really?

603
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:25,091
You going to stick to that story?

604
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:28,872
Go, help. Now.

605
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:50,017
BRODY: Oh, my...

606
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:57,799
Ninety seconds to contact.

607
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:06,904
- Come on, come on, come on.
- I'm coming!

608
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,740
Well, we don't have much time.

609
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:11,510
You've seen planets from space.

610
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:16,150
How could you let yourself
get jaded to this stuff so fast?

611
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:19,523
I'm not jaded.
I've just got other stuff on my mind.

612
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:20,647
Oh?

613
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:24,621
Well, we're just passing through
the atmosphere of a gas giant

614
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:28,862
on the far side of the universe
in an Ancient spaceship.

615
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:31,059
I'm sure there'll be other gas giants.

616
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:33,193
Okay, okay, let's go.

617
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:41,142
Eli! Can we please slow down?

618
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:43,713
Trust me, it'll be worth it, okay?

619
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:49,013
I guess everybody had the same idea.

620
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,884
Eli, it's beautiful.

621
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:09,864
Thirty seconds to contact. Hang on.

622
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:18,076
No, no, no, I need everyone
away from the walls.

623
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:19,513
Away from the walls.

624
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,642
The turbulence could break your back.

625
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:31,192
Sit down.

626
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:32,346
Hell of a ride, huh?

627
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:34,481
Yes. Yes, it was.

628
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:38,291
Now, let's find these planets
you were talking about.

629
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:40,386
There they are, dead ahead.

630
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,433
Yes, we should be able
to analyze the atmosphere

631
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:45,161
of the nearest planet within a few hours.

632
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:47,430
- Are we clear?
- Yes, sir.

633
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:50,029
- Did you catch any of that?
- YOUNG: No, I couldn't get back in time.

634
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,165
- SCOTT: This is unbelievable.
- Lieutenant, look at this.

635
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:54,107
- SCOTT: You sure missed a great show, sir.
- Please, everyone.

636
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:55,974
Please, everyone be quiet!

637
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:58,772
Our trajectory has changed.

638
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:02,209
- Oh, no.
- JOHANSEN: Changed?

639
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:06,855
The planet has altered Destiny's course
more than we hoped.

640
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:08,925
What are you talking about, Rush?

641
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:13,891
Lieutenant,
what the hell's he talking about?
