1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,501
<i>This is what Destiny intended from
the moment it entered the star system.</i>

2
00:00:05,603 --> 00:00:08,868
<i>That ship is the best chance
we have of getting home.</i>

3
00:00:09,007 --> 00:00:11,441
- Are we done?
- We'll never be done.

4
00:00:12,377 --> 00:00:14,277
<i>You shouldn't have
left him on the planet.</i>

5
00:00:14,412 --> 00:00:15,903
<i>You think I don't know that?</i>

6
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:19,576
<i>Everyone thinks we're safe.
They think that they'll never find us again.</i>

7
00:00:19,785 --> 00:00:21,582
Why did you take
one of our people prisoner?

8
00:00:23,288 --> 00:00:24,778
<i>We're not safe, are we?</i>

9
00:00:24,923 --> 00:00:26,652
They're coming!
- Who's coming?

10
00:00:26,725 --> 00:00:28,386
<i>Lucian Alliance,
they're coming to take Destiny.</i>

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,391
<i>There's only one way
this is going to end if we wait.</i>

12
00:00:30,462 --> 00:00:31,929
<i>I'm not
surrendering this ship.</i>

13
00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:35,595
<i>I want to know how long you
plan on keeping us locked up.</i>

14
00:00:35,734 --> 00:00:37,634
What do we have to do to earn our freedom?

15
00:00:37,736 --> 00:00:39,203
Prove to me that you're not a threat.

16
00:00:39,271 --> 00:00:40,260
<i>My mom was a nurse.</i>

17
00:00:40,339 --> 00:00:43,241
<i>She got stuck by a needle trying
to restrain a junkie in the ER.</i>

18
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:44,333
<i>She got HIV.</i>

19
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:46,311
<i>Do whatever you need to do</i>

20
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,837
<i>to get yourself back home,
'cause I'm going to be here.</i>

21
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,850
What happened?
- You were shot.

22
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:57,215
There is no leg wound.
It's almost completely healed.

23
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,814
How is that possible?

24
00:00:58,892 --> 00:00:59,950
<i>I don't know.</i>

25
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:13,402
Hey. What are you doing in here?

26
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:20,813
Are you okay?

27
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:24,583
I don't know how I got here.

28
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:30,117
The last thing I remember,
I was lying down for a nap.

29
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:32,024
Sleepwalking?

30
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:36,955
I used to do it all the time as a kid.

31
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:40,493
My dad had to put an alarm
on the front door to make...

32
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:42,537
- I'll see you later.
- O...

33
00:01:44,506 --> 00:01:45,495
kay.

34
00:01:46,775 --> 00:01:47,799
<i>Seriously.</i>

35
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,977
And it's not just this one thing.
She's been acting a little odd for a while now.

36
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:56,850
You know what I'm talking about, right?
It's not just me noticing...

37
00:01:56,918 --> 00:01:59,682
No, no. You're right.
She's been acting... different.

38
00:01:59,788 --> 00:02:01,814
She's quiet and withdrawn.

39
00:02:02,091 --> 00:02:03,490
We should talk to her about it.

40
00:02:03,559 --> 00:02:06,050
I did. I mean, I tried, yesterday.

41
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,654
And?

42
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:13,065
And nothing. She wasn't in the mood.
She was too busy writing in her diary.

43
00:02:13,236 --> 00:02:14,828
She keeps a diary?

44
00:02:15,037 --> 00:02:18,200
It's kind of a therapy for her.
It's all the stress of being on the ship...

45
00:02:18,274 --> 00:02:21,107
And what about that gunshot wound
on her leg?

46
00:02:21,177 --> 00:02:22,769
No one heals that fast.

47
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:24,947
How do you explain that?

48
00:02:25,047 --> 00:02:26,309
Eli, I can't.

49
00:02:28,485 --> 00:02:31,545
You need to use the stones.
Your mother's sick.

50
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:34,118
What... Is she...

51
00:02:34,191 --> 00:02:38,127
I don't know the details. Just that
they want you to go back as soon...

52
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,348
You need to sleep, Nic.

53
00:03:03,721 --> 00:03:05,848
- Nicholas...
- Yes, yes. Soon.

54
00:03:17,602 --> 00:03:20,231
Manipulating the countdown clock is

55
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,370
complicated, to say the least.

56
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,305
So many variables tied into it.

57
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:29,040
Well, that's the problem, isn't it?

58
00:03:29,248 --> 00:03:32,115
A myriad of systems,
each as complicated as the next.

59
00:03:32,184 --> 00:03:35,642
Made worse by one man trying
to do the work of an entire crew.

60
00:03:35,721 --> 00:03:38,315
Well, for now, I just need to control
the countdown clock,

61
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:42,019
and if you are indeed the ship,
why aren't you helping me?

62
00:03:42,361 --> 00:03:44,852
What are you really hoping to gain?

63
00:03:46,398 --> 00:03:48,629
Control of the ship is key to the mission.

64
00:03:49,236 --> 00:03:51,704
<i>Dr. Rush, this is Brody. Come in.</i>

65
00:03:53,707 --> 00:03:54,799
Go ahead.

66
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:56,465
We just dropped out of FTL.

67
00:03:56,543 --> 00:03:58,443
Yes, I'm aware of that, thank you.

68
00:03:58,511 --> 00:04:00,706
<i>But again, no gates in range.</i>

69
00:04:00,814 --> 00:04:03,282
<i>And now we're banking left,
changing course again.</i>

70
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,408
It doesn't make sense.

71
00:04:07,587 --> 00:04:08,576
Dr. Rush?

72
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:12,649
<i>Dr. Rush?</i>

73
00:04:12,726 --> 00:04:15,025
Look, I'm sorry.
I can't get away right now.

74
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,960
- Where are you?
- What are you doing?

75
00:04:17,064 --> 00:04:18,258
<i>Rush, out.</i>

76
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,866
This is getting ridiculous.

77
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:22,527
Getting old, is what it is.

78
00:04:24,238 --> 00:04:26,604
She stopped taking her treatment.

79
00:04:27,241 --> 00:04:31,268
Unfortunately, her counts dropped,
dipping below 300.

80
00:04:31,712 --> 00:04:33,737
Opening the door for pneumonia.

81
00:04:33,814 --> 00:04:35,475
We've re-started the AVR therapy,

82
00:04:35,549 --> 00:04:37,744
and we're successfully
treating the pneumonia.

83
00:04:37,852 --> 00:04:41,687
Her counts have leveled off,
so physically, she's on the mend.

84
00:04:41,857 --> 00:04:44,417
But if she stops taking
her treatment again...

85
00:04:44,593 --> 00:04:45,787
Don't let her.

86
00:04:45,861 --> 00:04:48,659
- Okay, when she returns home...
- Don't release her. Keep her here.

87
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,789
We will monitor her condition closely,

88
00:04:50,866 --> 00:04:55,098
but what concerns me is she is still
clearly suffering from depression.

89
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,204
One of our psychiatrists
has been treating her,

90
00:04:57,272 --> 00:05:00,298
but hasn't made much progress,
which is why we sent for you.

91
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:04,175
Look, whether here or at home,
she has to want to get better.

92
00:05:04,446 --> 00:05:07,939
There's no room for error now.
If her counts drop below 200...

93
00:05:08,117 --> 00:05:09,846
Yeah, yeah, I know.

94
00:05:11,054 --> 00:05:12,146
AIDS.

95
00:05:14,757 --> 00:05:17,351
I'll be down the hall if you need me.

96
00:05:42,453 --> 00:05:43,477
Hi.

97
00:05:47,224 --> 00:05:48,248
I'm

98
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,426
Airman Tracy.

99
00:05:51,595 --> 00:05:54,189
I've been working with your son, Eli.

100
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,223
Is he all right?

101
00:05:56,767 --> 00:05:58,359
Yeah, he's fine.

102
00:05:58,602 --> 00:06:02,437
He really wanted to be here, but the
military, they've got him pretty tied up.

103
00:06:02,507 --> 00:06:05,874
He's doing great things, though,
working really hard.

104
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:09,071
Anyway,

105
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:13,742
he heard about you being in the hospital.

106
00:06:17,188 --> 00:06:18,849
Tell him I'm fine.

107
00:06:19,724 --> 00:06:21,385
No, but see, he...

108
00:06:22,193 --> 00:06:24,218
He knows you're not fine.

109
00:06:25,498 --> 00:06:27,659
He told me about your condition.

110
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:32,667
He heard you stopped taking your meds,
and he's really...

111
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,032
Really worried about you.

112
00:06:39,011 --> 00:06:41,241
Not enough to be here himself.

113
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:01,797
Yeah, it's me.

114
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,033
I was just checking.

115
00:07:13,647 --> 00:07:15,114
Where are we?

116
00:07:17,317 --> 00:07:18,410
What?

117
00:07:19,454 --> 00:07:21,649
You and me. Our relationship.

118
00:07:21,856 --> 00:07:23,050
I mean,

119
00:07:24,826 --> 00:07:28,557
if we had met in a different situation,
away from this ship,

120
00:07:28,696 --> 00:07:30,789
would we still be together?

121
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:33,197
Of course.

122
00:07:34,368 --> 00:07:35,767
It's just...

123
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:39,606
This is all kind of new to me,
you know?

124
00:07:39,674 --> 00:07:42,074
I've never been all that great at

125
00:07:42,577 --> 00:07:44,341
relationships and...

126
00:07:46,148 --> 00:07:49,606
I just want to make sure
that I don't mess this up.

127
00:07:50,786 --> 00:07:52,344
You've been kind of quiet lately,

128
00:07:52,421 --> 00:07:55,686
so I start wondering and thinking,
"God, she's..."

129
00:07:55,891 --> 00:07:56,983
Matt.

130
00:08:09,204 --> 00:08:11,070
Ta-da! Your favorite.

131
00:08:11,341 --> 00:08:14,310
Mmm! I am really missing your cooking.

132
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,537
Microwave's getting a lot of work, huh?

133
00:08:17,046 --> 00:08:21,483
Yeah, and take-out. Mostly take-out.
You know me. I work most nights, so,

134
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:23,243
a lot of pizza.

135
00:08:25,154 --> 00:08:26,416
Everything okay?

136
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:32,417
Of course. You're here.
Everything is perfect.

137
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,098
Mmm! It's really good.

138
00:08:46,877 --> 00:08:47,866
Go.

139
00:08:54,218 --> 00:08:55,810
You're releasing them?

140
00:08:56,387 --> 00:08:59,515
We can't keep them
locked up forever, Sergeant.

141
00:09:00,391 --> 00:09:02,689
Sir, I beg to differ.

142
00:09:02,826 --> 00:09:06,661
We're not doing it
without strings attached.

143
00:09:07,332 --> 00:09:10,790
They've been giving us intel.
The more they give, the more they get.

144
00:09:11,202 --> 00:09:12,794
The decision's made, Sergeant.

145
00:09:13,038 --> 00:09:15,734
I've put an escort
on each Lucian Alliance member,

146
00:09:15,807 --> 00:09:17,672
so it's not like they're
walking around free.

147
00:09:17,742 --> 00:09:20,768
Excuse me, Colonel? Have you seen Chloe?

148
00:09:21,746 --> 00:09:22,770
No.

149
00:09:23,415 --> 00:09:26,282
I've been searching everywhere for her.
She's gone.

150
00:09:33,492 --> 00:09:34,720
Mornin'.

151
00:09:35,962 --> 00:09:38,692
Yeah, so the clock says.

152
00:09:40,266 --> 00:09:42,700
Well, apparently it's Sunday, too.

153
00:09:45,871 --> 00:09:48,897
The colonel decided to release them
into the general population.

154
00:09:48,975 --> 00:09:50,738
We'll see how that turns out.

155
00:09:52,712 --> 00:09:53,940
Whoa!

156
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,043
Doesn't look like it's off to a good start.

157
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:59,484
- Hey! What's going on here?
- Just making conversation.

158
00:09:59,553 --> 00:10:01,248
No, no. You apologize to her.

159
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:04,254
- Why?
- Apologize!

160
00:10:04,491 --> 00:10:07,289
- All right, take it easy.
- Think you can tell me what to do?

161
00:10:07,361 --> 00:10:09,659
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- I'm not trying to...

162
00:10:11,031 --> 00:10:12,464
What the hell are you...

163
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:15,728
You don't mess with my people.

164
00:10:15,802 --> 00:10:19,636
- Just talking to the woman.
- No, see, you don't talk to anyone.

165
00:10:20,273 --> 00:10:21,638
Oh, is she yours? I didn't know.

166
00:10:24,912 --> 00:10:27,346
Put him back in the hold
till he learns some manners.

167
00:10:27,415 --> 00:10:28,575
I'm sorry, I'm not trying to...

168
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:32,142
No, no. See, the more you talk,
the longer you'll be locked up.

169
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:39,221
You okay?

170
00:10:40,695 --> 00:10:42,287
Chloe's missing.

171
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:46,058
Colonel wants us to form search teams
and look for her.

172
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,170
You work yourself to exhaustion.

173
00:10:55,044 --> 00:10:56,841
Much work to be done.

174
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,405
Lack of sleep leads to carelessness.

175
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:05,948
I needn't remind you
that two lives have already been lost.

176
00:11:15,965 --> 00:11:18,934
Colonel... I know. I'm sorry.

177
00:11:19,169 --> 00:11:22,661
- My behavior, unacceptable.
- Yeah, it was.

178
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,373
I know it's important to fit in.

179
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:31,346
To get along with your people,
and I can do this, I promise.

180
00:11:32,148 --> 00:11:33,775
We made a deal.

181
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:37,144
We give you information,
you give us freedom.

182
00:11:39,189 --> 00:11:42,125
And I intend to hold up
my end of that deal.

183
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,687
You can trust me.

184
00:11:58,209 --> 00:11:59,506
Chloe.

185
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:02,868
Chloe.

186
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,214
What are you doing in here?

187
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:14,683
<i>Lieutenant Scott,</i>

188
00:12:15,293 --> 00:12:16,760
<i>we found her.</i>

189
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:19,694
Copy that.

190
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:24,164
What are you looking for?
- My keys.

191
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:27,827
- You can't find your keys.
- No. I thought they were in my purse, but...

192
00:12:27,906 --> 00:12:30,966
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a first.

193
00:12:31,109 --> 00:12:33,839
You know, you've never misplaced
anything as long as I can...

194
00:12:33,912 --> 00:12:37,212
Are you going to
help me find them or not?

195
00:12:42,088 --> 00:12:43,077
I'm sorry.

196
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,251
It's just, I'm late, and I can't...

197
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:57,729
I was bringing the groceries in yesterday.

198
00:12:58,337 --> 00:12:59,429
Idiot.

199
00:12:59,505 --> 00:13:01,097
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

200
00:13:01,175 --> 00:13:04,008
Because anyone could've walked in here
and taken all of our things...

201
00:13:04,077 --> 00:13:05,066
Sharon.

202
00:13:09,983 --> 00:13:14,613
I'll be an hour at most, maybe two.
I'll call you if anything changes.

203
00:13:24,298 --> 00:13:25,424
Morning.

204
00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:27,364
You up for company?

205
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:29,361
Sure.

206
00:13:30,271 --> 00:13:31,863
You're looking better.

207
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,838
Doctor said you'll be
out of here in no time.

208
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,439
Why doesn't he call me?

209
00:13:38,713 --> 00:13:40,613
It's been months now. Nothing.

210
00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:42,676
It's not like him.

211
00:13:47,922 --> 00:13:49,514
Okay, okay.

212
00:13:50,758 --> 00:13:52,953
What's your favorite movie of all time?

213
00:13:53,394 --> 00:13:54,589
What?

214
00:13:54,663 --> 00:13:57,131
Just go with me on this.
Your favorite movie.

215
00:13:57,533 --> 00:13:58,727
<i>Grease.</i>

216
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:01,169
No, there's another one.

217
00:14:01,837 --> 00:14:03,964
<i>- Sound of Music?
- No, what...</i>

218
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,036
Your favorite science fiction movie?

219
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,544
<i>- I'm not a fan of...
- E. T.</i>

220
00:14:12,081 --> 00:14:13,070
Right?

221
00:14:13,782 --> 00:14:15,875
- That's your favorite.
- Yes.

222
00:14:16,752 --> 00:14:18,413
I love that movie.

223
00:14:19,021 --> 00:14:22,389
You rented it and showed it to him
when he was a kid.

224
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:26,085
You wondered if aliens really existed.

225
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:30,530
If it's possible to fly spaceships
to other planets in other solar systems.

226
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,761
- What has this got to do with...
- It is

227
00:14:34,537 --> 00:14:35,561
possible.

228
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:38,870
Not just to other solar systems,
other galaxies.

229
00:14:39,376 --> 00:14:42,573
You see, the government,
they have this program,

230
00:14:42,646 --> 00:14:44,443
the Stargate program.

231
00:14:44,781 --> 00:14:47,478
And what a Stargate is,
is it's like a doorway.

232
00:14:47,952 --> 00:14:51,979
It allows you to step through
and travel great distances through space,

233
00:14:52,056 --> 00:14:54,081
halfway across the universe
in some cases...

234
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:56,718
- Why are you telling me this?
- Because I am Eli.

235
00:15:01,265 --> 00:15:04,063
I'm on a ship, far, far away,

236
00:15:04,135 --> 00:15:07,502
but my consciousness
is in this person's body.

237
00:15:07,672 --> 00:15:11,574
It really is me, Mom. I am your son.

238
00:15:15,747 --> 00:15:18,079
You have no memory
of going into the storage room?

239
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,142
No, I fell asleep in my quarters.

240
00:15:21,586 --> 00:15:23,884
Next thing I know,
I'm talking to Lieutenant James.

241
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:27,221
This isn't the first time
this has happened, is it?

242
00:15:27,292 --> 00:15:31,058
It's like I black out from time to time.

243
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,594
Those aliens
used the communication stones

244
00:15:33,665 --> 00:15:36,463
- to take control of Lieutenant James.
- Because we forgot to reset them.

245
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:39,060
I was just in the communications lab.
The stones are clean.

246
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:42,633
Listen, there doesn't seem to be anything
physically wrong with you that I can tell.

247
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:46,042
I'd need an EEG or a CAT scan
to be more thorough.

248
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,546
I would like to keep her overnight, though,
for observation.

249
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:50,682
That's a good idea.

250
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:56,114
And once the stone is in place
and the device is turned on,

251
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:59,522
you actually swap consciousness
with the person on the other end.

252
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:04,160
You go into their body
and then they go into yours, and...

253
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:07,125
And...

254
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:09,792
You don't believe me.

255
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:14,630
- I don't understand.
- I know. I know it's weird.

256
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:16,237
Where is Eli?

257
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:21,640
<i>He's on a ship, okay, the Destiny,
on the other side of the universe.</i>

258
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:23,114
When is he coming home?

259
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:26,550
I don't know, it's a long, long way.
Billions of light years from Earth.

260
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,418
- How did he get there?
- The Stargate, Mom!

261
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:30,921
Okay. Okay, Mom...

262
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:33,722
Stop calling me that. You are not my son.

263
00:16:40,735 --> 00:16:42,362
The day Dad left,

264
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:45,601
I was 14.

265
00:16:47,475 --> 00:16:49,602
I ran up to my room, crying.

266
00:16:52,313 --> 00:16:56,511
You came up,
told me that I needed to be strong for you.

267
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:00,980
You said I needed to be the man
that he wasn't.

268
00:17:04,093 --> 00:17:05,424
Remember?

269
00:17:09,932 --> 00:17:12,560
How could I know that if I wasn't Eli?

270
00:17:15,638 --> 00:17:17,265
He could've told you.

271
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,008
How could he possibly have told me
every little thing about his...

272
00:17:20,076 --> 00:17:23,978
- Leave me alone!
- Please, Mom. It really is me.

273
00:17:24,046 --> 00:17:26,572
- Nurse, nurse!
- I know it's a lot to take in. Mom?

274
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,845
- Nurse! Please leave.
- Please.

275
00:18:13,664 --> 00:18:16,656
What is it? Ancient?
Some of it.

276
00:18:16,968 --> 00:18:21,702
Those symbols, they looked familiar to me,
and then I remembered where I saw them.

277
00:18:21,773 --> 00:18:23,240
In the crashed alien ship.

278
00:18:23,609 --> 00:18:26,840
Some of this I understand,
but most of it's too far advanced.

279
00:18:26,912 --> 00:18:29,881
They must've done something to her,
planted something in her brain.

280
00:18:29,948 --> 00:18:32,815
You said she didn't have
any tracking devices in her.

281
00:18:32,885 --> 00:18:34,682
No, she didn't. Not that I was aware of.

282
00:18:36,155 --> 00:18:39,989
There may be something happening
to Chloe on a cellular level.

283
00:18:40,926 --> 00:18:45,159
Some kind of genetic manipulation
gradually changing her.

284
00:18:45,465 --> 00:18:48,263
- Into what?
- You think she's changing into one of them?

285
00:18:48,334 --> 00:18:49,596
I want her quarantined.

286
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:51,660
We don't know for sure
if that's what's going on here.

287
00:18:51,738 --> 00:18:54,070
- We cannot just lock her up.
- Until we know what's wrong with her,

288
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,075
I can't risk letting her walk around free
on this ship, can I?

289
00:18:57,577 --> 00:18:59,977
I think the risk might be worth it.

290
00:19:00,046 --> 00:19:03,504
If we can monitor her behavior,
the frequency of her blackouts,

291
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,483
where she goes, what she does,

292
00:19:05,552 --> 00:19:08,578
we might gain more insight
into what's actually happening.

293
00:19:08,655 --> 00:19:11,716
Certainly quicker
than isolating her in a room.

294
00:19:12,626 --> 00:19:15,151
She's not to be left alone, ever.

295
00:19:15,796 --> 00:19:17,058
Yes, sir.

296
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,801
Hey.

297
00:19:25,906 --> 00:19:27,066
Thanks for coming.

298
00:19:27,675 --> 00:19:30,371
I didn't have anyone else I could call.

299
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,340
Well, how's your mom doing?

300
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:39,787
Physically, fine.

301
00:19:41,256 --> 00:19:42,883
Her pneumonia's healing.

302
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:47,827
Her T-cell counts are stable now that
they've restarted her therapy, but she's...

303
00:19:49,264 --> 00:19:52,961
I was always worried she might give up
if something happened to me,

304
00:19:53,034 --> 00:19:55,696
- and now, she's...
- Nothing's happened to you.

305
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,294
She doesn't even know it's me.

306
00:19:58,173 --> 00:20:02,234
I tried to tell her.
But as far as she's concerned,

307
00:20:02,644 --> 00:20:05,045
the military took her son away,

308
00:20:05,948 --> 00:20:11,079
won't even tell her where he is
or won't let him talk to her.

309
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:17,515
I would give up too.

310
00:20:17,793 --> 00:20:18,782
Eli,

311
00:20:19,695 --> 00:20:21,458
no one is giving up.

312
00:20:21,964 --> 00:20:26,128
You know, whether she believes you or not,
she has to take her meds.

313
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:30,298
And you need to make her understand that.

314
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:42,341
I can't go near the Control Interface Room
or use the stones to visit my mom.

315
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:44,910
It's only temporary, just till we figure
out what's going on here.

316
00:20:44,988 --> 00:20:48,389
Lieutenant, time for a shift change.
I'll take over from here.

317
00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:52,495
- Oh, it's okay. I don't mind.
- Colonel's orders, I'm afraid.

318
00:20:54,331 --> 00:20:56,458
I promise I won't let her out of my sight.

319
00:20:58,503 --> 00:21:00,027
It's all right.

320
00:21:00,805 --> 00:21:01,794
Okay.

321
00:21:03,007 --> 00:21:05,100
I'll check in on you later.

322
00:21:07,545 --> 00:21:09,012
Come with me.

323
00:21:23,862 --> 00:21:25,329
What is this?

324
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:28,328
A place for study.

325
00:21:29,668 --> 00:21:31,329
Problems to solve.

326
00:21:38,043 --> 00:21:40,671
Does any of this look familiar to you?

327
00:21:45,117 --> 00:21:46,414
Take your time.

328
00:21:47,853 --> 00:21:49,321
Look closely.

329
00:22:36,737 --> 00:22:38,671
- Settling in?
- Yes.

330
00:22:39,373 --> 00:22:41,273
Nice quarters. Come in.

331
00:22:42,477 --> 00:22:44,911
The Ancients probably figured
they'd be here a while,

332
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,574
might as well give themselves
some measure of comfort.

333
00:22:48,817 --> 00:22:50,580
How long will they
be tagging along with us?

334
00:22:52,587 --> 00:22:54,612
As long as you give them reason to.

335
00:22:56,191 --> 00:23:00,491
- One of your men, Simeon.
- Yes, I know. I heard. And I'm sorry.

336
00:23:01,229 --> 00:23:04,392
He's not the most diplomatic person
in our group.

337
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:07,627
The culture on his homeworld
was rougher than most.

338
00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:10,796
Colonel Young has decided to release him,
but if he slips up again...

339
00:23:10,873 --> 00:23:12,500
I'll talk to him.

340
00:23:13,209 --> 00:23:14,938
We're trying to make this work.

341
00:23:15,745 --> 00:23:17,269
He needs to try harder.

342
00:23:27,457 --> 00:23:28,446
Hey!

343
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:31,986
Oh, there you are.
Been looking all over for you.

344
00:23:32,061 --> 00:23:34,791
You didn't answer your
radio, so I thought...

345
00:23:34,864 --> 00:23:36,992
Sorry. Lost track of time.

346
00:23:37,701 --> 00:23:39,293
She's all yours.

347
00:23:43,373 --> 00:23:44,362
You okay?

348
00:23:45,676 --> 00:23:46,836
Yeah. Fine.

349
00:23:47,744 --> 00:23:49,211
What were you doing?

350
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,911
He wanted me to look at some equations,

351
00:23:53,383 --> 00:23:55,977
- see if I understood them.
- Did you?

352
00:23:58,355 --> 00:23:59,686
I don't know.

353
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:08,064
Hey, sorry I'm late.

354
00:24:09,601 --> 00:24:13,128
It's just that Eli, you know,
when he gets to talking...

355
00:24:14,305 --> 00:24:16,637
- How's his mother?
- Oh!

356
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:21,671
Doing okay, physically. It's just emotionally.
This is all starting to take its toll.

357
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:26,845
You okay?

358
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,915
Your dinner's in the oven.

359
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,321
You cooked?

360
00:24:33,392 --> 00:24:35,326
Mmm. An attempt.

361
00:24:39,832 --> 00:24:42,130
- Looks good.
- Famous last words.

362
00:24:46,338 --> 00:24:48,135
So, how was your day?

363
00:24:48,641 --> 00:24:50,506
Mmm, long.

364
00:24:51,076 --> 00:24:53,237
Exhausting. The usual.

365
00:24:56,149 --> 00:24:57,776
I'll get another.

366
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:06,521
Give us a minute. Back inside.

367
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:13,793
- I won't let you ruin this for us.
- I was just talking to the woman.

368
00:25:13,867 --> 00:25:17,735
- You wanna get us all locked up for good?
- What difference does it make?

369
00:25:17,804 --> 00:25:19,101
Sooner or later they're gonna realize

370
00:25:19,172 --> 00:25:21,937
the information we've been feeding them
is just a bunch of lies anyway.

371
00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:23,636
The information you've been feeding them.

372
00:25:24,645 --> 00:25:26,738
What are you talking about?

373
00:25:27,214 --> 00:25:29,341
I thought we were all giving them
the same misinformation...

374
00:25:29,417 --> 00:25:31,908
We're cooperating with them, all of us.

375
00:25:33,487 --> 00:25:36,684
We have to find a way
to get along with these people.

376
00:25:39,327 --> 00:25:43,263
You want me to play the game, I'll play it,
but I'm not taking... I'm not taking...

377
00:25:43,331 --> 00:25:45,731
Don't play any game at all.
Don't play any game at all!

378
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,126
Just keep your mouth shut.

379
00:26:06,955 --> 00:26:08,183
Damn it.

380
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:12,651
Again with this?

381
00:26:13,061 --> 00:26:15,087
- No gates.
- Altered course.

382
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:18,198
Bet you a day's rations he doesn't answer.

383
00:26:18,735 --> 00:26:21,499
Dr. Rush, this is Brody. Come in.

384
00:26:24,741 --> 00:26:26,732
Dr. Rush, please respond.

385
00:26:28,177 --> 00:26:30,702
- You owe me.
- I never agreed to that.

386
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,940
I don't think
it's because of pulsar damage.

387
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:36,948
There would be a pattern to the jump
intervals, however frequent they are.

388
00:26:37,086 --> 00:26:40,545
There's also the changes in the
ship's course once we drop out of FTL.

389
00:26:40,624 --> 00:26:42,990
It also seems too coincidental
that every time this happens,

390
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,085
we can't seem to get a hold of Rush.

391
00:26:45,162 --> 00:26:47,255
He's doing this? How?

392
00:26:47,631 --> 00:26:50,156
Outside of cracking the master code?

393
00:26:50,467 --> 00:26:52,526
- I don't know.
- Figure it out.

394
00:26:52,603 --> 00:26:55,629
- Yeah. We could really use Eli for that.
- Eli's not here right now.

395
00:26:55,706 --> 00:26:57,936
- Well, you can get him back.
- He needs to be where he is right now,

396
00:26:58,008 --> 00:27:00,306
so I need you to figure it out.

397
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,940
Why is your radio off?

398
00:27:04,882 --> 00:27:07,147
- Sorry, I was in my quarters sleeping.
- Wrong.

399
00:27:07,552 --> 00:27:10,680
You didn't answer my call,
I sent Corporal Barnes to your quarters.

400
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:12,051
Where were you?

401
00:27:12,991 --> 00:27:14,891
Okay, so what's happening? What's wrong?

402
00:27:14,959 --> 00:27:16,688
<i>Just trying to figure out
what's going on with Destiny.</i>

403
00:27:16,761 --> 00:27:18,729
Where the hell were you?

404
00:27:28,206 --> 00:27:29,605
What's this?

405
00:27:29,774 --> 00:27:31,571
I come here to think.

406
00:27:31,776 --> 00:27:33,540
And write on the walls?

407
00:27:34,046 --> 00:27:38,540
Working on problems that have confused us
since we set foot in this ship, Mr. Brody.

408
00:27:40,052 --> 00:27:42,282
This one has been particularly frustrating,

409
00:27:42,955 --> 00:27:44,047
and yet Chloe,

410
00:27:45,091 --> 00:27:46,718
she solved it in a minute flat.

411
00:27:48,227 --> 00:27:52,288
Whatever alien influence she's under,
it's studying this ship.

412
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:56,658
So you think she's hijacked the ship's
system during one of her blackouts?

413
00:27:56,736 --> 00:27:59,763
Something she could have set in motion
days, perhaps even weeks ago.

414
00:28:27,368 --> 00:28:28,801
This section's off limits.

415
00:28:30,438 --> 00:28:32,531
- Wasn't earlier.
- It is now.

416
00:28:32,907 --> 00:28:35,341
- Why?
- Back to your quarters.

417
00:28:38,746 --> 00:28:40,805
You're going to keep doing this, are you?

418
00:28:42,884 --> 00:28:44,249
Pushing me.

419
00:28:44,886 --> 00:28:47,047
Get me to do something
so you can lock me back up.

420
00:28:47,121 --> 00:28:48,315
Back

421
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:49,583
to your

422
00:28:49,791 --> 00:28:50,849
quarters.

423
00:28:53,695 --> 00:28:57,825
You're talking tough, you're armed,
you got your men here covering you.

424
00:29:02,004 --> 00:29:03,096
That's true.

425
00:29:10,379 --> 00:29:11,710
Dismissed.

426
00:29:19,422 --> 00:29:21,014
You were saying?

427
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,242
You okay?

428
00:29:56,393 --> 00:29:57,985
Just let me know

429
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:03,189
and we'll get you whatever you need.
Colonel's just doing this as a precaution.

430
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:07,204
What do they think is happening to me?

431
00:30:09,373 --> 00:30:11,069
They don't know yet.

432
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,372
I feel like I'm slipping away,

433
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,511
bit by bit.

434
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:18,206
No.

435
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:22,147
No, no. We're going to figure this out.

436
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:25,115
We're going to fix it. I promise.

437
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:36,564
You can't sleep?

438
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:44,803
I look at you, and

439
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:48,245
I know it's you, but still,

440
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,847
I miss

441
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:54,783
your face,

442
00:30:58,024 --> 00:30:59,389
your voice.

443
00:31:01,761 --> 00:31:03,228
This is hard.

444
00:31:04,464 --> 00:31:07,194
Probably worse on you than it is for me.

445
00:31:13,807 --> 00:31:16,674
This situation,

446
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:21,742
it's so easy to lose hope.
I've seen it in others.

447
00:31:22,115 --> 00:31:24,606
But what keeps me sane

448
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:28,385
are these few moments we're together.

449
00:31:28,455 --> 00:31:32,392
Being able to come home and see you and...

450
00:31:33,761 --> 00:31:35,228
And hold you.

451
00:31:36,331 --> 00:31:39,494
Even if it's just for a day or a minute,

452
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:44,964
it's... It's what's keeping me going.

453
00:31:52,714 --> 00:31:54,648
- I'll be okay.
- I know.

454
00:31:54,716 --> 00:31:57,242
- I'll be okay. I'll be okay.
- I know.

455
00:32:00,956 --> 00:32:03,049
It's coming up now.

456
00:32:03,859 --> 00:32:05,019
There.

457
00:32:08,464 --> 00:32:10,432
- And she just sits there the whole time?
- Yes.

458
00:32:10,566 --> 00:32:12,158
In her earlier one, she wrote in the diary.

459
00:32:12,234 --> 00:32:15,431
But mostly she just sits or lies still,
staring at the walls.

460
00:32:16,338 --> 00:32:18,465
I still can't detect
any physical changes in her.

461
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:22,533
Without proper equipment,
I don't really know what else I can do.

462
00:32:22,745 --> 00:32:25,374
Colonel, I know you're just doing this
to keep her away from others,

463
00:32:25,448 --> 00:32:27,848
but quarantine is not a long-term solution.

464
00:32:29,419 --> 00:32:30,613
I know.

465
00:32:41,698 --> 00:32:43,188
- Nurse?
- Wait, no.

466
00:32:43,266 --> 00:32:46,997
Please, just listen, and then I'll leave.

467
00:32:48,204 --> 00:32:49,536
I promise.

468
00:32:50,074 --> 00:32:52,304
Whether you believe me or not,

469
00:32:53,277 --> 00:32:56,110
the fact is, I'm worried.

470
00:32:57,481 --> 00:32:59,142
Eli's worried.

471
00:33:00,718 --> 00:33:03,118
I can't leave you here like this.

472
00:33:11,729 --> 00:33:13,526
He was all that I had.

473
00:33:15,366 --> 00:33:17,767
He's why I got up in the morning.

474
00:33:19,271 --> 00:33:22,104
Never realized it fully until he was gone.

475
00:33:24,776 --> 00:33:26,243
Just tell me,

476
00:33:27,813 --> 00:33:29,838
will I ever see him again?

477
00:33:35,187 --> 00:33:37,087
I don't know.

478
00:33:45,832 --> 00:33:49,461
I can't leave her like this.
I can't go back to that ship.

479
00:33:49,535 --> 00:33:52,902
<i>- If I leave her, she's going...
Eli. Eli, listen to me.</i>

480
00:33:53,139 --> 00:33:55,903
Whatever happens,
you will get through this.

481
00:33:55,975 --> 00:33:57,442
<i>Maybe you could talk to her.</i>

482
00:33:58,177 --> 00:34:02,409
Someone else from the Stargate program.
Maybe then she'll believe me.

483
00:34:02,815 --> 00:34:04,214
I've got a better idea.

484
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,575
<i>I'll call you right back.</i>

485
00:34:14,328 --> 00:34:16,262
<i>I know it's
beyond her clearance.</i>

486
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,525
<i>You're just going to have
to make an exception.</i>

487
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,032
He unlocked the ninth chevron.

488
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,729
He's quite possibly
the most important person on that crew.

489
00:34:23,804 --> 00:34:27,137
We need him to be emotionally healthy,
focused.

490
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:31,839
You know what, I'm not asking you.
I'm telling you, make this happen.

491
00:34:53,535 --> 00:34:56,129
<i>Mrs. Wallace, welcome
to the Destiny.</i>

492
00:35:01,109 --> 00:35:02,168
Hi, Mom.

493
00:35:04,747 --> 00:35:06,612
Yeah. I'm real.

494
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,879
Eli.

495
00:35:12,454 --> 00:35:13,512
Eli.

496
00:35:21,463 --> 00:35:23,226
Come here.

497
00:35:24,066 --> 00:35:25,556
I want to show you something.

498
00:35:28,738 --> 00:35:31,263
The other side of the universe, Mom.

499
00:35:32,709 --> 00:35:34,574
Pretty cool, isn't it?

500
00:35:38,014 --> 00:35:39,003
Yeah.

501
00:35:39,983 --> 00:35:41,177
I know.

502
00:35:41,284 --> 00:35:43,582
I was speechless at first, too,

503
00:35:44,454 --> 00:35:46,422
if you can believe that.

504
00:35:47,624 --> 00:35:51,253
It's an amazing ship.
We're still trying to figure it out.

505
00:35:54,432 --> 00:35:56,730
See if there's some way
we can get back home.

506
00:35:59,237 --> 00:36:01,967
I'll never stop trying. I promise.

507
00:36:09,847 --> 00:36:11,576
We're going to be okay, Mom,

508
00:36:12,516 --> 00:36:13,881
you and me.

509
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,315
I'm so proud of you.

510
00:36:20,658 --> 00:36:23,992
Yeah, blew her mind, didn't it?
Oh, yeah.

511
00:36:24,062 --> 00:36:26,587
She's leaving the hospital tomorrow.

512
00:36:28,734 --> 00:36:30,929
Thanks for letting her come here.

513
00:36:31,003 --> 00:36:32,868
And don't worry,
she knows it's a one-time thing.

514
00:36:32,938 --> 00:36:35,771
She won't be asking to come by every week.

515
00:36:35,874 --> 00:36:37,933
Anyway, I owe you one.

516
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:41,138
You owe Wray.
She's the one who made it happen.

517
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,710
<i>Colonel
Young, come in.</i>

518
00:36:44,883 --> 00:36:46,043
Yeah, go ahead.

519
00:36:46,118 --> 00:36:48,110
<i>I think I have a solution
to Chloe's condition.</i>

520
00:36:48,721 --> 00:36:49,779
Well, let's hear it.

521
00:36:50,823 --> 00:36:52,381
The neural interface.

522
00:36:52,825 --> 00:36:54,156
The chair?

523
00:36:55,862 --> 00:36:57,887
I believe it can cure her.

524
00:37:05,738 --> 00:37:07,069
Look, it's relatively simple.

525
00:37:07,407 --> 00:37:08,669
From what I've learned so far,

526
00:37:08,741 --> 00:37:12,370
I believe the chair will not allow
any non-human to interface with it.

527
00:37:12,445 --> 00:37:13,640
There are safeguards built in

528
00:37:13,714 --> 00:37:16,376
that would destroy
any alien life form that tries to use it.

529
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:19,817
So the chair kills off
any potential alien matter inside her,

530
00:37:19,887 --> 00:37:22,856
- while leaving her human side unaffected.
Exactly.

531
00:37:22,923 --> 00:37:25,391
You "believe," meaning you're not sure?

532
00:37:25,459 --> 00:37:28,758
- Well, no, I can't be absolutely certain...
- It's too dangerous.

533
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:31,195
Look, I've made improvements
to the program I developed

534
00:37:31,265 --> 00:37:34,996
when I used the chair.
They should prevent her from being harmed.

535
00:37:35,202 --> 00:37:38,035
I'm now able to sever the connection
externally, at any time.

536
00:37:38,205 --> 00:37:40,674
She shouldn't have to sit in it very long,
a few seconds at most.

537
00:37:40,742 --> 00:37:45,042
- If you can't be 100% sure, I don't...
- It's the best option anyone's come up with.

538
00:37:46,414 --> 00:37:48,575
The only option.

539
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:51,118
Colonel, you can't force her to do this.

540
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,585
Well, then, I'll ask her.

541
00:38:00,962 --> 00:38:04,921
Are you sure you're okay with this?
Yes, I'm fine.

542
00:38:05,467 --> 00:38:09,336
It's all right. The chair won't activate
till I input the proper command.

543
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:21,580
- We're ready.
- Okay.

544
00:38:23,919 --> 00:38:25,045
Go ahead.

545
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:52,273
She's breathing and her pulse is steady.

546
00:38:54,151 --> 00:38:56,551
- Did it work?
I believe so.

547
00:38:57,754 --> 00:39:00,189
But we'll soon find out, won't we?

548
00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:10,634
- Hey.
- Hey.

549
00:39:10,701 --> 00:39:14,228
I just wanted to thank you for pulling
the strings to let my mom come here.

550
00:39:14,305 --> 00:39:16,330
I know it's something that

551
00:39:17,475 --> 00:39:20,069
a lot of people here would want.

552
00:39:21,879 --> 00:39:24,143
Does she believe you now?

553
00:39:26,018 --> 00:39:27,042
Yeah.

554
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,520
Yeah, she does. They're discharging her
from the hospital today.

555
00:39:30,989 --> 00:39:32,388
- Oh.
- Anyway,

556
00:39:33,025 --> 00:39:35,823
it was great having you there to talk to.

557
00:39:37,296 --> 00:39:40,288
Someone who gets
what we're going through.

558
00:39:47,606 --> 00:39:49,904
We'll keep an eye on her, 24/7.

559
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,611
You okay?
- Yeah.

560
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,945
Can I get you anything?

561
00:39:56,049 --> 00:39:59,416
No. I'm good.
Just want to lie down for a little bit.

562
00:40:06,326 --> 00:40:07,850
I'm fine, Matt.

563
00:40:19,373 --> 00:40:22,206
- Mrs. Wallace?
- Yes.

564
00:40:23,043 --> 00:40:24,704
I'm Sharon Walker.

565
00:40:25,646 --> 00:40:28,342
- Your son Eli suggested...
- Oh, yes.

566
00:40:28,849 --> 00:40:30,009
Hello.

567
00:40:34,588 --> 00:40:35,748
We need to talk.

568
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,863
I'm not cured, am I?

569
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:49,559
No.

570
00:41:34,717 --> 00:41:36,844
Do you really think
she can help you?

571
00:41:36,919 --> 00:41:38,251
I do, yes.

572
00:41:39,056 --> 00:41:41,081
If she values her freedom,

573
00:41:41,758 --> 00:41:44,556
she'll play along without telling anyone.

574
00:41:45,929 --> 00:41:47,954
I need her to be this way.

575
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:50,191
For now, anyway.

576
00:41:50,834 --> 00:41:52,699
But can you trust her?

577
00:43:33,541 --> 00:43:34,530
English - US - SDH
