1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,801
RUSH: Destiny.
The design is clearly Ancient.

2
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:08,100
Launched hundreds of thousands
of years ago.

3
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,698
SCOTT: Where the hell are we?

4
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:11,936
Several billion light years from home.

5
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:15,981
We are on a ship, but we have no idea
where we are in relation to Earth.

6
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:19,882
RUSH: This ship could be the most
important discovery mankind has made

7
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:21,248
since the stargate itself.

8
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,652
YOUNG: These are the wrong people
in the wrong place.

9
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:25,725
SCOTT: I've got a lot of wounded.
We need to get home.

10
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:28,521
RUSH: We barely have enough power
to operate the main systems.

11
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:31,859
This ship simply doesn't have
the capability to dial Earth.

12
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:36,094
In this case are
five Ancient communication stones.

13
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:39,000
RUSH: You physically take control
of an individual at the other end.

14
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:42,297
SCOTT: She's not going to have it.

15
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:46,539
She's 16. We barely even know each other.

16
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:51,911
If anyone finds this within the next,
I don't know, 40 years,

17
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:54,450
tell Sharon that

18
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:01,120
my last thoughts were of her.

19
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:07,761
Well I know, I miss more than hit

20
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:14,034
With a face that was launched to sink

21
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:19,637
And I seldom feel

22
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:23,113
The bright relief

23
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:29,949
It's been the worst day since yesterday

24
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:36,723
If there's one thing I have said

25
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,363
Is that the dreams I once had

26
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,936
Now lay in bed

27
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:48,766
As the four winds blow

28
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:52,402
My wits through the door

29
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:59,347
It's been the worst day since yesterday

30
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:07,387
Falling down to you, sweet ground

31
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:10,793
Where the flowers, they bloom

32
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:14,424
It's there I'll be found

33
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:21,372
Hurry back to me, my wild Colleen

34
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:29,247
It's been the worst day since yesterday

35
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:38,080
MEHTA: Hey.

36
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:41,258
Your shift's over.

37
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,022
I'm good.

38
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,289
You need rest.

39
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:46,759
I've been sitting on my ass for hours.

40
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:48,857
General O'Neill's orders.

41
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,109
Got plans for tonight?

42
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,852
This is delicious.
My compliments to the chef.

43
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:15,754
I'll give you his number, and he delivers.

44
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,428
No kidding?

45
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,260
Listen, I want to say thank you.

46
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:26,171
There aren't many people
that understand what I'm going through.

47
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,773
Happy to help. Anytime.

48
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:32,701
Is everything okay?

49
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:38,714
We've only known each other a short time,
but I'd like to feel I can call you a friend.

50
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,410
Yeah, of course you can.

51
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,856
And as such, I feel a certain obligation

52
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:51,361
to tell you some things
about your husband.

53
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,056
SCOTT: Hey!

54
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:32,598
- You were supposed to join us.
- Yeah, I know. Sorry, I pulled a thing.

55
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:35,230
Yeah, Colonel Young
wants everybody in shape.

56
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,138
Tomorrow. Tomorrow, yeah, I promise.

57
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:40,508
Okay, let's go. Come on.

58
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:49,453
To hell with this.

59
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,424
- Hey.
- Hello.

60
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:57,356
JOHANSEN: Mind if I join you?

61
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,594
- You okay?
- Fine.

62
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:12,035
'Cause you look a little tired.
You getting any sleep?

63
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:15,573
I said I'm fine.

64
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:20,751
I'm fine, too. Thanks for asking.

65
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:26,524
- RUSH: Eli.
- Yo.

66
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:29,284
We've managed to secure
two more sections of the ship.

67
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:32,826
I'm sending a team in to take a look.
I need you to operate the Kino for me.

68
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:34,599
Kind of busy here.

69
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,066
Doing what?

70
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:40,003
I can't say.

71
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:42,639
And what's that supposed to mean?

72
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,107
That I was told not to say.

73
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,711
Oh, a secret mission, is it? How intriguing.

74
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:51,416
Look, you're gonna have to
talk to Colonel Young about this.

75
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:54,720
Eli, do me a favor,
have a look at your chest.

76
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,513
Is there any insignia there,
anything that says

77
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:00,421
"lieutenant" or "sergeant,"
or anything like that?

78
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:05,489
- All I got is "You Are Here."
- Exactly.

79
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,359
- I'll be down when I'm done.
- No, no, don't bother. I'll manage.

80
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,467
He says he's fine,
but I'm worried about him.

81
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:15,939
Him and about a dozen others.

82
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:20,103
Listen, I want you to do psych evaluations.
Everyone, civilians, military.

83
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,306
I've been meaning
to ask you to do it anyway.

84
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,280
Don't you think Camile
might want to do it, being HR?

85
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,181
You took psych in college, right?

86
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:28,116
One course, undergrad.
That hardly qualifies me.

87
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,985
That's perfect. Get to it. You can do it.

88
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,534
Hold on. The door to your right, try it.

89
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,786
GREER: More quarters.

90
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:06,220
- Not bad.
- Moving on.

91
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:10,525
So do I start crying now,
or do we build up to that?

92
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,093
Why don't you just tell me
how you're doing?

93
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,327
- How I'm doing?
- With life on the ship.

94
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,839
It sucks. I hate it.

95
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,401
Okay, how about your hydroponics lab?
Any luck there?

96
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,876
The seeds won't sprout,
which really sucks,

97
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:30,278
because I would have liked
to have started to grow some food.

98
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:32,544
I'm not really
much of a fruit and vegetable guy,

99
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,519
but anything would be better than
the crap that you've been serving us.

100
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:38,454
And there's not enough water,
and the beds are rock hard,

101
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:44,224
and, oh, don't let me forget to mention
that I was shot by one of your people!

102
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,062
So you're doing fine, then.

103
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,637
Eli, how's it coming?

104
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:57,340
I've run simulations on a dozen variations
of Telford's plan to power the gate,

105
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:01,746
but so far problems.

106
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:07,184
- Such as?
- Catastrophic failure, every time.

107
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:12,089
Horrible death, fire and brimstone,
dogs and cats living together...

108
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:13,419
I get it.

109
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,890
Keep at it. I want to make sure.

110
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:21,194
Lieutenant, you're next up
to use the stones to visit Earth.

111
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:26,636
- It's all right, sir. I can wait.
- You've been waiting. Take your turn.

112
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:30,266
- Wray will be going, too.
- All right. All right. Thanks.

113
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,208
RUSH: Go ahead.

114
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,413
BOONE: What the hell is this?

115
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,083
GREER: Hey, looks like
we found the dentist's office.

116
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:05,368
Don't touch anything.
Leave it! I'm on my way.

117
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,551
Lieutenant Scott? It's me, Camile.

118
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,697
Weird.

119
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:35,798
YOUNG: Neural interface?

120
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:39,635
A precursor to an Ancient device
SG-1 discovered several years ago.

121
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:45,007
A repository of knowledge that can be
literally downloaded into one's mind.

122
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,681
You think this is one of those things?

123
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:48,754
Within that knowledge

124
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:52,346
may be the master code
to unlock the ship's core systems.

125
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,486
- Navigation, propulsion.
- You're sure?

126
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,054
We can't be certain
till someone actually sits in the chair.

127
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:01,395
It looks like it holds you down
and shoots bolts into your head.

128
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,799
These are merely electrodes
allowing the transfer of data.

129
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:08,772
Do you know what a device like this
did to General O'Neill?

130
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,774
The sheer amount of information
overwhelmed him, yes.

131
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,242
It damn near killed him, is what it did.

132
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:16,873
- It led to incredible discoveries...
- And it damn near killed him.

133
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,007
In fact, the only thing we know for sure

134
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:21,484
is an Ancient device like this
is pretty much a death sentence.

135
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:24,647
Nobody sits in this thing.
I want guard detail posted.

136
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:27,624
So, what are we to do, Colonel?
Just ignore what this chair can do for us?

137
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,661
I'm not telling you to ignore it.

138
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,287
I'm telling you to study it
without sitting in it.

139
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:35,731
But, Colonel, this predates
those found in the Milky Way.

140
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,294
I'd be willing to bet
the effects are far less severe.

141
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,532
Would you bet your own life?

142
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:45,303
So, you're fine
as long as someone else volunteers?

143
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,743
Hell, if it means
getting these people home,

144
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:48,836
I'll sit in the damn thing.

145
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:52,782
- JAMES: Colonel Young, come in.
- Go ahead.

146
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,819
Colonel Telford's
in the communications lab.

147
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,320
He switched bodies with Scott
and he wants to talk to you.

148
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:58,390
I'm on my way.

149
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:02,825
Colonel, so far I've only managed
to access portions of Destiny's database.

150
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,290
We still can't actually control the ship.

151
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:08,265
Even if we could turn this thing around
right now, head back to Earth,

152
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:11,461
how long would that take,
another million years?

153
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:15,062
Rush, you want this chair to be some
kind of wonderful discovery, that's fine.

154
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,141
Prove it.

155
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:19,336
You prove you can use it safely
to do something we actually need it to do.

156
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:22,710
Until then no one goes near.

157
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,287
Always you on the stones.
Don't you let anyone else take a turn?

158
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:36,190
Why haven't you given us any of the data
collected during our experiment?

159
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:38,024
We're still working on it ourselves.

160
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,654
I've got a team
of the best scientists on Earth.

161
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:40,754
We want to help.

162
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,926
Till things get out of hand,
then you jump ship, leave us on our own.

163
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:47,597
How did Rush do it?
How did he defuse the situation?

164
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,197
When I know, you'll know.

165
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:51,071
You know, Colonel, I don't get it.

166
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,771
I would think you'd be doing everything
possible to get these people home,

167
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,712
to get yourself home, back to your wife.

168
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:04,320
If you need anything,
ask Lieutenant James.

169
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:11,192
STROM: Camile, it is you, right?

170
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,256
I didn't know
that you were checking in today.

171
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:17,733
Oh, I'm not, actually.
This is a personal visit.

172
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,101
Last time I was here,
I didn't get a chance to go home.

173
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:23,004
Right, of course, but since I have you...

174
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,835
I'll be there in a minute.

175
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:32,045
Colonel Telford's team
is working on adjustments to their plan.

176
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,277
They're making some progress.

177
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:37,048
Young is not going to listen,
at least not anytime soon.

178
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:42,550
And Dr. Rush, well, like you said,
he's in no hurry to come home.

179
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,858
Still trying to take command of the ship?

180
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,364
He and Young are bumping heads, yes.

181
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:50,594
Right now,
Young seems to be winning that battle.

182
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,431
And you?

183
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:57,639
I'm caught between them,
not sure which camp is the better choice.

184
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:00,303
Maybe it's time you started your own.

185
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:06,042
Your mail, all four letters. Popular guy.

186
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:08,485
So, I'm your chaperone.

187
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,316
Where do you want to go?
Any family, friends?

188
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:15,052
There's a buddy I want to catch up with.
He's at Edwards, or he was...

189
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:16,526
No problem.

190
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,260
You okay?

191
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,795
I would imagine the level of stress

192
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:26,804
that comes along with trying to figure out
the inner workings of this ship...

193
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:29,306
I know, it's intense, especially figuring that

194
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:32,434
we've only just scratched the surface
of all there is to know.

195
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,134
So how are you dealing with it?

196
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:37,409
I mean, what are you doing
to relieve the stress?

197
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:39,573
Oh.

198
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,255
I read.

199
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:51,360
Thirty-five, 36, 37, 38, 39!

200
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:57,834
One, two, three, 18!
One, two, three, 19! Move it, move it!

201
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:02,601
Faster! Come on, people, faster!
Faster, Franklin, move it!

202
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,136
You're pathetic, Franklin, you know that?
Go again!

203
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:11,416
Again, Franklin! Move that fat ass!
You're pathetic! Go again!

204
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:17,514
She's not cleared,
so stick with the cover story.

205
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,284
Hey, there.

206
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,786
I'm looking for Annie Balic.
I'm an old friend of hers.

207
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,584
Does she live here?

208
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,024
She's my mom.

209
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,213
Is it really you?

210
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:38,994
If someone wants to volunteer to sit in it,
why won't he let them?

211
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,436
- He's trying to protect us.
- Oh, please.

212
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,007
It's politics.

213
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:47,744
He resists at first, comes around
eventually, gives it the green light,

214
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,814
and if it works, he's the big hero.

215
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:54,113
And if it doesn't,
well, you get to take the blame.

216
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:58,547
Yes.

217
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:02,522
How am I coping? Honestly?

218
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,390
I don't know.

219
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,765
The people onboard make it easier,
that's for sure.

220
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:14,332
I made some good friends. And I met Matt.

221
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:19,143
So there's that to be grateful for.

222
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:22,272
So are things
getting serious between you two?

223
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,274
He's been a real comfort.

224
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:33,458
When we're together, it's not so lonely.

225
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,557
You know?

226
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:50,403
When everyone has gone to sleep

227
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:55,139
And you are wide awake

228
00:16:55,247 --> 00:17:00,241
There's no one left to tell your troubles to

229
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,389
Just an hour ago

230
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,825
You listened to their voices

231
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:14,388
Lilting like a river over underground

232
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,060
And the light from downstairs

233
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,399
Came up soft like daybreak

234
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:24,340
Dimly as the heartache of a lonely child

235
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:29,504
And if you can't remember a better time

236
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:33,984
You can have mine, little one...

237
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,047
Say the word,
and I'll call Child Protective Services.

238
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:40,683
- He says she'll be home soon.
- Which was three hours ago.

239
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:44,395
I just want to make sure that he...

240
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,338
- Annie Balic?
- Yeah?

241
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:02,178
I'm Colonel Telford.
I'm a friend of Matthew Scott's.

242
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,716
- Is he okay?
- Yeah, he's fine.

243
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:08,309
He's on a mission. It's classified.

244
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:12,356
I can't say where, but he got your letter.

245
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,887
It said you needed to see him?

246
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,198
Have you seen your parents?

247
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,326
No point. They're not cleared.
I can't tell them who I really am.

248
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,505
You can tell them
that their daughter's okay.

249
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:32,602
You can tell them that
she misses them and she loves them.

250
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,077
- Go see them.
- Mmm.

251
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:41,375
- Oh, um, I tried to sell that. I did.
- Mmm-hmm. Right.

252
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,079
- I really...
- Yeah.

253
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:46,214
Come here.

254
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:50,318
It's so strange, this other body.

255
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:54,397
Food doesn't taste quite right. Wine either.

256
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:56,790
Oh.

257
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:01,738
Now this... This feels right.

258
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:11,372
- So much for retiring to our beach.
- None of that right now.

259
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:18,784
Forgot the rowboat.

260
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,114
SHARON: Hmm?

261
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,990
Why did I forget the rowboat?

262
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,164
Hey, come here.

263
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,808
Come here. Come on.

264
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:47,482
Come here.

265
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:51,720
It's okay.

266
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,819
- Hey, Dr. Rush, you got a sec?
- No.

267
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,919
I'm doing psych evaluations,
the entire crew.

268
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,554
- No, thank you.
- Colonel Young ordered them.

269
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,462
It's just a talk, see how you're doing,

270
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:04,832
give you a chance
to voice any problems or frustrations.

271
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:08,868
I'm fine. No problems, no complaints.
Is that it?

272
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,366
Yeah.

273
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,071
He's usually not this shy.

274
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,385
It must be the uniform.
He loves the military.

275
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,087
Did you eat?

276
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,187
Go brush your teeth.

277
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,294
Matthew, go.

278
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,038
Is Lieutenant Scott...

279
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:50,641
I don't know how good of a friend you are
or what he might have told you about us...

280
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,944
He said there was a pregnancy,
but that you were gonna...

281
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:56,248
I couldn't. I couldn't go through with it.

282
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,223
Why didn't you tell him?

283
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:01,551
I didn't want to burden him.

284
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,686
He was dealing with a lot of stuff
at the time.

285
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:25,974
Whoa!

286
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,283
What is it?

287
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,087
Now, that's good.

288
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:42,930
Look, there's a bad guy out there,
put a gun in my hand, I'll go kill him.

289
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:44,935
Not gonna lose any sleep over it.

290
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:49,133
Your ass needs saving, I'm gonna save it
or I'm gonna die trying.

291
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:53,735
I didn't ask to be like this.
Nobody made me this way.

292
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:57,508
You want to riff about my childhood?

293
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,381
How my daddy beat my ass,

294
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:05,320
really, really messed me up?

295
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:12,324
What, you think you can understand me?

296
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:16,094
- No, I just want to talk.
- I wish people would just shut up.

297
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:19,295
Be happy for what I am.

298
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:21,031
People?

299
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:26,204
People less willing or able to do what I do.

300
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:30,339
He fought in Desert Storm, didn't he?

301
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:35,876
- Your dad?
- I'm not talking about him.

302
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:39,252
You're the one who brought him up.
What was he like?

303
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:57,735
My mom used to baby-sit him after school.

304
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:00,871
This is her house.

305
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:04,344
She died last summer.

306
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:10,252
This new job, though, insane hours,
but the money's really good,

307
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:12,823
so I should be able
to hire a sitter real soon.

308
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:14,118
Oh, what's the job?

309
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:18,890
I dance.

310
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:28,297
Matt said something about
you going to college, becoming a lawyer?

311
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:32,072
Yeah. That was then, right?

312
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:42,249
It's time.

313
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:49,952
Hey, I need to use your cell phone.
Real quick.

314
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,888
Thanks. Okay. I'll be right back.

315
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,658
- Sorry.
- Be right there.

316
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:02,603
Come here.

317
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:10,378
You are gonna take a deep breath,
and you're gonna find the strength, okay?

318
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:12,640
You're gonna go back to that ship,

319
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,651
and you are gonna
work with those people.

320
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:18,883
Motivate them, do whatever
you need to do to get yourself back home.

321
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:24,424
Because I'm gonna be here.
I'm not going anywhere.

322
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:28,466
- Promise?
- I already did that 12 years ago.

323
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,534
The only thing that won't be here
when you get back

324
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,402
will be that stupid chair over there.

325
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,248
I love you, too.

326
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,555
- Be right here.
- Mmm-hmm.

327
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:24,146
Okay, okay. So they just patched me
through to Matt, and I told him.

328
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:28,091
He was angry, wasn't he?

329
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:31,552
He's gonna need some time.

330
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:36,760
It's a lot to take in right now,
but, anyway, long story short,

331
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:40,463
the mission that he's on right now
takes care of him financially,

332
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:44,668
so he's gonna arrange to have
his monthly Air Force check

333
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:47,574
directly deposited into your bank account.

334
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,749
- Really?
- Yeah, that way you can quit your job,

335
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:59,153
you can go back to school
and follow through with your dreams...

336
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:00,747
Wait a minute.

337
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,194
If Matt wants to help us out, that's great,

338
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:11,659
but I'm okay with my job.

339
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:14,500
Wait, what about college?

340
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:16,699
Me, a lawyer?
Yeah, like that was ever going to happen.

341
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:18,036
Did you even try?

342
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:22,842
Tell Matt thanks,
but I've got things under control here.

343
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:26,883
He doesn't have to worry about us.

344
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:51,707
I told you it wouldn't take long.

345
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:58,371
I've been able to access the subspace link
between Destiny and the unmanned ships

346
00:26:58,483 --> 00:26:59,609
that were sent out ahead of it.

347
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:01,242
The ones seeding these stargates
on planets.

348
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:03,048
Yeah. We now have data

349
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:05,520
on literally thousands of gates
that have already been seeded.

350
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,387
I've only managed to
get through a fraction of it,

351
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:10,427
but I found something quite interesting.

352
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:18,528
Almost the same mineral composition
as the Icarus planet.

353
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,832
- How long?
- One year away.

354
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,632
Naturally-occurring naquadria
throughout the planet's crust.

355
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:26,472
Ample power for our needs.

356
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:28,637
One more year, we can gate back home?

357
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,048
It's not quite as simple as that.

358
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:35,415
- We have to learn how to steer the ship...
- How to orbit the planet.

359
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,818
BRODY: Not to mention how to make
the gate work to dial home from there...

360
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:39,253
Yes, as I said, much to be done,

361
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:42,349
but we will, of course,
need the master code.

362
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,087
Then you better get to work cracking it.

363
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:47,323
Sounds like
you've got the better part of a year.

364
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:52,733
- But the neural-interface device...
- Is still off-limits.

365
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:55,533
God, you think
I don't know what you're doing here?

366
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,473
Crack the damn code, Rush.
That's your job.

367
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:11,014
- Hey, how did it go?
- Great.

368
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:14,352
And you?

369
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,655
Great.

370
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:28,398
- One year, and we're out of here?
- First we have to do what's necessary.

371
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:29,996
Then get to it.

372
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:35,512
I will, but we'll need your support,
shall we say.

373
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:42,750
Look, if it means getting off of this tin can,
then we're all in.

374
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:44,822
I can't wait another year.

375
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:50,560
- I want off this ship now.
- Chill out, Spencer.

376
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:54,055
A year is a hell of a lot better than forever.

377
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:05,405
That is much better.

378
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:09,478
We'll crack it. I know we will.

379
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:13,107
If we can't, I know that Colonel Young
will give us access to the chair.

380
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:15,345
He has to. A chance like this?

381
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:17,821
This is our ticket home.

382
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,049
The word's getting around.
I mean, everyone's really excited.

383
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:22,058
Hell, yeah.
It was good timing, too,

384
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:27,029
because I don't know about you, but I was
getting to the end of my rope here.

385
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:58,123
It's weird. I've never even met your wife.

386
00:29:58,862 --> 00:30:01,956
I only saw that one picture
you had in your office at Icarus.

387
00:30:02,065 --> 00:30:04,158
Telford, you connected with him.

388
00:30:06,203 --> 00:30:07,500
So, what?

389
00:30:08,438 --> 00:30:12,932
This is a residual memory of his that
somehow transferred to my subconscious?

390
00:30:16,446 --> 00:30:20,212
Doesn't mean it was an actual memory.
It could've been one of his dreams.

391
00:30:21,451 --> 00:30:24,852
I mean, just because I saw her
doesn't mean the two...

392
00:30:24,955 --> 00:30:27,219
No. Thanks.

393
00:30:39,036 --> 00:30:40,970
- JOHANSEN: Camile! Hi.
- T.J.

394
00:30:41,071 --> 00:30:44,063
Dr. Boone told me about a planet
Rush discovered in the database.

395
00:30:44,174 --> 00:30:46,506
- Is it true?
- Yeah, finally some good news.

396
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:48,202
I hope it pans out the way he says it will.

397
00:30:48,312 --> 00:30:49,870
Yeah, so, listen, while you were gone,

398
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,710
Colonel Young asked me to do
psych evaluations on the entire crew,

399
00:30:52,816 --> 00:30:54,511
assess people's state of mind,

400
00:30:54,618 --> 00:30:56,950
any red flags
that we might need to be aware of.

401
00:30:57,054 --> 00:30:58,487
Yeah, that's a good idea.

402
00:30:58,589 --> 00:31:00,580
Yeah, so I was just kind of wondering

403
00:31:00,691 --> 00:31:04,024
if you had some time
to maybe sit down and talk to me?

404
00:31:04,294 --> 00:31:08,492
Oh. Right. No problem. But, you know,
I have some things I need to do today.

405
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:12,091
- Is tomorrow okay?
- Yeah, okay. Tomorrow's good.

406
00:31:16,974 --> 00:31:18,498
- Sorry.
- Watch where you're going.

407
00:31:18,609 --> 00:31:21,077
- Easy. I said sorry...
- Expect people to just get out of your way!

408
00:31:21,178 --> 00:31:22,167
What the hell's your problem?

409
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:24,839
My problem is fat asses like you
clogging up the hallway...

410
00:31:24,948 --> 00:31:27,007
- YOUNG: I've had it with you, man.
- What did I do?

411
00:31:27,117 --> 00:31:28,778
Listen to me, I don't know
what the hell your problem is,

412
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:30,012
but you better get it together fast!

413
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,815
- He ran into me!
- Shut up!

414
00:31:31,922 --> 00:31:33,549
I don't care who ran into who!

415
00:31:33,657 --> 00:31:35,852
You keep pulling this crap,
I'm gonna lock you up for good.

416
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:37,483
You got that?

417
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:44,060
Get out of here. Take a walk.

418
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:00,776
A son?

419
00:32:03,053 --> 00:32:05,886
Wow. That is...

420
00:32:08,292 --> 00:32:10,760
- It's wild.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

421
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:17,159
- What's his name?
- Matthew.

422
00:32:20,404 --> 00:32:23,498
I got an eight-year-old kid named after me.
How weird is that?

423
00:32:28,211 --> 00:32:30,736
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

424
00:32:31,648 --> 00:32:34,446
It's a lot to deal with.

425
00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:41,524
Angry that she didn't tell me,
that I couldn't be there for him.

426
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,987
Look, one more year,

427
00:32:45,095 --> 00:32:49,657
and then you can take him
to soccer games and Little League.

428
00:32:55,539 --> 00:32:57,404
What's the mother like?

429
00:33:00,277 --> 00:33:02,040
She's got her issues.

430
00:33:02,813 --> 00:33:06,078
- You two were close?
- Not really.

431
00:33:07,818 --> 00:33:11,618
Yeah. I mean, for a short time,
but things happened.

432
00:33:11,722 --> 00:33:13,189
We lost touch.

433
00:33:14,725 --> 00:33:16,056
Until now.

434
00:34:09,579 --> 00:34:10,603
What the hell are you doing, airman?

435
00:34:10,714 --> 00:34:13,649
You stay away from my wife,
you pathetic piece of scum!

436
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,183
- You keep your finger out of my face.
- What? Everett?

437
00:34:15,285 --> 00:34:16,377
This is how you get back at me?

438
00:34:16,486 --> 00:34:18,420
Pretend to be me,
crawl into bed with my wife?

439
00:34:18,522 --> 00:34:22,515
No! He didn't pretend to be you.
He never pretended to be you.

440
00:34:22,626 --> 00:34:24,651
He told me who he was all along.

441
00:34:24,761 --> 00:34:28,595
And I didn't sleep with him, by the way,
but thanks for not jumping to conclusions.

442
00:34:28,698 --> 00:34:31,724
He's a friend.
He's helping support me through this.

443
00:34:31,835 --> 00:34:33,530
What, really? Is that right?

444
00:34:33,637 --> 00:34:35,696
Not all men are like you.

445
00:34:36,339 --> 00:34:38,864
And I know you're still sleeping with her.

446
00:34:39,509 --> 00:34:41,272
Did he tell you this?

447
00:34:44,181 --> 00:34:45,375
Everett!

448
00:34:49,486 --> 00:34:51,954
What happened? What just happened?

449
00:34:54,925 --> 00:34:57,223
The connection
must have been severed, Colonel.

450
00:34:57,327 --> 00:35:00,057
- I don't know why...
- Are you kidding me?

451
00:35:02,732 --> 00:35:04,165
- SCOTT: Colonel Young...
- Not now.

452
00:35:04,267 --> 00:35:06,064
Eli was just checking
the planetary database.

453
00:35:06,169 --> 00:35:09,161
The subspace link from the ships
that are seeding the gates?

454
00:35:09,272 --> 00:35:12,002
I came across something
that didn't quite fit with the coordinates

455
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:13,201
that were established on a previous...

456
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:15,642
- Can't this wait?
- No, sir, it can't.

457
00:35:16,246 --> 00:35:17,577
Rush lied.

458
00:35:21,518 --> 00:35:24,510
The Icarus planet
that he discovered a year away?

459
00:35:24,955 --> 00:35:27,753
It doesn't exist. It's fake data.

460
00:35:29,292 --> 00:35:31,123
He planted it himself.

461
00:35:44,708 --> 00:35:46,608
YOUNG: You lied to these people.

462
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:49,372
- I gave them hope.
- False hope, Rush.

463
00:35:49,479 --> 00:35:51,845
Yeah, well, so was dialing Earth.

464
00:35:51,948 --> 00:35:54,542
I knew it was pointless at the time,
but you persisted.

465
00:35:54,651 --> 00:35:56,846
Why? To boost morale.

466
00:35:58,388 --> 00:36:00,856
- You tell me the difference.
- I'll tell you the difference. One is a lie.

467
00:36:00,957 --> 00:36:02,254
Who cares?

468
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,957
Who else knows about this, then?

469
00:36:05,061 --> 00:36:07,825
Wray overheard, so we can assume
everyone knows on the ship.

470
00:36:07,931 --> 00:36:09,125
Well done, Colonel.

471
00:36:09,232 --> 00:36:11,427
You've just ruined the chance
to maximize productivity.

472
00:36:11,535 --> 00:36:13,526
I wasn't the one
who planted false information.

473
00:36:13,637 --> 00:36:16,538
There may very well be
an Icarus-type planet buried in the data.

474
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,073
There may very well be.

475
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:20,370
I've only begun to scratch the surface,

476
00:36:20,477 --> 00:36:22,411
but I'd be a lot further on
if you would just let me use...

477
00:36:22,512 --> 00:36:24,070
- Again, with the chair!
- Yes, the chair!

478
00:36:24,181 --> 00:36:27,116
- It could be our salvation...
- And it could kill somebody!

479
00:36:27,217 --> 00:36:31,244
A sacrifice that could save the lives
of everyone else on this ship.

480
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:37,690
I'm not stopping you, Rush.
Go, sit, be my guest.

481
00:36:47,337 --> 00:36:49,202
That's what I thought.

482
00:37:03,753 --> 00:37:04,845
Hey.

483
00:37:06,823 --> 00:37:07,847
Hey.

484
00:37:08,925 --> 00:37:10,654
You hiding out, too?

485
00:37:11,695 --> 00:37:15,392
T.J.'s doing her psych evals.
I've been trying to avoid her.

486
00:37:15,899 --> 00:37:16,957
Why?

487
00:37:19,469 --> 00:37:20,766
You start opening up,

488
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:24,738
you end up saying all sorts of
personal stuff you probably shouldn't,

489
00:37:24,841 --> 00:37:26,570
and then you have to
live with these people,

490
00:37:26,676 --> 00:37:28,200
see them every day,

491
00:37:28,311 --> 00:37:31,803
have her give you weird looks
as she passes you in the hall...

492
00:37:32,515 --> 00:37:33,880
Gets awkward.

493
00:37:42,092 --> 00:37:44,219
Chloe tells me you're a dad.

494
00:37:44,794 --> 00:37:47,922
Congrats. Got yourself a mini-Matt.

495
00:37:53,403 --> 00:37:55,462
See, that's what I'm talking about.

496
00:37:55,872 --> 00:38:00,036
I speak, and say things I shouldn't,
and I talk before I think...

497
00:38:00,143 --> 00:38:02,168
- It's okay.
- No, no.

498
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:04,577
Look at you, you're bummed.

499
00:38:05,982 --> 00:38:08,212
You just found out that you have a son,

500
00:38:08,318 --> 00:38:11,344
but now he's probably not ever gonna
get the chance to actually meet you,

501
00:38:11,454 --> 00:38:14,116
and that sucks.

502
00:38:14,758 --> 00:38:17,158
You don't want to talk about that.

503
00:38:20,797 --> 00:38:22,458
I'm gonna go now.

504
00:39:07,277 --> 00:39:09,177
I've completed 14 psych evals.

505
00:39:09,279 --> 00:39:12,942
I have eight more scheduled, and I think
the rest of the ship's avoiding me.

506
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,147
- What's wrong?
- Bad day.

507
00:39:22,258 --> 00:39:24,317
A lot of those lately, huh?

508
00:39:28,998 --> 00:39:30,700
Hey, something else is bothering you.

509
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:31,598
Hey, something else is bothering you.

510
00:39:35,405 --> 00:39:36,895
What happened?

511
00:39:37,741 --> 00:39:39,436
This my psych eval?

512
00:39:41,978 --> 00:39:43,275
It can be.

513
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:49,179
Come on, talk to me.

514
00:39:59,429 --> 00:40:00,657
Bad day.

515
00:40:15,311 --> 00:40:18,007
PETERSON: Dr. Volker?
AIRMAN: Yes.

516
00:40:19,015 --> 00:40:20,846
Welcome to Earth. I'm Major Peterson.

517
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:24,442
I've got a car waiting for you,
anywhere you want to go.

518
00:41:05,295 --> 00:41:11,564
Though these wounds have seen no wars

519
00:41:12,535 --> 00:41:18,064
Except for the scars I have ignored

520
00:41:19,909 --> 00:41:23,640
And this endless crutch

521
00:41:23,746 --> 00:41:28,843
Well, it's never enough

522
00:41:28,952 --> 00:41:35,721
It's been the worst day since yesterday

523
00:41:37,026 --> 00:41:39,790
Hell says hello

524
00:41:39,896 --> 00:41:43,855
Well, it's time I should go

525
00:41:43,967 --> 00:41:50,839
To pastures green that I've yet to see

526
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:57,869
Hurry back to me, my wild Colleen

527
00:41:59,549 --> 00:42:05,579
It's been the worst day since yesterday

528
00:42:06,856 --> 00:42:13,284
It's been the worst day since yesterday

529
00:42:14,163 --> 00:42:20,830
It's been the worst day since yesterday

530
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:31,830
