1
00:00:02,015 --> 00:00:05,507
<i>This is what Destiny intended from
the moment it entered the star system.</i>

2
00:00:05,585 --> 00:00:08,713
<i>That ship is the best chance
we have of getting home.</i>

3
00:00:08,989 --> 00:00:10,081
Are we done?

4
00:00:10,156 --> 00:00:11,453
We'll never be done.

5
00:00:12,325 --> 00:00:14,054
<i>You shouldn't have left him
on the planet.</i>

6
00:00:14,127 --> 00:00:15,560
<i>You think I don't know that?</i>

7
00:00:15,896 --> 00:00:19,332
<i>Everyone thinks we're safe.
They think that they'll never find us again.</i>

8
00:00:19,766 --> 00:00:21,563
Why did you take
one of our people prisoner?

9
00:00:23,169 --> 00:00:24,636
<i>We're not safe, are we?</i>

10
00:00:24,704 --> 00:00:26,569
They're coming!
- Who's coming?

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,301
<i>Lucian Alliance.
They're coming to take Destiny.</i>

12
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,309
<i>There's only one way
this is going to end if we wait.</i>

13
00:00:30,377 --> 00:00:31,844
<i>I'm not
surrendering this ship.</i>

14
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,474
What if we can increase
the FTL drive's efficiency?

15
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:37,073
- Who's the best?
Amanda Perry.

16
00:00:37,318 --> 00:00:39,183
<i>- Nick...
For all her abilities,</i>

17
00:00:39,654 --> 00:00:42,054
<i>there are certain disabilities
of which you should be made aware.</i>

18
00:00:42,256 --> 00:00:44,383
<i>This ship is affecting
the crew's dreams?</i>

19
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:45,789
<i>But what if this is a test?</i>

20
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,020
<i>A test he's failing.</i>

21
00:00:47,094 --> 00:00:48,288
<i>I'd like to offer my help.</i>

22
00:00:48,362 --> 00:00:51,229
<i>I spent over a year studying Ancient
systems to prepare for the trip.</i>

23
00:00:51,933 --> 00:00:55,096
We can't spend the rest of our days
here on this ship as prisoners.

24
00:00:55,303 --> 00:00:57,134
<i>Should have thought about
that before you attacked us.</i>

25
00:00:57,204 --> 00:00:58,762
I may be on the verge

26
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:01,467
<i>of discovering the true nature
of Destiny's mission.</i>

27
00:01:13,721 --> 00:01:15,746
<i>Colonel Young.</i>

28
00:01:19,927 --> 00:01:21,189
Yeah.

29
00:01:21,262 --> 00:01:23,321
<i>Morning briefing. You're late.</i>

30
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:37,545
She's been the most cooperative
of all the Lucian Alliance members.

31
00:01:37,946 --> 00:01:40,574
Homeworld Security
wants to talk to her now.

32
00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:42,674
About the planned attack on Earth?

33
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:45,345
Some of Ginn's people,
a clan from her home planet,

34
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,944
are believed to be the ones behind it.

35
00:01:47,923 --> 00:01:50,357
She may know the location of their base.

36
00:01:50,425 --> 00:01:53,394
Or at least point us to the people
who do know.

37
00:02:00,535 --> 00:02:01,797
Okay.

38
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,749
Is she in there?

39
00:02:17,185 --> 00:02:19,585
Yeah. But you should know she's...

40
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,755
Hello, Ginn.

41
00:02:24,393 --> 00:02:26,918
Our people on Earth
have asked if you could use

42
00:02:26,995 --> 00:02:29,225
the communication stones
to come and talk with them.

43
00:02:29,798 --> 00:02:32,596
Oh. Um, sure.

44
00:02:33,336 --> 00:02:34,826
I'm sorry, did I interrupt something?

45
00:02:35,338 --> 00:02:40,469
No. I, uh, was just, um, sleeping.

46
00:02:43,513 --> 00:02:46,448
Anyway, they were hoping
to talk to you this afternoon,

47
00:02:46,516 --> 00:02:47,813
if that's all right with you.

48
00:02:47,884 --> 00:02:49,374
- Sure.
- Good.

49
00:02:49,452 --> 00:02:52,114
I'll come by later, fill you in on
the protocol involving the stones.

50
00:02:52,188 --> 00:02:53,246
Of course.

51
00:02:53,322 --> 00:02:54,914
Thank you.

52
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,935
Twelve hours
on the countdown clock

53
00:03:09,005 --> 00:03:10,199
but the gate's not dialing.

54
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,298
No planets in range. We tried calling Rush.

55
00:03:12,642 --> 00:03:15,133
No response, as usual.

56
00:03:16,412 --> 00:03:17,902
Rush, come in.

57
00:03:20,483 --> 00:03:21,848
Wait a minute.

58
00:03:22,852 --> 00:03:25,013
There is something out there,
straight ahead of us.

59
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:26,986
What is it?

60
00:03:27,056 --> 00:03:28,318
Some kind of ship.

61
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:29,756
Definitely not a seed ship.

62
00:03:30,093 --> 00:03:33,392
It doesn't look like the aliens
we encountered before, either.

63
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,660
New friends.

64
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:38,763
Yay.

65
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,686
Looks like
it's been through a battle.

66
00:03:59,756 --> 00:04:01,451
And got its ass kicked.

67
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:23,271
Looks deserted. Whoever was
on board must have evacuated.

68
00:04:25,282 --> 00:04:26,408
Where the hell were you?

69
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:27,711
I was working.

70
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:29,274
I want to know
what the hell you were doing.

71
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:32,516
I was busy. I'm here now.
Can we deal with the matter in hand?

72
00:04:39,264 --> 00:04:41,095
We sent over a Kino.

73
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,690
Have you found anything?

74
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:43,859
Ship's empty.

75
00:04:43,935 --> 00:04:46,563
Looks like they were in a battle,
probably abandoned ship.

76
00:04:46,638 --> 00:04:48,367
We should send over a boarding party.

77
00:04:48,773 --> 00:04:50,240
We got no shuttle.

78
00:04:50,408 --> 00:04:51,807
We could use the space suits.

79
00:04:52,477 --> 00:04:53,637
What, to just jump over?

80
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:55,770
<i>Yes. Destiny stopped
here for a reason.</i>

81
00:04:56,281 --> 00:04:59,011
Who knows what kind of data
or technology could be salvaged.

82
00:04:59,184 --> 00:05:00,344
Well, who's going to go?

83
00:05:01,986 --> 00:05:03,078
I'll go.

84
00:05:03,922 --> 00:05:05,685
Kind of risky for you to be...

85
00:05:05,757 --> 00:05:09,693
The ship is deserted. I'm the expert
in alien technology. I should go.

86
00:05:15,266 --> 00:05:17,530
You have just over
six hours of suit air,

87
00:05:17,602 --> 00:05:20,730
in case you can't get the ship's
life support online.

88
00:05:24,275 --> 00:05:26,607
All right, Colonel,
maybe I should go with him instead.

89
00:05:26,878 --> 00:05:28,743
You say that now
that I'm already in the suit?

90
00:05:28,813 --> 00:05:31,077
I'm just not sure it's such a good idea
for you to be doing this.

91
00:05:31,149 --> 00:05:32,207
The crew needs you here...

92
00:05:32,283 --> 00:05:35,845
I need to keep an eye on him.
Don't worry, Lieutenant.

93
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:38,750
I'm not going to
leave him behind.

94
00:05:45,631 --> 00:05:48,327
Rush and Young are going to go over
and check it out,

95
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,095
see if there's anything worth salvaging.

96
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:53,799
What's this?

97
00:05:53,872 --> 00:05:58,002
Oh, some equations
Rush asked me to look at.

98
00:05:59,812 --> 00:06:01,473
You understand all this?

99
00:06:06,185 --> 00:06:09,780
I'm sorry I haven't been by
as much lately.

100
00:06:10,456 --> 00:06:11,787
I've been really...

101
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,025
It's okay.

102
00:06:16,929 --> 00:06:19,261
I heard you and one
of the Lucian Alliance people

103
00:06:19,331 --> 00:06:22,266
have been working together a lot. Ginn?

104
00:06:22,735 --> 00:06:24,100
Yeah.

105
00:06:25,437 --> 00:06:26,768
Who told you?

106
00:06:27,206 --> 00:06:28,935
- Matt.
- Ah.

107
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,473
See, we were working together
on this thing,

108
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,316
the dialing from inside a star,
and I got to know her.

109
00:06:41,388 --> 00:06:43,720
And she is really...

110
00:06:44,824 --> 00:06:46,155
I don't know.

111
00:06:46,226 --> 00:06:49,923
We became friends,
and then, out of nowhere...

112
00:06:49,996 --> 00:06:51,395
Hey.

113
00:06:52,432 --> 00:06:54,127
I'm happy for you.

114
00:07:07,414 --> 00:07:09,405
<i>Okay, we're good. Open the door.</i>

115
00:07:27,867 --> 00:07:30,028
<i>Looks like the bridge is destroyed.</i>

116
00:07:43,384 --> 00:07:46,319
<i>Okay, I'm in. Line's secured.
Come on over.</i>

117
00:07:58,466 --> 00:08:00,434
<i>Destiny, we are on board the ship.</i>

118
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:02,059
Copy that.

119
00:08:38,774 --> 00:08:40,366
<i>Bulkhead's sealed.</i>

120
00:08:40,442 --> 00:08:41,807
Is there life support?

121
00:08:41,877 --> 00:08:45,335
<i>Not yet, but we have gravity,
so that is a start.</i>

122
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:48,609
<i>The place is pretty banged up.</i>

123
00:08:49,184 --> 00:08:52,585
<i>Hopefully we can find a way
to access control of the...</i>

124
00:08:56,658 --> 00:08:58,023
Colonel, you still there?

125
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,956
<i>Yeah, we're here. Is that...</i>

126
00:09:01,463 --> 00:09:02,760
<i>It is.</i>

127
00:09:02,831 --> 00:09:04,560
<i>What? What? What is it?</i>

128
00:09:04,633 --> 00:09:06,066
<i>Pods.</i>

129
00:09:06,468 --> 00:09:08,265
<i>The aliens we encountered
on the seed ship.</i>

130
00:09:08,637 --> 00:09:11,128
Maybe you should come back,
not take any chances?

131
00:09:11,506 --> 00:09:13,303
<i>Don't worry,
the pods are empty.</i>

132
00:09:13,475 --> 00:09:16,706
Well, there could be pods elsewhere
on the ship that aren't empty.

133
00:09:16,778 --> 00:09:20,145
<i>If there was anything still alive on
this ship, the Kino would've noticed it.</i>

134
00:09:24,686 --> 00:09:26,347
<i>Is that a control panel?</i>

135
00:09:58,521 --> 00:10:00,011
<i>Are you getting this?</i>

136
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,288
Uh, yeah, yeah, we got it.

137
00:10:03,993 --> 00:10:05,290
What is that, a control room?

138
00:10:05,361 --> 00:10:10,196
<i>Some kind of engineering station.
It appears to only have limited control,</i>

139
00:10:10,266 --> 00:10:12,962
<i>but I think I can seal off
some other bulkheads and...</i>

140
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:19,734
<i>We have life support.</i>

141
00:10:21,344 --> 00:10:23,642
Power's coming on in other parts
of the ship as well.

142
00:10:28,651 --> 00:10:29,845
Right.

143
00:10:30,286 --> 00:10:33,221
I'm going to try switching over
to the ship's communications.

144
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:37,888
Do you read?

145
00:10:37,961 --> 00:10:39,326
<i>Loud and clear.</i>

146
00:10:39,396 --> 00:10:41,387
Okay, I'm also going to...

147
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,303
What the hell just happened?

148
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,003
I don't know. The engines have engaged.

149
00:10:52,075 --> 00:10:53,599
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything!

150
00:10:53,677 --> 00:10:54,905
Turn them off!

151
00:10:54,978 --> 00:10:56,343
I can't from here!

152
00:11:02,786 --> 00:11:04,481
The engines have shut off on their own.

153
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:06,822
The power's nearly drained.

154
00:11:08,025 --> 00:11:12,121
<i>Doesn't matter. We're ballistic,
moving away from Destiny.</i>

155
00:11:12,195 --> 00:11:13,287
Turn us around, Rush.

156
00:11:13,363 --> 00:11:14,489
I can't.

157
00:11:14,565 --> 00:11:16,863
Navigation and propulsion
cannot be controlled from here.

158
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,036
No power at all?

159
00:11:29,112 --> 00:11:31,012
<i>Emergency reserves.</i>

160
00:11:31,081 --> 00:11:33,072
<i>The ship's systems
took too much damage.</i>

161
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,378
<i>If we can't turn
this thing around,</i>

162
00:11:34,451 --> 00:11:35,975
<i>we're going to have to
find another solution.</i>

163
00:11:36,053 --> 00:11:37,884
Well, there's not much
we can do from here.

164
00:11:37,955 --> 00:11:41,687
<i>Without control of Destiny's core
systems, we can't steer back to you.</i>

165
00:11:42,393 --> 00:11:45,453
<i>Maybe Destiny will realize there's
a problem and turn around on its own.</i>

166
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:49,022
We can't take a chance on something
that may or may not happen.

167
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,268
- What?
- I don't know.

168
00:11:56,608 --> 00:11:57,905
You tell me.

169
00:12:03,314 --> 00:12:05,305
I've been doing some work,

170
00:12:05,883 --> 00:12:09,410
<i>writing a program which would allow me
to override Destiny's autopilot</i>

171
00:12:09,921 --> 00:12:12,151
<i>and manually fire the ship's
maneuvering thrusters.</i>

172
00:12:12,223 --> 00:12:14,919
You what?
Why didn't you tell any of us?

173
00:12:15,226 --> 00:12:18,218
Because I haven't been successful
as yet. It's extremely complex.

174
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,429
<i>Destiny's command programming
is not something</i>

175
00:12:20,498 --> 00:12:21,726
that can be easily manipulated.

176
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:24,993
Okay, so fill me in. I can help with it.

177
00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:27,060
No! Uh... Well, I mean, yes, of course.

178
00:12:27,138 --> 00:12:30,232
You and the others can handle
some of it, but most of it,

179
00:12:30,308 --> 00:12:33,004
that's going to require someone
with a far greater knowledge

180
00:12:33,077 --> 00:12:34,408
of Ancient drive systems.

181
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:36,174
Someone such as...

182
00:12:39,385 --> 00:12:41,182
Amanda Perry. She could do it.

183
00:12:42,955 --> 00:12:46,254
All right, let's bring her on board.

184
00:12:46,325 --> 00:12:48,259
<i>The suits consume power
while wearing them.</i>

185
00:12:48,327 --> 00:12:50,124
<i>You might want to get out of them.</i>

186
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,704
Nice room. It's bigger than mine.

187
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,735
- What do you want?
- Can I come in?

188
00:13:12,117 --> 00:13:15,553
I hear you've been getting friendly
with some of the people on the ship.

189
00:13:20,225 --> 00:13:23,888
The problem is when you get
close to someone,

190
00:13:23,962 --> 00:13:29,161
you start letting your guard down,
and then you say things you shouldn't.

191
00:13:31,236 --> 00:13:32,965
You haven't done that, have you?

192
00:13:35,674 --> 00:13:37,141
Oh. Excuse me.

193
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:41,274
Uh, Ginn? We're all set, if you're ready.

194
00:13:43,283 --> 00:13:44,580
Ready for what?

195
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:49,110
Nothing that concerns you.

196
00:14:06,773 --> 00:14:08,934
- Are you okay with this?
- Yes.

197
00:14:09,008 --> 00:14:10,498
She's given her consent.

198
00:14:10,577 --> 00:14:13,603
She's fully aware of
the communication stones protocol.

199
00:14:15,682 --> 00:14:18,082
I'm fine, Eli. Really.

200
00:14:25,024 --> 00:14:27,219
We may need you to remain on Earth

201
00:14:27,293 --> 00:14:30,126
until Dr. Perry is finished
helping us with our problem.

202
00:14:30,196 --> 00:14:31,686
Is that all right with you?

203
00:14:34,334 --> 00:14:36,700
Just place the stone on the device
when you're ready.

204
00:14:44,712 --> 00:14:46,179
See you soon.

205
00:15:05,633 --> 00:15:07,157
Dr. Perry?

206
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,303
Camile.

207
00:15:12,473 --> 00:15:14,270
<i>Welcome aboard Destiny.</i>

208
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,801
Were they able to brief you
on our situation?

209
00:15:17,678 --> 00:15:18,804
Yes.

210
00:15:20,047 --> 00:15:21,139
Hello, Eli.

211
00:15:22,283 --> 00:15:23,477
Hi.

212
00:15:26,987 --> 00:15:29,046
How are you getting on with
those algorithms I gave you?

213
00:15:29,123 --> 00:15:30,420
<i>Slow.</i>

214
00:15:30,758 --> 00:15:31,884
And Dr. Park?

215
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:34,189
<i>She went to the engineering control
room, like you told her.</i>

216
00:15:34,261 --> 00:15:36,229
She'll radio you when she's got something,

217
00:15:36,297 --> 00:15:38,424
though she didn't look too optimistic
when she left.

218
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:40,023
Okay, how about Eli?

219
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,831
<i>Communications lab.
He's getting Dr. Perry.</i>

220
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,872
Colonel, it seems there's another
undamaged area of the ship.

221
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,150
I've pressurized it.

222
00:15:57,219 --> 00:15:58,948
Might be worth taking a look,

223
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,318
see if there's a shuttle,
escape pod, something like that.

224
00:16:03,225 --> 00:16:04,749
Keep me posted on your progress.

225
00:16:05,026 --> 00:16:06,425
Of course.

226
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:20,834
Nicholas?

227
00:16:21,843 --> 00:16:22,901
<i>Mandy?</i>

228
00:16:22,978 --> 00:16:27,039
Yes, I'm here. I can see you.
Tell me what to do.

229
00:16:27,115 --> 00:16:28,742
<i>Good, good. Is Eli with you?</i>

230
00:16:28,817 --> 00:16:30,148
Yeah, I'm here.

231
00:16:30,218 --> 00:16:32,448
<i>Good. Go help Dr. Park.</i>

232
00:16:34,022 --> 00:16:35,148
What? Why?

233
00:16:35,223 --> 00:16:37,885
<i>Because she's going to need you
far more than Dr. Perry will.</i>

234
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:40,655
All right, all right. I'm going.

235
00:16:45,001 --> 00:16:46,332
<i>Can you read this?</i>

236
00:16:46,402 --> 00:16:47,460
Yes.

237
00:16:47,737 --> 00:16:51,332
Good. This is the first of several
heuristic algorithms I need you to run.

238
00:16:51,941 --> 00:16:55,104
<i>They're crucial to discovering a way
to manually program an override</i>

239
00:16:55,177 --> 00:16:56,644
<i>to Destiny's propulsion systems.</i>

240
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:58,979
First of several?

241
00:16:59,048 --> 00:17:01,243
And you thought this wasn't
going to be any fun, huh?

242
00:17:01,317 --> 00:17:04,377
<i>Yeah, very funny, Mr. Brody.
Time is of the essence.</i>

243
00:17:15,464 --> 00:17:16,954
<i>Did you get it?</i>

244
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:19,400
Yeah, got it.

245
00:17:19,468 --> 00:17:22,232
Okay. Here's the next one.

246
00:17:26,876 --> 00:17:28,400
Rush, come in.

247
00:17:28,477 --> 00:17:29,842
<i>Yes, Colonel.</i>

248
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:33,373
There's no sign of a shuttle or escape pod,

249
00:17:33,449 --> 00:17:36,714
and if there was, they probably
used it to get the hell out of here.

250
00:17:36,953 --> 00:17:39,786
<i>I'm going to check out
a few more compartments,</i>

251
00:17:39,855 --> 00:17:42,154
then I will head back. Young out.

252
00:18:14,891 --> 00:18:16,153
<i>Nicholas?</i>

253
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,854
Yes, Mandy?

254
00:18:18,562 --> 00:18:19,961
These heuristics you gave me...

255
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,725
<i>- Do you understand them?
- I think so.</i>

256
00:18:24,034 --> 00:18:25,729
Are you asking me to go to...

257
00:18:25,802 --> 00:18:30,205
<i>Yes. Now. Please.</i>

258
00:18:38,448 --> 00:18:39,915
I'll be right back.

259
00:18:39,983 --> 00:18:41,507
Need some help with something?

260
00:18:41,585 --> 00:18:45,078
No, thanks. I'll be fine.
I'll let you know.

261
00:18:51,729 --> 00:18:52,787
We need to talk.

262
00:18:52,864 --> 00:18:54,161
I'm sorry?

263
00:18:54,499 --> 00:18:58,492
Oh, I'm not... I'm Dr. Amanda Perry.

264
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:00,971
We used the communication stones?

265
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,768
I was brought aboard to help
with the current situation...

266
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,102
Where's Ginn?

267
00:19:04,175 --> 00:19:05,802
She's on Earth.

268
00:19:06,978 --> 00:19:08,468
Look, I'm sorry, but I need to...

269
00:19:08,546 --> 00:19:10,707
- No, no, no, we're not done here.
Hey!

270
00:19:12,316 --> 00:19:14,079
Is there a problem?

271
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,754
Sergeant, I'm Dr. Amanda Perry.

272
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:19,312
I used the stones to switch with Ginn.

273
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,652
I heard.

274
00:19:22,193 --> 00:19:23,455
Welcome aboard.

275
00:19:23,528 --> 00:19:27,123
Thank you. Look, I've got quite a bit
of work to do, and, uh...

276
00:19:27,198 --> 00:19:30,395
Then, by all means,
do not let this man stop you.

277
00:19:30,468 --> 00:19:31,901
Thank you.

278
00:19:37,275 --> 00:19:38,833
Off you go now.

279
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:43,941
That way.

280
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,776
<i>- Nicholas?
- Mandy, are you there?</i>

281
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,613
<i>- Did you find it?
- Yes.</i>

282
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:04,754
<i>Rush, come in.
- Yes, I'm here.</i>

283
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:06,492
We just lost the Kino feeds.

284
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:09,592
<i>Yeah, probably out of range.
It was going to happen sooner or later.</i>

285
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,961
<i>Don't worry about it.
Just keep working.</i>

286
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:16,901
<i>- Mandy, are you still there?
- Yes, Nick.</i>

287
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:20,935
<i>Good. This is a discreet channel.
No one else on the ship can hear us.</i>

288
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:25,811
So this is the bridge.

289
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:29,449
Indeed it is.
Now we can finally get to work.

290
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:34,350
<i>- What's going on here, Nick?
- Oh, Mandy, I'm sorry for all the puzzles.</i>

291
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:37,260
I had to find a way of getting you
on the bridge without anyone else knowing.

292
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,390
<i>- Why the secrecy?
- Because I've done it.</i>

293
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,368
<i>I've broken Destiny's master code.</i>

294
00:21:43,437 --> 00:21:45,428
I now have complete control
over all its systems.

295
00:21:45,706 --> 00:21:49,039
Wait a minute. You have control
over navigation and propulsion?

296
00:21:49,143 --> 00:21:50,735
<i>Yes, all of it.</i>

297
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:52,836
Then why do you need me?

298
00:21:53,314 --> 00:21:54,872
<i>You could've had any
of these people...</i>

299
00:21:54,949 --> 00:21:58,476
I needed you because
you're the only one I can trust.

300
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:01,078
<i>I can't tell the others. Not yet.</i>

301
00:22:01,155 --> 00:22:02,850
<i>- Why not?
- Look, I'll explain in time.</i>

302
00:22:02,923 --> 00:22:06,518
<i>Right now, I need you to turn
Destiny around and come and get us.</i>

303
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:10,759
All right. Tell me what to do.

304
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,660
- We lost the Kino feed.
- Yeah, out of range.

305
00:22:17,271 --> 00:22:18,465
Where's Dr. Perry?

306
00:22:20,241 --> 00:22:21,765
I thought she was going to your lab.

307
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:25,971
<i>Dr.
Perry, do you read?</i>

308
00:22:26,814 --> 00:22:29,078
<i>Dr. Perry, please come in.</i>

309
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:30,514
<i>Where are you?</i>

310
00:22:31,085 --> 00:22:33,986
<i>- Nick, your friends are calling me.
- Don't answer. Not yet.</i>

311
00:22:46,534 --> 00:22:49,526
Uh, guys? We're changing course.

312
00:22:49,904 --> 00:22:52,930
<i>The Destiny just turned
in the direction of the alien ship.</i>

313
00:22:54,509 --> 00:22:56,409
<i>Okay, we're on our way.</i>

314
00:22:57,512 --> 00:22:59,002
Well done, well done.

315
00:22:59,114 --> 00:23:01,480
So, what am I supposed to tell the others?

316
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:03,915
Tell them I sent you
to the engine control room.

317
00:23:03,985 --> 00:23:07,216
You were able to enter
the correct programming

318
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:09,189
that allowed you to fire
the ship's maneuvering thrusters.

319
00:23:09,257 --> 00:23:10,690
You're brilliant. They'll believe you.

320
00:23:11,293 --> 00:23:12,658
What is going on here, Nick?

321
00:23:12,727 --> 00:23:14,695
Why don't you want me
to tell anyone the truth?

322
00:23:14,763 --> 00:23:17,391
Look, things have changed
since you last came aboard this ship.

323
00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:20,123
You know me better than anyone, Mandy.

324
00:23:20,201 --> 00:23:23,568
Please believe me when I say
I've got good reasons for this secrecy.

325
00:23:23,705 --> 00:23:25,400
<i>Dr. Perry, please respond.</i>

326
00:23:25,473 --> 00:23:27,338
<i>We really need to talk to you.</i>

327
00:23:30,211 --> 00:23:32,179
<i>We just need to know
that you're okay.</i>

328
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,881
Yes, Eli. I'm fine.

329
00:23:41,456 --> 00:23:43,686
<i>I am in the engine control room.</i>

330
00:23:43,758 --> 00:23:47,388
<i>I was able to execute
Dr. Rush's programming override.</i>

331
00:23:48,998 --> 00:23:52,024
Really? So you turned the ship around?

332
00:23:52,101 --> 00:23:56,003
<i>Yes. I was able to manually fire
the maneuvering thrusters.</i>

333
00:23:58,174 --> 00:24:00,506
Wow. Okay.

334
00:24:01,844 --> 00:24:03,209
Do you need any help?

335
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,213
<i>- I can come down, and...
- No, no, it's okay.</i>

336
00:24:05,281 --> 00:24:07,272
I'm, uh, almost finished here.

337
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,944
I should be coming back
to the Control Room shortly.

338
00:24:11,354 --> 00:24:12,685
All right.

339
00:24:16,258 --> 00:24:18,192
What was she doing before she left?

340
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,852
Working on the heuristics Rush gave her.

341
00:24:21,697 --> 00:24:24,359
She took her work with her.

342
00:24:36,178 --> 00:24:37,236
What?

343
00:24:37,813 --> 00:24:43,251
The Kino feed, before we lost it?
I always record everything.

344
00:24:49,593 --> 00:24:50,582
<i>Can you read this?</i>

345
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,718
<i>Yes.</i>

346
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:55,298
<i>This is the first of several heuristic
algorithms I need you to run.</i>

347
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,561
<i>Well,
so far, so good.</i>

348
00:24:59,403 --> 00:25:02,304
<i>My calculations put us at your
doorstep within the hour.</i>

349
00:25:02,372 --> 00:25:04,738
I knew it was a good idea
getting you on board the ship.

350
00:25:04,808 --> 00:25:07,333
<i>Well, you did say you'd find a way
to bring me back aboard.</i>

351
00:25:07,411 --> 00:25:09,402
I did at that.

352
00:25:34,471 --> 00:25:36,063
What the hell?

353
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,530
Mandy, who's that?

354
00:25:38,608 --> 00:25:40,235
- Rush?
I don't believe this.

355
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,835
<i>- You cracked Destiny's master code?
Eli, listen to me...</i>

356
00:25:42,913 --> 00:25:46,111
You've had control
of this ship the whole time?

357
00:25:46,184 --> 00:25:48,084
<i>Why... Why wouldn't you tell any...</i>

358
00:25:52,223 --> 00:25:56,956
- Look, Colonel, I had every intention of...
- You broke the code?

359
00:25:57,728 --> 00:25:59,662
- Yes.
- When?

360
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,163
- Does it matter?
- When?

361
00:26:03,568 --> 00:26:06,093
Shortly after the Lucian Alliance attack.

362
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:08,035
I wanted to tell you,
but I had to make sure I knew

363
00:26:08,105 --> 00:26:09,732
everything about this
before I let it...

364
00:26:09,807 --> 00:26:12,537
I should've killed you
when I had the chance.

365
00:26:18,115 --> 00:26:21,482
Know what, it's your fault
we lost the shuttle, that Riley's dead.

366
00:26:21,552 --> 00:26:22,610
Your fault!

367
00:26:35,566 --> 00:26:37,534
You murdered that boy!

368
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,909
So, that's it? That was your plan?
Just keep this whole thing a secret?

369
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:27,042
See how long you can get away with it?

370
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:29,178
- I had no choice.
- Yeah, you did.

371
00:27:29,254 --> 00:27:31,848
- You could've told me, Rush.
- I couldn't trust you.

372
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:36,127
I'm not the only one who feels this way.

373
00:27:37,195 --> 00:27:40,028
- Several of the crew have voiced their...
- It's all about control with you. Power...

374
00:27:40,098 --> 00:27:41,531
Well, someone's got to lead these people.

375
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,295
You think anyone's gonna
follow you after this?

376
00:27:43,368 --> 00:27:45,165
No, no, no, not me.

377
00:27:47,507 --> 00:27:48,667
But not you, either.

378
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,480
Come on, Colonel, look at yourself.

379
00:27:56,482 --> 00:27:58,040
You can hardly get out of bed
in the morning,

380
00:27:58,117 --> 00:27:59,778
never mind make command decisions.

381
00:27:59,852 --> 00:28:02,252
Wow, look at that.
You got me all figured out, don't you?

382
00:28:02,322 --> 00:28:04,552
Well, anyone can see it.
You know it's true.

383
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,623
Look, when I unlocked the code,

384
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:16,232
the amount of information
it revealed was overwhelming.

385
00:28:17,704 --> 00:28:20,036
I had to make sure I had
a proper handle on this stuff

386
00:28:20,106 --> 00:28:22,404
before letting anyone have access to it.

387
00:28:22,475 --> 00:28:24,966
If any one of those systems
had been improperly handled...

388
00:28:25,044 --> 00:28:27,706
Resulting in the shuttle crashing,
one of our best young men dying.

389
00:28:28,047 --> 00:28:29,605
You mean something like that?

390
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,081
Yeah.

391
00:28:38,825 --> 00:28:40,258
I know I made mistakes.

392
00:28:53,507 --> 00:28:55,771
The simulation the ship
just put me through,

393
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:58,438
was that your doing as well?

394
00:28:58,512 --> 00:29:00,241
No, no, no, that was... That was the ship.

395
00:29:00,881 --> 00:29:02,007
Except the part at the end.

396
00:29:03,851 --> 00:29:08,220
<i>I had to override the program
to make Destiny jump back into FTL.</i>

397
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:10,886
Look, with all that's happened recently,

398
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:15,486
the Lucian Alliance trying to take the
ship, lives lost as a result of that,

399
00:29:18,132 --> 00:29:19,861
Lieutenant Johansen's baby...

400
00:29:24,371 --> 00:29:28,603
It's a heavy burden to carry, I know, but
you have to ask yourself this question...

401
00:29:29,176 --> 00:29:31,838
"Am I fit to lead these people?"

402
00:29:32,846 --> 00:29:37,112
Well, maybe at one time, yeah,
but not now.

403
00:29:38,786 --> 00:29:41,084
I couldn't tell you about
the code, Colonel.

404
00:29:41,455 --> 00:29:44,117
How can I trust you
when you don't even trust yourself?

405
00:29:51,366 --> 00:29:54,824
Rush, are you there? Rush, come in.

406
00:29:56,304 --> 00:29:57,669
Out of range?

407
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,264
Probably shut off the radio.

408
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:02,475
Why didn't you tell us?

409
00:30:04,913 --> 00:30:07,780
I'm sorry. I should have, I know.

410
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:11,448
He was just so emphatic
about me keeping quiet.

411
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:13,214
He said there was a good reason.

412
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:16,357
Well, at least we're heading
towards them now, right?

413
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:20,286
If Rush is still alive when we get there.

414
00:30:23,364 --> 00:30:24,592
So, what happens now?

415
00:30:24,666 --> 00:30:27,396
<i>Well, Destiny picks us up,
and then you tell us everything</i>

416
00:30:27,469 --> 00:30:29,903
that you've learned since
breaking the code.

417
00:30:29,971 --> 00:30:32,701
Come on, you had to know that
this game wasn't going to last forever.

418
00:30:32,774 --> 00:30:34,298
It's not a game, Colonel.

419
00:30:34,642 --> 00:30:36,701
<i>Destiny's mission requires
a level of commitment</i>

420
00:30:36,778 --> 00:30:38,871
I doubt anyone on that ship
is prepared to make.

421
00:30:38,947 --> 00:30:43,884
What mission? There is no mission
other than getting these people home.

422
00:30:43,952 --> 00:30:45,385
You're wrong.

423
00:30:46,321 --> 00:30:48,290
It was never about going home.

424
00:30:48,758 --> 00:30:51,056
It's about getting us to where we're going.

425
00:30:51,594 --> 00:30:53,562
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

426
00:30:55,498 --> 00:30:59,730
You know, these past few weeks,
I've learned so much more about the ship,

427
00:30:59,802 --> 00:31:01,463
about its mission.

428
00:31:01,537 --> 00:31:03,767
It's far more important
than we ever thought.

429
00:31:05,207 --> 00:31:06,902
Okay, let's... Let's hear it.

430
00:31:07,777 --> 00:31:11,076
Are you familiar with the cosmic
microwave background radiation?

431
00:31:11,147 --> 00:31:13,547
Noise left over from the Big Bang.

432
00:31:13,716 --> 00:31:17,243
A long time ago,
the Ancients made a discovery.

433
00:31:18,854 --> 00:31:21,084
They found evidence of a structure

434
00:31:21,157 --> 00:31:23,489
buried deep within
the background radiation.

435
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:27,757
They believed that at one time
this structure had genuine complexity...

436
00:31:28,597 --> 00:31:29,928
Coherence.

437
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,332
Therefore, it could not
have occurred naturally.

438
00:31:33,736 --> 00:31:35,795
How is that even possible?

439
00:31:35,871 --> 00:31:38,669
It's not, at least not according
to our current understanding of physics,

440
00:31:38,741 --> 00:31:41,574
nor could we even see
this structure with our technology.

441
00:31:41,644 --> 00:31:45,910
Okay, so, what are we talking about,
some kind of code? A message?

442
00:31:46,415 --> 00:31:50,113
A message, perhaps,
or a sign of intelligence

443
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,187
from the beginning of time.

444
00:31:52,255 --> 00:31:53,984
- Sent by?
- Hmm.

445
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:57,493
Well, that's the very question
they sought to answer

446
00:31:57,561 --> 00:31:59,085
<i>when they launched Destiny.</i>

447
00:31:59,162 --> 00:32:01,824
That is the mission.

448
00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:07,430
We're talking about a mystery
rooted in the foundation of reality.

449
00:32:07,504 --> 00:32:11,770
A puzzle with pieces scattered across the
length and breadth of the universe itself.

450
00:32:12,509 --> 00:32:14,602
I swear to God, Rush,
if this is another one of your hoaxes...

451
00:32:14,678 --> 00:32:19,047
Once I'd broken the code, I had access
to the ship's complete archive.

452
00:32:19,115 --> 00:32:22,050
There are thousands
of pages devoted to this,

453
00:32:22,118 --> 00:32:24,518
scientific research,
philosophical debate...

454
00:32:24,588 --> 00:32:27,386
If we don't have the technology
to see this thing,

455
00:32:27,457 --> 00:32:28,685
how the hell am I supposed to believe...

456
00:32:28,758 --> 00:32:31,249
<i>Because Destiny is not
our technology, Colonel.</i>

457
00:32:31,361 --> 00:32:34,125
The Ancients left us their data
as well as their ship.

458
00:32:34,197 --> 00:32:35,221
And you've seen this data?

459
00:32:36,933 --> 00:32:38,525
I'll show it to you.

460
00:32:40,103 --> 00:32:42,571
I don't promise you're going
to understand it, but it's there.

461
00:32:44,741 --> 00:32:46,800
Someone's got to see this mission through.

462
00:32:47,244 --> 00:32:48,939
We're here. Why not us?

463
00:32:50,348 --> 00:32:53,249
Stop saying we don't belong on that ship.

464
00:32:53,317 --> 00:32:56,115
Embrace it. Move forward,
stop looking behind us.

465
00:32:56,187 --> 00:32:58,052
I just want to get these people home.

466
00:32:58,122 --> 00:32:59,783
Well, I'm starting to think

467
00:32:59,857 --> 00:33:02,758
that seeing this mission through
may be our only chance of ever doing that.

468
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,920
- But what does that even mean?
- We're talking about a level of order

469
00:33:05,997 --> 00:33:08,295
present at the very beginning of space-time

470
00:33:08,366 --> 00:33:10,698
that goes beyond anything
we ever conceived.

471
00:33:11,636 --> 00:33:15,663
<i>I believe that the more we learn,
the more pieces Destiny uncovers,</i>

472
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,271
then the greater our power
to control everything around us will be.

473
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,905
- So it is about power.
- Yes, Colonel.

474
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,904
The power to change things,

475
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:28,044
control our fate, right the wrongs.

476
00:33:28,819 --> 00:33:30,116
- To play God?
- No...

477
00:33:31,022 --> 00:33:32,887
To gain greater understanding...

478
00:33:32,957 --> 00:33:36,051
- What the hell do you want from me?
- I want you to work with me,

479
00:33:36,761 --> 00:33:40,128
together, side by side,
for the benefit of everyone.

480
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:45,830
Well, it'd be a hell of lot easier
if you stopped keeping secrets.

481
00:33:47,004 --> 00:33:49,974
It's fair to say we've had our differences,
but that ends today.

482
00:33:52,945 --> 00:33:54,242
You have my word.

483
00:33:55,013 --> 00:33:58,505
Oh, man, you are a lot of work.

484
00:34:05,023 --> 00:34:08,254
Radio. Radio, let's go.

485
00:34:10,595 --> 00:34:11,789
<i>Mandy?</i>

486
00:34:11,863 --> 00:34:13,990
Yes, Nick, we're here. What happened?

487
00:34:14,066 --> 00:34:16,034
<i>No, we're fine,
but your angle and speed are off.</i>

488
00:34:16,101 --> 00:34:20,003
<i>I need you to circle back, line up Destiny's
airlock as close to the ship as possible.</i>

489
00:34:20,372 --> 00:34:21,566
Where's Colonel Young?

490
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,938
<i>Eli, I'm here. We're going to sort
all of this out later.</i>

491
00:34:24,009 --> 00:34:25,374
<i>Let's just get us
back on board first.</i>

492
00:34:25,844 --> 00:34:27,243
We should get back in the suits.

493
00:34:36,355 --> 00:34:39,085
- Try not to come in so sharply.
- Yeah, you just want to pull alongside.

494
00:34:39,157 --> 00:34:40,181
Maybe Brody should be driving.
No offense...

495
00:34:40,258 --> 00:34:41,885
- Just shut up!
- Okay.

496
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:52,137
- Easy, easy.
- Keep an eye on your starboard.

497
00:34:52,205 --> 00:34:54,070
- Watch your angle...
What the hell's going on here?

498
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,471
No time. There's no time.

499
00:34:55,541 --> 00:34:57,099
You've got to ease up.
That's very sensitive.

500
00:34:57,176 --> 00:34:58,905
Back off as you come in...
- Is she flying the ship?

501
00:34:58,978 --> 00:35:00,309
- Do you know what you're doing?
- Guys!

502
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,369
Not now!

503
00:35:05,985 --> 00:35:08,283
<i>Kino's damaged.</i>

504
00:35:08,354 --> 00:35:10,982
<i>I won't be able to use it
to take us back to the ship.</i>

505
00:35:11,824 --> 00:35:15,487
<i>Well, there's another one in search
mode somewhere still on the ship.</i>

506
00:35:15,561 --> 00:35:17,153
<i>If we can find it.</i>

507
00:35:18,931 --> 00:35:20,159
Reverse! You're too close!

508
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,928
I'm trying!

509
00:35:36,749 --> 00:35:38,046
<i>What the hell just happened?</i>

510
00:35:39,052 --> 00:35:40,781
I'm sorry, Colonel.

511
00:35:40,853 --> 00:35:43,378
We came in too close.
Maybe I should give it a try.

512
00:35:43,456 --> 00:35:44,946
No, no, no, we're okay.

513
00:35:45,491 --> 00:35:46,924
We've matched their speed.

514
00:35:47,393 --> 00:35:50,556
Yeah, but how the hell are we going
to get them off of that ship?

515
00:35:53,467 --> 00:35:55,628
<i>Nick, are you all right?</i>

516
00:35:55,702 --> 00:35:58,933
<i>I'm okay.
The rotation's slow enough.</i>

517
00:36:04,511 --> 00:36:07,571
<i>We've got a bigger problem.
The Kino is damaged.</i>

518
00:36:08,382 --> 00:36:12,148
<i>We're not going to be able
to use it to get back on the ship.</i>

519
00:36:12,219 --> 00:36:14,551
<i>- What about the other one?
It's lost...</i>

520
00:36:15,022 --> 00:36:16,080
<i>Somewhere on the ship.</i>

521
00:36:16,156 --> 00:36:17,555
They don't have time to go looking for it.

522
00:36:17,624 --> 00:36:19,592
<i>- Are you back in the space suits?
- Yeah.</i>

523
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:22,561
<i>Okay, good. So this is easy.</i>

524
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:25,594
You're just going to use the ship's
centripetal force to propel you the distance.

525
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:28,157
Easy? That ship's just not spinning,
it's wobbling.

526
00:36:28,235 --> 00:36:30,328
You'll have to calculate
each jump separately.

527
00:36:30,404 --> 00:36:32,531
The speed of rotation,
the mass of each person,

528
00:36:32,606 --> 00:36:34,096
- the angle of trajectory...
- I'm already on it.

529
00:36:34,174 --> 00:36:37,075
- Eli, if they miss the ship...
- They won't.

530
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:45,013
<i>We're making our way
to the opening in the hull.</i>

531
00:36:45,085 --> 00:36:47,815
<i>Eli, how are you coming
with the calculations?</i>

532
00:36:47,888 --> 00:36:50,379
I've got your jump worked out,
so you'll go first.

533
00:36:50,457 --> 00:36:52,892
I'm almost done with Colonel Young's.
You have to release when I say,

534
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,429
the exact moment, don't hesitate.

535
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,603
<i>Okay, I'm in position.</i>

536
00:37:03,771 --> 00:37:04,931
<i>Tell me when.</i>

537
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,467
Ready?

538
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,368
Now!

539
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:24,951
<i>Engage your mag boots!</i>

540
00:37:33,134 --> 00:37:34,999
<i>Destiny, I'm on board.</i>

541
00:37:35,069 --> 00:37:37,765
Okay. Okay, I got this.

542
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,739
Colonel, are you ready?

543
00:37:39,807 --> 00:37:41,434
<i>- Yeah.
Okay.</i>

544
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,170
Get ready to release.

545
00:37:45,914 --> 00:37:46,903
Now!

546
00:37:56,091 --> 00:37:57,922
<i>His angle is off!</i>

547
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:02,853
He jumped too early.

548
00:38:52,248 --> 00:38:56,379
It's ridiculous,
the amount of information here.

549
00:38:56,453 --> 00:38:58,751
Just keep looking for that message.

550
00:38:58,822 --> 00:39:00,915
Colonel,
we've got an opportunity ahead.

551
00:39:00,991 --> 00:39:04,927
Several planets in range.
Looks pretty good.

552
00:39:05,495 --> 00:39:08,862
All right. Let's see if this works.

553
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:33,949
Hey.

554
00:39:34,024 --> 00:39:35,252
Hi.

555
00:39:35,725 --> 00:39:37,352
Compliments of Mr. Brody's still.

556
00:39:39,129 --> 00:39:42,826
Oh, how I've missed
its lone redeeming quality.

557
00:39:48,605 --> 00:39:50,539
How's the crew?

558
00:39:51,841 --> 00:39:56,211
Angry, but the truth is out now,

559
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,942
so that can only be a good thing.

560
00:40:01,018 --> 00:40:03,111
And, uh, Colonel Young?

561
00:40:04,088 --> 00:40:07,751
I know you didn't trust him before.
Can you trust him now?

562
00:40:10,127 --> 00:40:11,389
I've got no choice.

563
00:40:14,165 --> 00:40:15,632
Here, cheers.

564
00:40:25,543 --> 00:40:27,443
I'm sorry, Mandy.

565
00:40:27,511 --> 00:40:29,172
I know I put you in a
very difficult position.

566
00:40:30,981 --> 00:40:34,382
It's okay. In fact, I'm flattered.

567
00:40:35,753 --> 00:40:38,153
Of all people, you chose to confide in me.

568
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:41,321
Well, of course.

569
00:40:43,227 --> 00:40:45,161
You're the finest person I know.

570
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:54,768
I've thought a lot about you,
about seeing you again.

571
00:40:56,608 --> 00:40:57,905
Me, too.

572
00:40:58,343 --> 00:40:59,867
This time...

573
00:41:01,213 --> 00:41:02,680
This time is different.

574
00:41:08,186 --> 00:41:10,620
Colonel Young wants to
see you on the bridge.

575
00:41:10,689 --> 00:41:11,849
Can it wait?

576
00:41:11,923 --> 00:41:14,084
No, he said to come now. It's urgent.

577
00:41:14,626 --> 00:41:15,957
I'll be back soon.

578
00:41:23,602 --> 00:41:26,537
You know, sometimes, with the stones,

579
00:41:26,605 --> 00:41:29,904
it's easy to forget
you're in another person's body.

580
00:43:27,728 --> 00:43:28,717
