00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:05,666
RUSH: Destiny.
The design is clearly Ancient.

2
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:08,135
Launched hundreds of thousands
of years ago.

3
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:09,799
SCOTT: Where the hell are we?

4
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:11,740
Several billion light years from home.

5
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:15,804
We are on a ship, but we have no idea
where we are in relation to Earth.

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,883
RUSH: This ship could be the most
important discovery mankind has made

7
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:21,112
since the stargate itself.

8
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:23,519
YOUNG: These are the wrong people
in the wrong place.

9
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:25,488
SCOTT: I've got a lot of wounded.
We need to get home.

10
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:28,356
RUSH: We barely have enough power
to operate the main systems.

11
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:31,692
This ship simply doesn't have
the capability to dial Earth.

12
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,527
RUSH: Colonel, this chair predates
those found in the Milky Way.

13
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:37,535
Rush, you want this chair to be some
kind of wonderful discovery, that's fine.

14
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:38,626
Prove it.

15
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:39,864
I didn't steal anything!

16
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,329
- What's this, huh?
- SPENCER: Those are mine!

17
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:44,205
I brought them through with me
when we evacuated!

18
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:45,478
- Sorry.
- Watch where you're going.

19
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:46,567
What the hell's your problem?

20
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,544
My problem is fat asses like you
clogging up the hallway...

21
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:52,106
Spencer, you know what?
I've had it with you!

22
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:09,332
Looks like a sweet potato.

23
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,870
That is so not going to be sweet.

24
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,101
How do you know?

25
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:18,200
Analysis we did on the planet
when we dug the first ones up,

26
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:19,573
just to make sure it was safe.

27
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:22,011
It's safe. It's safe.

28
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,464
Now, that is one sweet potato.

29
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:53,913
Really?

30
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,475
Everybody, try it! Dig in!

31
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,655
Oh, my God. I think I'm going to be sick!

32
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:09,387
It is food, people! It will keep us alive!

33
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:12,158
Becker, boil them up, mash them up,
and serve them up.

34
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,358
BECKER: Yes, sir.
GREER: Who's on KP duty?

35
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:18,466
Sergeant Spencer,
but he should have been here an hour ago.

36
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,545
Sergeant Spencer, you have KP duty,
and you are late.

37
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:36,046
Spencer, get your sorry ass out of bed!
You have KP duty!

38
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,920
I do not have time for this, Sergeant.

39
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:42,324
Let's go.

40
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:55,499
Spencer?

41
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,476
What was wrong with the old schedule?

42
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,982
I'm worried that
we may be pushing them too hard.

43
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:06,574
- It's not boot camp.
- No.

44
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,483
In boot camp you have
plenty of opportunity

45
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,453
to learn from your mistakes.

46
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,821
Colonel Young,
this is Sergeant Greer.

47
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:16,956
- Go ahead.
- I'm in Sergeant Spencer's quarters.

48
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,161
He did not show up for duty.

49
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,793
I came by to check up on him.

50
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,036
Greer, what is it?

51
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,863
GREER: He's been shot, sir.

52
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,301
He's dead.

53
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,899
When did it happen?

54
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:59,733
Rigor's set in pretty good,
but not completely, so I'd guess

55
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,838
an hour either side of 0200.

56
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,707
And no one heard the shot?

57
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,475
He chose to have his quarters
away from everybody else.

58
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,244
Based on the blood splatter on
the wall and the position of the body,

59
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,446
I'd say he was sitting on the edge
of the bed.

60
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:16,947
Suicide?

61
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:22,551
- Well...
- Why was he even allowed access to a gun?

62
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:23,651
He was a highly trained NCO...

63
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:24,787
No, he was unstable,

64
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:25,955
- and you know it.
- ...with duties that required

65
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,532
- him to be armed.
- It was required of him?

66
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:28,601
- Yes.
- GREER: Excuse me, ma'am?

67
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:29,861
You know,
I have said it from day one that...

68
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,596
It wasn't suicide.

69
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:36,134
- What are you talking about?
- Do you see a gun?

70
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,009
It was gone when I got here.

71
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:43,576
I checked the whole compartment.

72
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:46,151
Whoever did this
took the weapon with them.

73
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,024
So, any suspects?

74
00:04:57,096 --> 00:05:01,032
Well, excuse me for being blunt,
but there is a killer onboard the ship.

75
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:05,167
- Do we have any idea who did this?
- YOUNG: I don't know.

76
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:07,102
I'm still trying to wrap my head around it.

77
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:09,140
- It's unbelievable.
- RUSH: Is it?

78
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:12,077
You put ordinary people
under enough stress,

79
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,476
I think you'll find
they're capable of just about anything.

80
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,845
Add to that the fact
he was hoarding water and food,

81
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,611
involved in several confrontations.

82
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,213
I doubt you'll find
many tears shed over this man.

83
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,120
He was one of our own, Rush.

84
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,727
I'm sorry, Lieutenant, was he your friend?

85
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:34,595
Did he, in fact, have one single friend
aboard this ship?

86
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,329
James hung out with him.

87
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,670
She tolerated him.

88
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:42,206
All right, so no one could stand the guy.

89
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:44,537
Does not make it okay.

90
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,874
I didn't mean to suggest that it did.

91
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,940
What I do suggest, however,
is that Colonel Young,

92
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:53,815
you should try and find out
who this killer is as quickly as possible.

93
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,362
As I am sure many of you
have already heard,

94
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,203
Sergeant Spencer was killed last night.

95
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:21,975
He signed the weapon out of
the equipment lock-up yesterday,

96
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:25,915
and the 9mm handgun was not returned
and is still missing.

97
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:31,417
YOUNG: I'm aware of how extremely
disturbing this is for all of us,

98
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:35,525
so this is what we're going to do.

99
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,824
Lieutenant Scott, Eli, Mr. Brody,

100
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:44,000
Lieutenant James, and Dr. Park
were together playing cards in the mess

101
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,730
at the time of the murder.

102
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:48,329
They can all corroborate
each others' stories,

103
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,238
which gives them an alibi.

104
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,036
Hey, I was in the Control Room all night.

105
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,739
CAINE: I was in the hydroponics lab.

106
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,315
FISHER: Check the Kino footage!
YOUNG: Listen,

107
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:01,080
I'm sure others will have alibis,
but some of us won't.

108
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:04,656
I can tell you for a fact that I was
in my bunk, sleeping, at the time,

109
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:08,659
but I can't prove that, and that makes me
as much of a suspect as anyone.

110
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:12,322
That is why I am turning over
full control of the investigation.

111
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,626
Lieutenant...

112
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:19,034
All right. We are going to do
a room-by-room search,

113
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:22,539
starting with quarters,
until the weapon is found.

114
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:26,134
Now, everyone needs to stay here
until that search is complete,

115
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,343
- but in the meantime...
- You are not searching my room

116
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,779
without me there.

117
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:34,146
Anybody who wants to be there
when their room is being searched

118
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:36,687
can come along when their name is called.

119
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,147
That fair?

120
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:42,957
Okay, Dr. Franklin, you can be first.

121
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,724
Who else would like to be present
when their...

122
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:51,364
All right, okay, it'll take all day that way,

123
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,735
but we can do two at a time.

124
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,269
If that's what you want.

125
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,808
You two, follow me.

126
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:14,986
All right, Dr. Franklin,
stay near the hatch, please.

127
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,146
Guess I should be thankful
there's no cavity search.

128
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:38,250
That can be arranged, Franklin.

129
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,676
ELI: Hey, we don't like this
any more than you do.

130
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:43,885
Right.

131
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,395
Yeah, there's nothing here.

132
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:57,429
You can just stay here now
until the all-clear.

133
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:06,203
You know, Lieutenant, I understand
the need for a thorough investigation,

134
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:10,646
check all possibilities, but you
shouldn't lose sight of the obvious.

135
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,377
- What are you talking about?
- Sergeant Greer

136
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,885
has to be your number one suspect.

137
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:19,583
So, he killed Spencer,
ran away to hide the gun,

138
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,922
then went back and called it in?

139
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,929
Besides, if he did do it,
you'd have no evidence at all.

140
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:27,591
- Not helping your argument...
- I'm just saying,

141
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,029
he's one of the few people
we can eliminate as a suspect.

142
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,834
RUSH: Colonel Young, come in.

143
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:40,704
What is it?

144
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:45,080
I've found some new information
regarding the Ancient chair interface.

145
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,811
YOUNG: Have they checked your quarters?

146
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,717
Well, I don't know, actually.
I've got work to do.

147
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,914
- Where are you?
- The Control Interface Room.

148
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,122
Look, I've come across
some very interesting data...

149
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:57,195
You're supposed to be here,
waiting, with the rest of us.

150
00:09:57,296 --> 00:10:01,733
Colonel, obviously neither one of us
has anything to do with this business.

151
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:02,858
Well, that's not the point...

152
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,334
RUSH: I thought while this was going on,

153
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,302
it might give us the opportunity
to keep working.

154
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,464
Obviously, I was wrong. Rush out.

155
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,077
Rush, get your ass back to
the Gate Room. Rush!

156
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,044
Colonel Young,
this is Scott, come in.

157
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,683
Go ahead, Lieutenant.

158
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,811
You're up, sir. Do you want to be here, or...

159
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,413
YOUNG: No, no, you go ahead. I'll wait here.

160
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:46,737
All right, there's obviously nothing here.
Let's move on.

161
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:50,942
Eli, come on.

162
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:53,952
Uh...

163
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,250
What is it?

164
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:14,573
Colonel, this is Scott.
I need you to get down here right away.

165
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,639
Where was it?

166
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:26,648
- ELI: In the air vent.
- The vent. That's imaginative.

167
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,447
I didn't mean to look that hard.

168
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:32,581
That's okay.
I was the one who authorized the search.

169
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,989
Right.

170
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,287
You don't believe I put it there, do you?

171
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:36,986
No, sir. Of course not.

172
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:42,132
- Somebody's trying to frame me, Eli.
- Right.

173
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,600
SCOTT: Right, so this is what
I've been thinking.

174
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,172
We say that we found it in a storage room.

175
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,673
Only the person who hid it in there
will know any better.

176
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,243
Maybe we can smoke them out that way.

177
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,904
Uh... Are we sure that that's a good idea?

178
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,948
He did not kill Spencer, Eli!

179
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,040
- I'm not saying that he did...
- Look, this is obviously

180
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:00,880
someone trying to undermine
the Colonel's authority.

181
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:03,352
- We cannot let that happen.
- Eli's right.

182
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:07,557
I want you to take this gun to Wray,
tell her where and how you found it.

183
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,356
Leave nothing out. She'll know what to do.

184
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:14,524
- Sir?
- I can't investigate myself, Lieutenant,

185
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:17,329
and you can't be asked to investigate
your immediate superior officer.

186
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,995
That leaves Wray.
We got to play this by the book.

187
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:22,802
With all due respect, sir,
if the book covers this, I missed it.

188
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,240
Lieutenant, I need you to listen to me.

189
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,310
Something's going on here.

190
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,745
If we get caught in a lie now,
this is going to turn into a bigger mess

191
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,009
than it already is, right?

192
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:33,915
So I need everything above board,
out in the open.

193
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,350
That is an order.

194
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,288
RUSH: Well, this looks bad.
SCOTT: It doesn't prove anything.

195
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:48,491
WRAY: That's not the point.
This is a question of morale.

196
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:51,632
A lot of people onboard
are going to have doubts.

197
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:55,735
Eli, you were flying a Kino
in everyone's face last night.

198
00:12:56,208 --> 00:13:01,202
Just until the poker game, then...
Then I put it in search mode.

199
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:03,247
Well, maybe it caught something.

200
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:07,308
Something that might indicate that
Colonel Young had nothing to do with this.

201
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,251
Or that he did.

202
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,689
I find that hard to believe.

203
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:18,329
Have you contacted Earth yet?

204
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:22,266
I was just about to use
the communication stones.

205
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:28,767
Well, whatever your superiors advise,
we are on our own out here.

206
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,842
Best we handle this ourselves.

207
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:47,623
Thanks for coming.

208
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:56,261
I need a favor. Obviously,
you've heard about what's been going on.

209
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,131
It's pretty hard to miss.

210
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,994
I didn't do it.

211
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,102
Okay.

212
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,577
Unfortunately, it looks like
I'm going to have to clear my name

213
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,705
before I can find out who did.

214
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:11,077
I don't understand.

215
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:15,313
Wray used the stones... Please...
To talk to her IOA superiors.

216
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:19,016
She came back authorized to hold
an evidentiary hearing on the matter.

217
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:20,250
That doesn't sound so bad.

218
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,793
Don't kid yourself.
She's going to come after me.

219
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:25,159
- Why?
- Well, the IOA's been chomping at the bit

220
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:29,030
to have one of their own in charge.
This is the best shot they've got.

221
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,261
Well, you could talk to General O'Neill.

222
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,803
Miss Armstrong, I could stay in charge

223
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,772
without having to run to General O'Neill
if that's what I wanted to do.

224
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,740
This is about more than that.

225
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:41,806
The point is, if she's going to be
the de facto prosecutor,

226
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,711
I'm going to need a defense.

227
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:45,749
So...

228
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,747
- Me?
- You went to Harvard.

229
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:52,021
- Political Science.
- This is more politics than law.

230
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:54,788
I would think Lieutenant Scott, or...

231
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,591
I don't want it to seem like
the military against the civilians.

232
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,556
Please.

233
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:07,368
Doctor, have you ever seen

234
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,135
Colonel Young attack
one of his own men before?

235
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,244
I wouldn't call it an attack.

236
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,039
He was defending me.

237
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:23,086
Have you ever seen Colonel Young
have any kind of physical confrontation

238
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:24,883
- with one of his men?
- No.

239
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,525
But I'm not military.

240
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:32,759
WRAY: You did serve at Icarus Base
for a period of six months,

241
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:34,690
which was under his command.

242
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,258
Look, Spencer was out of control.
He had to do something.

243
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:39,804
Did he?

244
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,040
VOLKER: I was in the Control Room
running a test.

245
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:46,509
Colonel Young and Dr. Rush were...
Were talking.

246
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,080
I don't think they realized
that I could hear them.

247
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:50,876
WRAY: And what were they saying?

248
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:54,748
Colonel Young was complaining
about Sergeant Spencer.

249
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:59,954
Said that he had gotten out of hand,
and if the situation didn't improve,

250
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,789
he might have to take drastic measures.

251
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:05,864
But you have no way of knowing
what he meant by that, do you?

252
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,694
Assuming you heard correctly.

253
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,824
No, not at the time, I didn't.

254
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:12,028
I don't remember
the exact details of the conversation.

255
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,695
WRAY: But you do remember speaking

256
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,967
with Colonel Young
about Sergeant Spencer?

257
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,310
Well, the Colonel was doing
most of the talking.

258
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:22,107
I think he just wanted to let off steam.

259
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:25,672
Do you remember him saying
that if things didn't improve,

260
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:28,218
he was going to have to
take drastic action?

261
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,652
I'm not sure he used those exact words.

262
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:36,825
Do you agree that Sergeant Spencer
was a disruptive force,

263
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:41,423
that his attitude was damaging to morale
and was only getting worse?

264
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:43,601
Yes.

265
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:49,070
Then would you say that
his removal from the situation

266
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:53,008
has been a net benefit or a detriment?

267
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,536
I know what you're trying to do.

268
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:59,279
You want me to suggest that
we're better off without him,

269
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,421
and therefore imply that Colonel Young
may have drawn the same conclusion.

270
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:08,186
That as commander
he may have believed he had no choice.

271
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,163
Well?

272
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:15,097
Well, that would be pure speculation,
and I'm having none of it.

273
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:20,132
Didn't stop him from saying it out loud,
did it?

274
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,631
Are you sure
there's nothing in the Kino footage?

275
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:26,199
I've confirmed alibis for
half a dozen or so people,

276
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:29,178
but I haven't found anything that
helps the Colonel.

277
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,910
You found an empty bottle of sleeping pills
in Sergeant Spencer's quarters, didn't you?

278
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,716
- Yes.
- Did you know he was taking them?

279
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:42,553
I wish I had.
I might have been able to help him.

280
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:47,156
You're suggesting that he had
a dependence, and as a result,

281
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,530
that he was suffering from withdrawal?

282
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:51,426
It would explain a lot of things.

283
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,664
But you don't know that for a fact.

284
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,706
- No.
- CHLOE: Hypothetically,

285
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:59,801
if he was suffering from withdrawal,
it could have caused him anxiety,

286
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,676
- depression, even suicidal tendencies.
- Yes.

287
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:07,411
In fact, all the physical evidence...
The blood spatter, the angle of the wound,

288
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:11,080
the position of the body,
it was all consistent with suicide.

289
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,385
- Yes.
- But you're not a forensic scientist.

290
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:16,552
No, but I've seen gunshot suicides before.

291
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:21,326
And in those cases was the gun
ever absent when the body was found?

292
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,298
No, but it's obvious that
someone planted...

293
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:24,369
It's not up to you to speculate...

294
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,132
Isn't it true, Lieutenant,
that if we were on Earth,

295
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,501
there is a simple test you could do

296
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,337
to determine if Sergeant Spencer
had fired that gun?

297
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,742
I suppose we could test his hand
for powder residue,

298
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,714
and properly test the weapon
for fingerprints,

299
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:39,249
but we don't have
the necessary equipment onboard.

300
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:42,047
Is it possible that
a forensic scientist from Earth,

301
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:45,317
say, using the communication stones,
might have been helpful,

302
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,517
even without the special equipment
you're talking about?

303
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,753
- Ms. Wray...
- If we hadn't handled the weapon

304
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,295
or contaminated the crime scene...

305
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:54,797
Yeah, but whose decision was it
to have us investigate this ourselves?

306
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,767
Ms. Wray, I think
it was my turn to ask questions.

307
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,570
What are you doing?

308
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:02,164
I'm taking my turn, as we agreed.

309
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:09,713
Lieutenant, would a proper autopsy
be able to determine

310
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,511
if he was in fact
suffering from withdrawal?

311
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,609
- Yes.
- CHLOE: Expert or no expert,

312
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:18,920
without any actual forensic
equipment or facilities,

313
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:22,118
is it possible to know for certain
what really happened?

314
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,961
I don't think so.

315
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:30,065
I think it's time
that we take a short recess.

316
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,263
We'll resume in an hour. Thank you.

317
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,737
I need to talk to you, now.

318
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:49,143
What was that?
We're trying to get to the truth here.

319
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:50,380
I don't think that's even possible.

320
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:53,185
We can't afford to have an unsolved
murder hanging over our heads.

321
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:56,455
So forget about the possibility
that the Colonel is being framed

322
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:57,529
and just get this over with?

323
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:00,029
I don't think Colonel Young is
so far above reproach

324
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,565
as you seem to think he is.

325
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,897
Oh, well, you're the
Human Resources person.

326
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:05,492
You would know all about that.

327
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:08,835
In fact, you probably know more about
every person on this ship than anyone.

328
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:12,342
If we're throwing due process out
the window, who do you think did it?

329
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,105
We'll just go with that.

330
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,609
PARK: You don't think he really did it.

331
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,377
FISHER: I'm not so sure
what to think anymore.

332
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,577
VOLKER: Spencer was a menace, though,
we all know it.

333
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:25,521
I mean, maybe it's just like Rush said,
maybe he thought he had no other choice.

334
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:26,613
PARK: No, that's crazy.

335
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,455
CAINE: Well, let's face it,
how well do any of us really know the man?

336
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:33,156
She wants to gather all the evidence
she can, and then put it to a vote.

337
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:34,289
What, like a jury?

338
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,627
CHLOE: No, everyone.

339
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,204
I say we end this right now.

340
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:43,941
I say we go in there,
tell them that the party's over,

341
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,840
and get back to work! Who's with me?

342
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,416
All right, take it easy, Greer.

343
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:52,817
This is mob rule.

344
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,613
- Sergeant...
- Lieutenant.

345
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,214
This is what they used to do
to guys like me

346
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,654
for looking at white women
the wrong way.

347
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,852
Now, you think I'm going to hang back
and let this go?

348
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,031
- Am I interrupting something?
- No, sir.

349
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:10,259
At ease.

350
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:15,964
This has gone on long enough, Colonel.
We're ready to back your play.

351
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:18,042
- That won't be necessary.
- Sir?

352
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:20,611
Ms. Wray and I have already
come to an agreement.

353
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:24,307
She's going to close the investigation
for lack of evidence against me.

354
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,714
I, in return, will be stepping down.

355
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:29,150
From this moment on, she is in command.

356
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,995
I hear congratulations are in order.

357
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:49,700
Really? I was just wondering
what I've gotten myself into.

358
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:53,039
RUSH: An opportunity to do things
differently, perhaps?

359
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,075
What do you want, Nicholas?

360
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:58,107
Control over my science team,
including Eli.

361
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:00,184
But you report to me.

362
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:03,252
- Of course.
- That's it?

363
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,090
You sound surprised.

364
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,031
This is it?

365
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:22,163
- This is it.
- Not very impressive.

366
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:24,174
I mean, as far as chairs go.

367
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,267
Well, time will tell, I suppose.

368
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,803
So you sit in the chair,

369
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,974
and it downloads the secrets of
the universe into your head?

370
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,051
And then you die.

371
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:34,880
Not necessarily, Eli.

372
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:38,046
Every time it's ever been tried,
this close to death.

373
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:40,454
FRANKLIN: Who's tried it?
RUSH: General O'Neill, for one.

374
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,459
- And he survived.
- We don't have little gray aliens

375
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:44,256
- to set things right this time.
- RUSH: No, we don't,

376
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:47,821
but this is an earlier model of
that same device,

377
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,564
possibly a prototype,
built very early in their evolution.

378
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:55,729
In my experience, the 1.0 version's
usually the most buggy.

379
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,800
It's also the simplest.

380
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:02,309
Maybe it's really simple.
Maybe it just tells you how to fly the ship.

381
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:08,242
Well, I'm sure it's a bit more than that,
but your point is well made.

382
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:11,282
It's knowledge of this ship we need.

383
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:16,291
If we're to survive, or, for that matter,
get back to Earth one day,

384
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:20,462
then I'm convinced that
this chair is the only way to do that.

385
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:25,030
Maybe there's a way of choosing
what information gets downloaded.

386
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,900
Or maybe it's just a matter of
slowing down the download

387
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:28,495
so it can be cut off.

388
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,867
There's only one way to find out.

389
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:36,007
This is our priority now.

390
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,789
I don't get it.

391
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,458
If Wray admits that there's not enough
evidence against you...

392
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:56,625
Well, there may not be enough to convict,
but there's plenty to cast doubt.

393
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:59,397
If I force the issue,
we risk dividing the crew.

394
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:01,862
We can't afford that.

395
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:05,208
- These people need a real leader.
- Whether they like it or not?

396
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:09,576
- Maybe.
- Lieutenant, nobody signed up for this,

397
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,842
and I can't just assume
they're going to follow my orders,

398
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,941
and I can't rule the ship by force.

399
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:15,849
I mean, I won't.

400
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:23,186
All right. You tell us that Wray is in charge,
that is fine,

401
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:29,194
but as far as me, and Tamara,
and the enlisted personnel are concerned,

402
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:33,237
you are still our commanding officer,
and nothing is going to change that.

403
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:43,881
Still here?

404
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,212
Yeah, I got stuck with the late shift.

405
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,383
How's it coming?

406
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:54,023
It's not. We've run every Ancient systems
diagnostic we've got. Nothing.

407
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,587
Rush is trying to write a new program,
but it seems like this thing is designed

408
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:00,756
to prevent any kind of access
except through the chair itself.

409
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,857
Which would prevent an alien species

410
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:07,302
who doesn't happen to share Ancient
physiology from trying to hack in, I guess.

411
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:10,738
Maybe Rush is right.
Maybe we're close enough for it to work.

412
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:15,974
Believe me, if Rush thought it was safe,
he'd be sitting there right now.

413
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:18,675
Yeah. Maybe.

414
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:22,914
You should get some rest.

415
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:28,120
Nah. Rush is due to relieve me at 2300.
If I wasn't here, I'd never hear the end of it.

416
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,163
Maybe you could go to the mess

417
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:35,062
and get me some of
Becker's alien mashed potatoes?

418
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:38,432
- Really?
- I'm starving.

419
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:44,203
Okay. You got it.

420
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:11,400
This is Eli!
Anybody on this channel? I need help!

421
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:14,867
Eli, this is Young. What is it?

422
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,669
I have a medical emergency.
I need help now!

423
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:21,078
- What's going on?
- I don't know, yet.

424
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:22,146
ELI: Hang on.

425
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:27,942
What happened?

426
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,422
How long's he been in here?

427
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,693
I went to the mess for five minutes,
and when I got back,

428
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:46,600
he was already in the chair.

429
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:59,143
Well, the convulsions have stopped,
but he's completely unresponsive.

430
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,810
He's basically in a deep catatonic state.

431
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,013
Is there anything you can do for him?

432
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:07,956
We could try a high dose of lorazepam,
see if it'll bring him out of it,

433
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:11,825
- but I'm flying blind here.
- Do it.

434
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,063
Yes, ma'am.

435
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:28,743
How is he?

436
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,908
YOUNG: You just couldn't wait, could you?

437
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,877
Anyone who had access to that room

438
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,818
was under strict orders
not to sit in that chair.

439
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:39,753
- You knew the temptation was there.
- We were there to analyze.

440
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,519
You made sure of it by telling them
it was our only chance.

441
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:43,321
To determine the feasibility
of accessing the information...

442
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:45,453
- You wanted somebody there...
- ...without risking anyone's life!

443
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:46,928
...because you didn't have the guts
to do it yourself!

444
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:48,260
Both of you, stop!

445
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:53,069
It was under my authority,
so ultimately, it's my responsibility.

446
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,399
I know.

447
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,449
All right, we need to talk.

448
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:15,516
You've got those things running
day and night, all over the dang ship,

449
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:17,822
and you are telling me
not one of them saw something.

450
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,658
- No!
- Anything out of the ordinary.

451
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:23,222
No. I've been over it twice.
There's nothing there.

452
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:25,097
- Look again.
- Matt...

453
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:28,731
He was framed, Eli.
We are going to find out by who,

454
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:31,435
and we're going to put a stop to it.

455
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:34,804
Okay.

456
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,968
This is Brody in the Gate Room.

457
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:05,198
Go ahead.

458
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:08,312
We have an active gate
and we sent through a Kino.

459
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:12,247
Atmosphere is nominal.
Temperature is in the green.

460
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:15,909
- We're good to go.
- I'll be there in a minute.

461
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,597
Sergeant Greer.

462
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,290
Ma'am, may I have a moment
of your time?

463
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,798
I have to get down to the Gate Room.

464
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:32,495
We're ready to send a team to
the next planet.

465
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:35,964
That's actually what I wanted
to talk to you about.

466
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:38,065
I notice that myself and
a few other Marines

467
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,440
were taken off the away team duty list.

468
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:42,376
- Yes.
- May I ask why?

469
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:46,181
Call it a temporary adjustment.

470
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:50,254
You thought it was me who killed Spencer
at first, didn't you?

471
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:52,050
You were a valid suspect.

472
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:55,785
If you can't deal with that,
it's your problem, not mine.

473
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:58,987
Now, get out of my way.

474
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:04,660
Yes, ma'am.

475
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:14,674
But I'm not going anywhere.

476
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,218
WRAY: All right, it doesn't look like
there's much vegetation around the gate,

477
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,550
so you may have to widen your search.

478
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:29,193
Lieutenant James and Airman Rennie
will be providing security,

479
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,793
but you're in charge.

480
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,431
Congratulations.

481
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:38,962
Yay.

482
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,977
- Okay, what?
- I'm sorry. I should have caught it.

483
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:48,978
- What?
- You have to look close.

484
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:55,542
There's nothing there.

485
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,245
Look at the time codes.

486
00:30:58,389 --> 00:30:59,720
They don't match.

487
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,921
SCOTT: So, wait, wait, wait. What's that?

488
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,551
ELI: That is a deletion.

489
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:07,654
I wouldn't have even noticed it,
except it caused a minor glitch in the code.

490
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:09,824
It's from the exact time
that Spencer was shot.

491
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:11,265
So the Kino did pick up something.

492
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,393
It must have.

493
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:14,664
Okay, but if it's deleted,
how does that help us?

494
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:18,230
Because whoever did this was good,
but not good enough.

495
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,603
What... What they couldn't have known

496
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,841
is that I always back up the last two days
of footage on my hard drive.

497
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:27,179
- Why?
- My documentary.

498
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:31,315
I have to download it to my computer
before I can edit it.

499
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:34,016
If there's an Ancient version of
iMovie in the database,

500
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:35,558
I haven't found it.

501
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:41,921
There.

502
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:50,031
Colonel Young, go to Channel Two.

503
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:53,336
YOUNG: What is it, Lieutenant?

504
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:55,173
I've got something you need to see.

505
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:15,228
God. I tell you, if I could change one thing
about the day we escaped from Icarus,

506
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:17,925
I would've worn better shoes.

507
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:20,402
Really? Those are nice shoes.

508
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:26,702
VOLKER: Seriously, how much longer
do we have to keep this up?

509
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:28,779
There's obviously nothing here.

510
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:37,153
- What?
- Spoke too soon.

511
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,905
An alien ship? Are you sure?

512
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:00,572
That's what he said.

513
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:02,236
RUSH: How long till we jump?

514
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,080
Just over two hours.

515
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:06,411
I'm on my way.

516
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,821
- YOUNG: I was just coming to get you.
- Not now. I have to get to the planet.

517
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:13,982
YOUNG: It can wait.

518
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:16,219
Look, they found the remains
of a crashed alien ship.

519
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:19,194
There's very little time
before we jump back to FTL.

520
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:21,725
It can wait.

521
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,597
SPENCER: It's been
about a week since I ran out of pills.

522
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:28,599
Haven't slept much since.

523
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:34,408
I can't think. Everything's...

524
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:37,607
I don't know.

525
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:43,417
These people don't even realize
they're inside a big, floating coffin.

526
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:48,991
I wish I could come up with
something better to say.

527
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:54,895
I'm sorry.

528
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:05,335
The Kino kept recording, but the file must
have gotten corrupted in the transfer.

529
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:06,432
This was all I could get.

530
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,705
Well, the point is, it wasn't there
when Greer found the body,

531
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:12,806
so we know someone took it,
along with the gun.

532
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,911
Who would have the skills to
delete the file from the mainframe?

533
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:20,457
It's not that hard, really. Anyone with
a basic knowledge of the ship's computer.

534
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,083
At least a dozen people, if not more.

535
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:31,802
Colonel, I'm sorry. I...
I don't know what to say.

536
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:35,270
Obviously, we need
to rethink our situation.

537
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:36,431
Obviously.

538
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,339
We should recall the team
from the planet...

539
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:42,470
No, no, we can't do that.

540
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,242
In over a dozen planets
we haven't had a single indication

541
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:47,510
of advanced technology up until now.

542
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:52,423
This mess isn't going anywhere.

543
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:56,894
He's right. This ship could be important.
I'm going, too.

544
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,061
- If you think it's really...
- I'm not asking permission.

545
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:02,496
I'm telling you.

546
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:08,036
Let's go.

547
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:30,593
Well, it's not Ancient.
That much we've figured out.

548
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:33,664
The material, the design,
it's completely different.

549
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:37,427
It's not emitting any radiation or EM fields.
It's basically dead.

550
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:39,029
Have you been inside?

551
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,297
We've located what looks like a hatch,

552
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:41,598
but we haven't figured out how to get in.

553
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:43,901
We probably have to cut it open.

554
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:45,976
Well, how much time would that take?

555
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:47,442
More than we have.

556
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:51,879
We're pushing it as it is.
Lieutenant, let's pack it up.

557
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,075
JONES: Yes, sir.

558
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:54,879
No, just give me a couple of more minutes.

559
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,851
YOUNG: A few minutes is going to
make a difference?

560
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:58,444
Well, it might.

561
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,581
All right. I'm willing to push it, if you are.

562
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:04,126
Take your team and head back to the gate.

563
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,928
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, we'll be right behind.

564
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:12,533
Whatever you say.

565
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:25,544
You know, Volker was right.

566
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:30,649
This is unlike any other kind of alien
technology we've encountered before.

567
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:34,218
If they're indigenous to
this part of the universe,

568
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,190
they might be willing to trade.

569
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:39,525
Knowledge, information...
There has to be a way in.

570
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:41,930
I know it was you.

571
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:45,626
I'm sorry?

572
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:48,603
The files were not corrupted.

573
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,470
Kino kept recording
until you came into the room.

574
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:56,779
So, let's hear it. Let's hear
how you lie your way out of this one.

575
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:08,824
I heard the shot,

576
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:12,823
I went to investigate,

577
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:15,791
and I found him.

578
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,869
And then you decided to
frame me for murder.

579
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:22,967
That's a bit melodramatic.

580
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:29,072
Nah. I knew there wouldn't be
any real evidence against you.

581
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:34,650
The idea was to create just enough doubt
to get you to step aside.

582
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:38,355
I see. That was the idea.

583
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:42,353
Well, you're the wrong man
for the job, Colonel.

584
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:45,758
I'm sorry to have to be the one to say it,
but I think you know it's true.

585
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:47,057
Do I?

586
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,491
You don't believe in the mission.

587
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,267
You resigned your position as SG leader

588
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:56,737
because you didn't want to
make the hard decisions.

589
00:37:57,508 --> 00:38:00,272
The life and death decisions.

590
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:04,772
Well, that makes you a liability.

591
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,713
I'm not proud of what I did,

592
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:11,578
but I did it for
the benefit of everyone onboard.

593
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:13,782
The end justifies the means?

594
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,854
Yeah, something like that.

595
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:52,726
Are we done?

596
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:54,964
We'll never be done.

597
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,626
We shouldn't have left them there.

598
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:26,788
- What? So we could get stuck there, too?
- No one is stuck!

599
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:28,956
Not yet. How much time?

600
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:30,158
Twenty seconds.

601
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:49,609
- SCOTT: Colonel?
- Where's Rush?

602
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:51,886
He didn't make it.

603
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:09,030
YOUNG: So, we just stayed too long.
On the way back, Rush tripped himself up,

604
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:13,509
started a rock slide... I was ahead,
but I just... I barely made it through.

605
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:20,781
I just wanted you to know, Colonel,
that I've informed the crew

606
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:23,615
of the new evidence that's come to light.

607
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:27,213
Since you've been completely exonerated,
obviously you should resume your duties

608
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:29,656
- as commander.
- JOHANSEN: Tomorrow.

609
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:33,595
You need to rest.
She can be in charge one more day.

610
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:41,805
Thanks.

611
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:52,172
Eli, shut the door.

612
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:03,190
The rest of the Kino footage?

613
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:06,290
Even Scott didn't see it.

614
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:09,423
I want you to make a copy for me,
put it on this,

615
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:11,899
and then delete it from your hard drive.

616
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:17,908
Okay.

617
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,206
Anything else?

618
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,115
No.
