1
00:00:02,081 --> 00:00:05,482
<i>This is what Destiny intended from
the moment it entered the star system.</i>

2
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:08,612
<i>That ship is the best chance
we have of getting home.</i>

3
00:00:08,689 --> 00:00:09,917
Are we done?

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,252
We'll never be done.

5
00:00:12,392 --> 00:00:14,053
<i>You shouldn't have left him
on the planet.</i>

6
00:00:14,127 --> 00:00:15,754
<i>You think I don't know that?</i>

7
00:00:15,829 --> 00:00:17,297
<i>Everyone thinks we're safe.</i>

8
00:00:17,365 --> 00:00:19,526
<i>They think that they'll
never find us again.</i>

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,500
Why did you take
one of our people prisoner?

10
00:00:23,137 --> 00:00:24,570
<i>We're not safe, are we?</i>

11
00:00:24,639 --> 00:00:26,197
<i>They're coming!
Who's coming?</i>

12
00:00:26,441 --> 00:00:28,239
<i>Lucian Alliance.
They're coming to take Destiny.</i>

13
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,175
<i>There's only one way
this is going to end if we wait.</i>

14
00:00:30,245 --> 00:00:31,872
<i>I'm not
surrendering this ship.</i>

15
00:00:33,816 --> 00:00:36,377
Chloe,
what are you doing in here?

16
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,250
I don't know how I got here.

17
00:00:38,321 --> 00:00:41,586
<i>There may be something happening
to Chloe on a cellular level.</i>

18
00:00:41,658 --> 00:00:45,287
<i>Some kind of genetic manipulation
gradually changing her.</i>

19
00:00:45,362 --> 00:00:46,352
<i>What were you doing?</i>

20
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,695
<i>He wanted me to look at some
equations, see if I understood them.</i>

21
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:52,628
- Did you?
- I don't know.

22
00:00:52,903 --> 00:00:56,396
<i>So, the chair kills off
any potential alien matter inside her</i>

23
00:00:56,475 --> 00:00:58,443
<i>while leaving her human
side unaffected.</i>

24
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,068
She's breathing and her pulse is steady.

25
00:01:00,145 --> 00:01:02,443
- Did it work?
- We'll soon find out, won't we?

26
00:01:09,889 --> 00:01:15,487
I think it's, uh, right over there.
Yeah, can you see it?

27
00:01:16,597 --> 00:01:18,189
We're comin' into town.

28
00:01:20,934 --> 00:01:22,424
How can you tell?

29
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,997
Hey, it beats the hell out of our digs
in Kandahar, don't it?

30
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,503
I wouldn't miss it for the world, brother.

31
00:01:30,578 --> 00:01:33,069
Well, I appreciate it. I do.

32
00:01:33,481 --> 00:01:34,846
Cloverdale!

33
00:01:35,985 --> 00:01:37,111
Me first!

34
00:01:55,373 --> 00:01:57,637
Damn, I thought my dad might be here.

35
00:02:05,317 --> 00:02:07,148
There they are. Hey, guys!

36
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:11,348
He's coming to again!

37
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:14,416
T. J!
Just cut it off me, please!

38
00:02:14,494 --> 00:02:15,518
Try something else!

39
00:02:15,595 --> 00:02:17,426
I've tried everything in my bag.
Nothing is working.

40
00:02:18,565 --> 00:02:20,055
The best thing for him
is to keep moving.

41
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:23,030
<i>Matthew...</i>

42
00:02:24,405 --> 00:02:25,463
<i>Matthew!</i>

43
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,374
What the hell's the matter with you?

44
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,004
Sorry!

45
00:02:31,412 --> 00:02:33,175
I'm sorry, he just ran out in front of me!

46
00:02:33,247 --> 00:02:35,409
- No, I'm fine. I'm fine, I'm fine...
Thank God.

47
00:02:35,484 --> 00:02:38,351
Lucky for you.
- No, no, no, I was just being stupid.

48
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,888
Look, Mr. Brody, don't worry about it.
They bounce at this age.

49
00:02:40,956 --> 00:02:43,322
Okay. Hey, are we still on for the, uh...

50
00:02:43,392 --> 00:02:44,825
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Go, go.

51
00:02:44,894 --> 00:02:46,919
We're takin' up the whole road here, guys.

52
00:02:46,996 --> 00:02:50,056
If you wind up with any insurance issues,
Matt, I got it all on video.

53
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:52,158
I kind of wish you didn't, Eli.

54
00:02:52,235 --> 00:02:54,363
Oh, you, uh, you must be Ronald.

55
00:02:54,438 --> 00:02:56,702
Oh, Dad, sorry, this is Ron, my best man.

56
00:02:56,773 --> 00:02:57,865
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

57
00:02:57,941 --> 00:02:59,306
Oh, you call me Everett. You're family now.

58
00:02:59,376 --> 00:03:01,367
- Yes, sir.
- And this is Chloe's brother, Eli.

59
00:03:02,312 --> 00:03:03,575
Brother Elijah.

60
00:03:03,648 --> 00:03:08,051
Eli, actually, and I took myself
out of the running for best man,

61
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:09,984
because I'm creating a video
for my wedding gift.

62
00:03:10,054 --> 00:03:11,385
- Lucky for me.
- Yeah.

63
00:03:11,456 --> 00:03:14,949
- Where's Chloe?
- Uh... Something about a dress.

64
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,391
She's going to meet you at the house.

65
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:19,194
I guess I'm anxious to see her.

66
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:22,595
I'll say, nearly got yourself killed
the day before your wedding.

67
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,694
Yeah, probably would've ruined
the whole weekend, huh?

68
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:26,898
Yeah, probably,

69
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:30,602
but I guess since it looks like
you're gonna live for another day,

70
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:31,939
welcome home, Son.

71
00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:53,393
Okay, he's out again.
Guys, we can move him.

72
00:03:57,774 --> 00:03:59,799
You'll be able to help him
once we're back on the ship, right?

73
00:03:59,876 --> 00:04:01,777
We can't risk taking him aboard.
It's too dangerous.

74
00:04:01,845 --> 00:04:03,506
What?
Rush is right.

75
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:06,106
You saw how quickly the organism
spreads on contact.

76
00:04:07,084 --> 00:04:08,073
It could take over the whole ship.

77
00:04:08,152 --> 00:04:09,642
He can't stay here either.

78
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,281
Chloe. Now, ready? One, two, three.

79
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:15,787
I got you, buddy.

80
00:04:18,263 --> 00:04:20,128
Come on, come on, move your feet, Eli.
Come on.

81
00:04:20,198 --> 00:04:21,223
Okay!

82
00:04:22,201 --> 00:04:24,226
<i>I'll run ahead, contact Destiny,</i>

83
00:04:24,303 --> 00:04:25,861
try to get them to send back
medical supplies.

84
00:04:25,938 --> 00:04:27,963
If I'm fast, I'll get back
before you reach the gate, okay?

85
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,371
Yeah, yeah, good. Go.

86
00:04:30,776 --> 00:04:32,608
- Eli...
- Yeah. Whoa. Stop.

87
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:36,347
Remote. Yeah. Okay.

88
00:04:47,562 --> 00:04:49,757
Wow. Aw, this hasn't changed one bit.

89
00:04:51,867 --> 00:04:55,098
Matt is clearly moved
seeing the old homestead again.

90
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,765
- What's that?
- A temp track for the voice-over.

91
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:00,833
All good documentaries have one.

92
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,879
I'm thinking Kiefer Sutherland,
but I'm the fallback.

93
00:05:03,947 --> 00:05:06,541
Ronald, uh, make yourself at home.
Let me grab that.

94
00:05:06,616 --> 00:05:10,212
You're going to be up in Matthew's room.
You're in my room.

95
00:05:10,288 --> 00:05:13,314
I'll be fine on the couch in the den.
You're the one with the fiancée.

96
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:14,380
That's gonna be weird.

97
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:17,026
Like that'll stop you.

98
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:20,491
Okay, so, uh... So, what's the plan?

99
00:05:20,932 --> 00:05:24,891
I say... You get married,
you start a family,

100
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,331
you grow old, and die happy.

101
00:05:28,206 --> 00:05:31,176
Okay, well, I thought you guys might, uh...

102
00:05:32,245 --> 00:05:33,234
What?

103
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:35,709
I don't know, throw a party maybe?

104
00:05:37,483 --> 00:05:39,384
Was I supposed to do that?

105
00:05:40,154 --> 00:05:45,148
No, no. Yeah. No, uh, Chloe said she wanted
you all to herself tonight.

106
00:05:45,893 --> 00:05:48,691
Yeah, yeah, she said something
about wanting to catch

107
00:05:48,762 --> 00:05:50,060
the early show at the Clova.

108
00:05:50,131 --> 00:05:52,326
- Really?
- Yeah, that's what I said.

109
00:05:52,967 --> 00:05:54,491
Well, we could see a movie any night.

110
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:55,627
What are you doing right there?

111
00:05:55,704 --> 00:05:57,433
What, you don't want to see a movie
with your fiancée?

112
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,738
He'd better!

113
00:06:08,517 --> 00:06:10,110
Mmm.

114
00:06:10,921 --> 00:06:12,183
Video boy.

115
00:06:12,255 --> 00:06:15,019
Kiefer Sutherland might have somethin'
to say over here.

116
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,957
Oh, I'm so sorry
I couldn't be there to meet you.

117
00:06:24,102 --> 00:06:26,536
The train was too long
after I changed my shoes.

118
00:06:26,604 --> 00:06:27,662
Uh... Okay.

119
00:06:29,174 --> 00:06:30,903
Matt, what did you do to your arm?

120
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:32,967
Oh, I got hit by a car.

121
00:06:33,045 --> 00:06:34,774
- What?
- I'm fine.

122
00:06:35,147 --> 00:06:39,084
Hit... Are you sure?
Baby, you don't look so good.

123
00:06:39,953 --> 00:06:40,977
Matt?

124
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:44,389
Time's an issue, I get it.
What do you need?

125
00:06:44,491 --> 00:06:46,425
<i>Lieutenant Johansen's medicinals.</i>

126
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:48,553
One of everything
you can get your hands on,

127
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:52,588
but especially the alien venom.
Nothing she's tried so far has had any effect.

128
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,289
Okay.

129
00:06:55,503 --> 00:06:56,629
What else?

130
00:06:56,871 --> 00:06:58,601
<i>I want to try hydrochloric acid.</i>

131
00:06:58,673 --> 00:07:01,233
<i>We need some alcohol
from the still, clean bandages...</i>

132
00:07:02,878 --> 00:07:04,709
And whatever's appropriate
for cutting through bone.

133
00:07:06,314 --> 00:07:07,646
It's as bad as that?

134
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:11,909
<i>Yeah. Put it on Eli's Kino sled and
get it through as quickly as you can.</i>

135
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:26,266
- What happened?
- You fainted.

136
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,338
I got it on video if you want to...

137
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,737
No thanks, Eli.

138
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,068
Why the heck would I faint?

139
00:07:35,213 --> 00:07:37,546
You did just get hit by a car.

140
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,250
Ronald said you haven't eaten
all day.

141
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,178
Here.

142
00:07:43,355 --> 00:07:44,754
No, I don't think that's it, honey.

143
00:07:44,824 --> 00:07:47,191
Now, you listen to me.
You're one day away from being out of here.

144
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,990
You're fine, all right?
Go to a movie with your girlfriend.

145
00:07:50,063 --> 00:07:52,429
You enjoy yourself.
We'll leave the lights on.

146
00:07:54,234 --> 00:07:55,326
Okay?

147
00:07:57,572 --> 00:07:59,301
Oh, you're going to hate the cake.

148
00:07:59,373 --> 00:08:02,035
Would you stop worrying so much
about one day?

149
00:08:02,109 --> 00:08:03,770
Think about all the days after that.

150
00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:05,073
- Okay.
- Okay?

151
00:08:05,146 --> 00:08:06,375
Okay!

152
00:08:21,064 --> 00:08:22,053
Thank you.

153
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,263
You remember the first time we came here?

154
00:08:25,335 --> 00:08:26,325
Yeah.

155
00:08:27,805 --> 00:08:29,705
That's why we came here, isn't it?

156
00:08:30,808 --> 00:08:31,968
Yup.

157
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,217
It's so beautiful.

158
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,495
- Whoa, this is...
- What?

159
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:53,892
<i>It's like an
ocean of flowers.</i>

160
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:55,525
This doesn't look familiar to you?

161
00:08:57,204 --> 00:09:00,002
<i>It goes on forever, doesn't it?</i>

162
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:09,979
<i>Did you see that?
Yeah.</i>

163
00:09:12,287 --> 00:09:13,549
<i>Watch this.</i>

164
00:09:22,798 --> 00:09:23,958
Get out of there.

165
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:26,895
<i>Don't you just want to
run through it barefoot?</i>

166
00:09:27,537 --> 00:09:28,526
<i>Yeah.</i>

167
00:09:29,105 --> 00:09:30,595
<i>It would be so beautiful.</i>

168
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:40,776
Would you relax?

169
00:09:42,587 --> 00:09:43,713
<i>Maybe not.</i>

170
00:10:11,952 --> 00:10:12,941
I'm sorry.

171
00:10:16,925 --> 00:10:19,985
Matthew, what is wrong with you?

172
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:23,556
You don't remember any of that
actually happening?

173
00:10:24,066 --> 00:10:25,556
No. It's a movie.

174
00:10:34,911 --> 00:10:39,371
No, I'm... I'm sorry, I...
I don't know what's wrong with me.

175
00:10:41,852 --> 00:10:43,343
Can we just get out of here?

176
00:10:44,822 --> 00:10:46,619
Hang on, I left my purse.

177
00:10:55,267 --> 00:10:56,859
And what was that about?

178
00:10:56,935 --> 00:10:59,130
I have no idea.
Look, I can stall for a while,

179
00:10:59,204 --> 00:11:00,933
but you'll have to let them know
we're going to be early.

180
00:11:01,006 --> 00:11:02,269
- Okay.
- Okay, thanks.

181
00:11:02,475 --> 00:11:05,638
<i>Wake up!
You've got to wake up! Wake up.</i>

182
00:11:05,712 --> 00:11:07,077
<i>You've got to wake up!</i>

183
00:11:11,117 --> 00:11:13,780
Okay, let's unpack the supplies
and get him on the sled.

184
00:11:13,854 --> 00:11:16,482
- What did you ask for?
- Everything I could think of.

185
00:11:16,557 --> 00:11:19,253
- The venom was top of the list.
- All right, I'll try it first.

186
00:11:19,326 --> 00:11:22,990
Has it spread beyond the arm?
- No, not yet.

187
00:11:23,065 --> 00:11:24,123
Good.

188
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,489
I know.

189
00:11:29,404 --> 00:11:32,568
Did something happen to you over there
that you want to talk about?

190
00:11:32,642 --> 00:11:35,110
No, no, that was just some
kind of weird déjà vu.

191
00:11:35,178 --> 00:11:36,543
I'm over it now.

192
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,577
Hey, you want to go to Mr. Brody's
for a bite?

193
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:40,741
Now?

194
00:11:40,817 --> 00:11:43,981
- Matthew Scott!
- Hey, Mr. Volker!

195
00:11:44,054 --> 00:11:46,852
Dale, please.
I'm your pharmacist, for God's sakes.

196
00:11:47,357 --> 00:11:49,587
So you're back home.
No one... No one tells me these things.

197
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,595
Well, we're getting married this weekend.

198
00:11:51,663 --> 00:11:54,757
Right! Yes, I... I did hear
something about that.

199
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:57,762
Wow! That must be...

200
00:12:00,205 --> 00:12:01,935
- It is.
- Yeah, I bet it is.

201
00:12:02,007 --> 00:12:04,999
I bet it is. Good... Good, so, uh...

202
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:08,203
What are you up to?

203
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,911
Uh, on our way to Brody's, but, uh,
I don't think they're open yet, do you?

204
00:12:12,986 --> 00:12:16,251
Uh, why don't we find out?
No, it's no problem. No problem.

205
00:12:20,495 --> 00:12:24,431
Adam! Hey, guess who I just bumped into?
Matthew Scott and...

206
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:26,725
That's right.

207
00:12:26,801 --> 00:12:29,497
Yeah, hey, listen,
they were wondering if you were...

208
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:32,503
Just opened. Perfect.
Well, we'll see you in a few minutes.

209
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:35,736
They will... Them.
They... They'll see you. Good.

210
00:12:36,745 --> 00:12:39,738
Well, they're all there.
The staff's all there.

211
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,118
The, uh, waiters and...

212
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,109
So...

213
00:12:47,023 --> 00:12:48,513
Well, you're good to go.

214
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:05,971
Slow night, huh?

215
00:13:06,044 --> 00:13:08,342
Oh, no, place is packed. Everyone's hiding.

216
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:09,403
What?

217
00:13:09,482 --> 00:13:11,473
Surprise! Surprise!

218
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,850
You are a lot of work. Oh!

219
00:13:21,295 --> 00:13:24,753
Oh, you couldn't sit through
one damn movie, huh?

220
00:13:24,832 --> 00:13:27,699
I almost blew it, didn't I?
Mr. Volker was stalling.

221
00:13:27,768 --> 00:13:28,963
Oh, I'm such an idiot!

222
00:13:29,037 --> 00:13:31,699
Yes, you are, but my work is done.

223
00:13:31,773 --> 00:13:34,742
I have delivered you to your bachelor party.
Better early than never.

224
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,368
Well done.

225
00:13:37,345 --> 00:13:40,042
If he is hung-over in the morning...
No, no, no, we're good.

226
00:13:40,115 --> 00:13:42,481
We got it. Everything's...
Nothing to worry about.

227
00:13:42,551 --> 00:13:45,145
Listen, if you're not hung-over,
I will be very disappointed.

228
00:13:45,221 --> 00:13:50,023
Here's a toast to my son,
to my boy, who is getting hitched!

229
00:14:00,571 --> 00:14:03,734
What's that supposed to do?
Hopefully dull the pain.

230
00:14:05,142 --> 00:14:07,133
It's still spreading towards us.

231
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:11,046
Probably following the vibrations
of our movement. Anything?

232
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:14,415
- The venom had no effect.
- That's disappointing.

233
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:17,216
It didn't even react to the acid.
I tried everything you brought back.

234
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,780
It's like this thing is indestructible.

235
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,485
Well, you know what you have to do.

236
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:22,956
No. No...

237
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,894
- I know it looks extreme...
- No, he wouldn't want that.

238
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,661
Any rational person would give up
a limb if it meant saving their life.

239
00:14:27,735 --> 00:14:31,330
Hey, if we wait too long,
and it spreads to the rest of his body?

240
00:14:33,507 --> 00:14:35,304
Those things are still comin' this way.

241
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:37,242
The leading edge is on the other side
of those trees.

242
00:14:37,312 --> 00:14:39,280
Okay, that gives us roughly 15 minutes.

243
00:14:39,347 --> 00:14:40,405
Ten.

244
00:14:40,782 --> 00:14:42,181
Is that enough time?

245
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,650
No. We're almost to the gate.
We'll do it there.

246
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,109
Hurry.

247
00:14:55,164 --> 00:14:56,153
<i>Whoo!</i>

248
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,931
<i>- Whoo, whoo!
- Hey.</i>

249
00:15:04,074 --> 00:15:08,102
<i>Brody! Brody, Brody, what...
What is this? What's with this music?</i>

250
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,975
<i>What's wrong with it?
- What's wrong with it?</i>

251
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:14,382
<i>- It sounds like an animal dying.
Best man chooses the music.</i>

252
00:15:14,452 --> 00:15:15,919
<i>- I am the best man.
Oh, really?</i>

253
00:15:15,987 --> 00:15:18,957
<i>Oh, is this the man here?
This is your fault?</i>

254
00:15:19,692 --> 00:15:23,492
<i>Sir, I've been called a good man,
a strong man...</i>

255
00:15:23,562 --> 00:15:25,052
<i>An angry man...
- Hey.</i>

256
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:30,194
<i>But I ain't never been called a
"best man" until now, huh?</i>

257
00:15:32,405 --> 00:15:35,067
<i>Now, groom. "Groom" what is that?</i>

258
00:15:35,141 --> 00:15:37,235
<i>Oh, God, that's me...</i>

259
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,775
<i>Last call, guys!</i>

260
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,613
<i>Oh, come on, Vaness.
Come on, night's young.</i>

261
00:15:44,685 --> 00:15:46,779
<i>Come on, that's
it, keep 'em comin'.</i>

262
00:15:46,855 --> 00:15:49,187
<i>Uh, I think you are cut off.</i>

263
00:15:49,257 --> 00:15:53,091
<i>That is not the first time you've
told me that, if you catch my drift.</i>

264
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,026
<i>Let's not forget who
dumped who, Matt...</i>

265
00:15:55,097 --> 00:15:57,692
<i>An awkward moment
with Matt's ex...</i>

266
00:15:57,767 --> 00:16:00,133
<i>Are you flirting with me
the night before your wedding?</i>

267
00:16:00,203 --> 00:16:03,036
<i>Hey, I still got a whole 19 hours
of freedom left.</i>

268
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:07,575
<i>Okay. Well, then, let's go.
Right now.</i>

269
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,747
<i>We'll drive somewhere,
and we'll never come back.</i>

270
00:16:13,484 --> 00:16:17,251
<i>Whoa... Okay, come on, Vanessa.
I was... I was just kidding.</i>

271
00:16:19,024 --> 00:16:21,492
<i>Yeah. That's what I thought.</i>

272
00:16:26,065 --> 00:16:27,191
<i>Erase that.</i>

273
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,235
Okay, all right.

274
00:16:33,973 --> 00:16:36,534
You honestly weren't planning
on driving, were you?

275
00:16:38,979 --> 00:16:39,968
Well, not now.

276
00:16:40,047 --> 00:16:42,379
For God's sakes, Everett,
tomorrow's an important day.

277
00:16:42,449 --> 00:16:44,714
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. No, it's true.
It's true. You got him?

278
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:46,048
Yeah, I got him.

279
00:16:48,189 --> 00:16:50,282
Oh! Are we being arrested?

280
00:16:52,093 --> 00:16:55,029
Just a friendly ride home.
Call it a wedding present.

281
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:04,501
- So how was it over there?
- Boring.

282
00:17:04,574 --> 00:17:08,135
- He just means we didn't see any action.
- So, what's wrong with that?

283
00:17:08,211 --> 00:17:11,305
What's wrong with that?
It's a waste of ability.

284
00:17:12,682 --> 00:17:15,811
You're that good, huh?

285
00:17:17,455 --> 00:17:19,286
Well, don't take this the wrong way,
Sergeant,

286
00:17:19,356 --> 00:17:21,790
but guys like you
usually get themselves killed.

287
00:17:22,293 --> 00:17:24,285
- Guys like me?
David, why?

288
00:17:24,362 --> 00:17:25,954
Why do you always got to start a fight?

289
00:17:26,031 --> 00:17:27,123
It's a conversation...

290
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,224
Hey, you guys ever wonder what's real?

291
00:17:29,301 --> 00:17:31,895
Because ever since I got home,

292
00:17:32,437 --> 00:17:35,464
I keep thinking I'm someone else.

293
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,168
Like, I'm... I'm not myself.

294
00:17:37,243 --> 00:17:39,905
Alcohol can have that effect...
- No, I don't really drink.

295
00:17:39,979 --> 00:17:41,537
I can see that.

296
00:17:42,081 --> 00:17:44,880
- Oh, Chloe's gonna kill me.
- She'll... She'll get over it.

297
00:17:44,952 --> 00:17:47,921
- Go to sleep, all right?
- Yeah, go ahead, close your eyes.

298
00:17:49,756 --> 00:17:52,658
But I'm sorry to tell you that
when you wake up,

299
00:17:54,496 --> 00:17:57,260
you're gonna feel guilty for things
you've done or said.

300
00:17:57,932 --> 00:18:01,698
Some of it you won't even remember.
It'll just be a blur,

301
00:18:02,838 --> 00:18:04,806
and you're going to wonder
if you're ever going to feel

302
00:18:04,874 --> 00:18:06,967
like the person you used to be again.

303
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,209
Matthew?

304
00:18:15,285 --> 00:18:16,582
I think he's out.

305
00:18:16,653 --> 00:18:19,986
I hope so. I don't want him
waking up in the middle of this.

306
00:18:20,056 --> 00:18:21,751
I need you to hold him still.

307
00:18:21,825 --> 00:18:24,021
- Oh, God, I can't watch.
You don't have to.

308
00:18:24,095 --> 00:18:28,054
Take his feet. Hold tight.

309
00:18:28,966 --> 00:18:29,990
Hold his arm?

310
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,203
Have you done this before?

311
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:36,701
No.

312
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,386
Ready?

313
00:18:57,565 --> 00:18:58,554
Wait, wait. Stop, stop.

314
00:18:58,632 --> 00:18:59,656
What?

315
00:19:00,668 --> 00:19:03,160
Look at the color.

316
00:19:04,072 --> 00:19:07,906
- It's in his bloodstream.
- No point in dismembering him.

317
00:19:08,343 --> 00:19:11,745
- Not if it's spreading internally.
Damn it!

318
00:19:13,883 --> 00:19:15,407
So, what do we do now?

319
00:19:15,484 --> 00:19:17,850
We've got three hours
before the ship goes into...

320
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,854
- No, Sergeant, there's no...
- Let's keep at it.

321
00:19:19,922 --> 00:19:22,915
- We can still win this!
- This is an enemy you can't fight.

322
00:19:24,027 --> 00:19:27,588
Watch me. Three hours. That's the clock...

323
00:19:27,664 --> 00:19:28,858
Not really.

324
00:19:28,932 --> 00:19:31,925
He means we're gonna be overrun by the
organism in less than an hour, Greer.

325
00:19:32,003 --> 00:19:33,368
Are there any planets in range?

326
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:37,499
One, but it's locked out. I guess
it's more dangerous than this place.

327
00:19:37,575 --> 00:19:39,509
<i>- Dial the ship.
- We can't take him back to Destiny.</i>

328
00:19:39,577 --> 00:19:43,480
- We've already been through this...
- I know that! I need some things.

329
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:48,375
Matt?

330
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,590
Why did you drink so much?

331
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:57,994
Isn't that what
you're supposed to do at a bachelor party?

332
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:02,267
That's why you do things,
because you're supposed to?

333
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,401
Sometimes.

334
00:20:06,107 --> 00:20:08,075
Is that why you're getting married?

335
00:20:11,246 --> 00:20:14,545
What? No! Why would you say that?

336
00:20:18,887 --> 00:20:24,053
So you're not just coming back from war
to marry your high school sweetheart

337
00:20:24,127 --> 00:20:25,253
because you're supposed to?

338
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:28,463
Because you think it's
the right thing to do?

339
00:20:31,268 --> 00:20:32,462
Uh...

340
00:20:34,805 --> 00:20:38,673
Wow. You really should know the answer
faster than that, Matt...

341
00:20:38,743 --> 00:20:40,370
Chloe, this isn't fair.
My brain isn't working.

342
00:20:40,445 --> 00:20:43,471
Well, it had better start working.
This is your wedding day.

343
00:20:43,815 --> 00:20:47,080
You have to talk to the Justice of
the Peace at 10:00 about our vows.

344
00:20:47,152 --> 00:20:48,141
I know.

345
00:20:48,219 --> 00:20:49,585
You have to pick up your tuxedos.

346
00:20:49,655 --> 00:20:51,054
I know. Chloe...

347
00:20:53,225 --> 00:20:55,352
I really, really have to pee.

348
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,124
Oh!

349
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:15,741
So we're ruling out quarantine?

350
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:17,911
Well, it's not up to me
to rule out anything,

351
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:21,319
but we have to consider the possibility
that Lieutenant Scott's infection

352
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,290
is how this organism reproduces.

353
00:21:23,892 --> 00:21:25,359
It's already spread to his blood.

354
00:21:25,427 --> 00:21:28,556
- Well, still, there must be precautions.
- Against what?

355
00:21:28,631 --> 00:21:31,225
We have no idea what the next stage
of infection entails.

356
00:21:31,301 --> 00:21:34,737
Even if we were to manage to move him
from the Gate Room into quarantine,

357
00:21:34,804 --> 00:21:38,297
it's just a matter of time
before the infected area would burst open

358
00:21:38,376 --> 00:21:41,174
and release microscopic spores
into the ship's air.

359
00:21:41,245 --> 00:21:43,213
All we would have to do is breathe it in

360
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,941
and the same thing that's happening
to Scott

361
00:21:45,015 --> 00:21:46,983
could happen to all of us
from the inside out.

362
00:21:47,051 --> 00:21:48,713
Yeah, but you can't say that for sure.

363
00:21:48,787 --> 00:21:52,746
But we have to assume that this thing
has infected Scott in order to spread.

364
00:21:53,358 --> 00:21:57,989
One way or another.
It's what virulent, aggressive organisms do.

365
00:21:58,064 --> 00:22:02,000
- We can't invite it aboard.
- Okay.

366
00:22:02,068 --> 00:22:06,505
Look, um...
Please don't put this all on me.

367
00:22:06,572 --> 00:22:07,597
I'm not.

368
00:22:07,674 --> 00:22:10,040
Because he's one of the nicest people
on the ship,

369
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,975
and I just would hate
to be the one that's...

370
00:22:12,045 --> 00:22:13,535
Lisa, it's my decision.

371
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,743
As deep a ditch as you can dig.
Then the barricade.

372
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:22,016
Doesn't have to be pretty, just quick!

373
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,523
Anything outside of that...

374
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:26,149
is the kill zone.

375
00:22:26,228 --> 00:22:29,664
We gotta hold the gate for three hours.

376
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:34,392
Sergeant, we're sending a Kino, see
if we can get you some intel on this thing.

377
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:46,477
<i>Hello.</i>

378
00:22:46,551 --> 00:22:49,042
Hi. I'm Matt Scott.
You're marrying me tonight?

379
00:22:49,487 --> 00:22:51,421
I... I mean, me and my girlfriend.

380
00:22:51,489 --> 00:22:53,821
<i>I wasn't confused. Come in.</i>

381
00:22:55,994 --> 00:23:00,090
So, uh, I guess we just want to go
with the usual.

382
00:23:03,101 --> 00:23:04,432
The usual?

383
00:23:05,037 --> 00:23:08,496
Wedding vows.
You know, "Dearly beloved..."

384
00:23:08,575 --> 00:23:10,304
I know what wedding vows are.

385
00:23:14,013 --> 00:23:17,313
I'm sorry, I'm... I'm not all here today.

386
00:23:18,352 --> 00:23:19,512
So...

387
00:23:22,056 --> 00:23:24,456
To what do we owe this, uh,
partial presence?

388
00:23:26,962 --> 00:23:28,589
Are you having doubts
about what you're entering into?

389
00:23:29,731 --> 00:23:32,859
What, you...
You mean about marrying Chloe?

390
00:23:33,935 --> 00:23:37,565
No, no, I love her.
I'm just a little hung-over.

391
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,668
Like father, like son.

392
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,507
My dad is a great man.

393
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:51,219
Anyway, we talked about it, me and Chloe,
and we decided to go with the regular vows.

394
00:23:51,288 --> 00:23:52,619
They're all good.

395
00:23:54,325 --> 00:23:55,815
Traditional vows it is.

396
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:05,497
Um... Is there anything else
we need to talk about?

397
00:24:07,306 --> 00:24:08,671
I don't know. Is there?

398
00:24:11,777 --> 00:24:13,472
I've been having this feeling.

399
00:24:15,382 --> 00:24:17,043
I don't know how to describe it.

400
00:24:17,117 --> 00:24:18,641
Something's not quite right.

401
00:24:18,718 --> 00:24:21,983
Yes, yeah. Something is definitely
wrong here, and I...

402
00:24:23,558 --> 00:24:27,551
To tell you the truth,
I think I'm... I think I'm losing it.

403
00:24:30,731 --> 00:24:32,028
Have you spoken to your father?

404
00:24:32,099 --> 00:24:34,227
Every time I try to say something,
he tells me everything's great,

405
00:24:34,303 --> 00:24:35,736
- and I should just be happy.
- Ah...

406
00:24:35,804 --> 00:24:38,864
- The sage advice of great men.
- But I can see it in his eyes.

407
00:24:44,681 --> 00:24:46,546
Oh, I am scared.

408
00:24:49,218 --> 00:24:52,210
Well, you know,
I'm not a great man, Matthew,

409
00:24:53,791 --> 00:24:55,816
but I can tell you that fear...

410
00:24:56,527 --> 00:24:58,825
Well, it's just one of those things
in this world,

411
00:24:59,263 --> 00:25:02,665
that proves beyond a shadow of a doubt
that you're truly alive.

412
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:07,899
And I can tell you that you're alive

413
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:09,967
until you're dead.

414
00:25:12,912 --> 00:25:14,641
You are going to die, Matthew.

415
00:25:17,917 --> 00:25:20,886
We all will, eventually.

416
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:24,780
Well, yeah.

417
00:25:27,894 --> 00:25:30,795
So, 7:00, then?

418
00:25:33,735 --> 00:25:36,932
- The "Dearly Beloved" business.
- I'll be there.

419
00:25:38,406 --> 00:25:39,839
Your whole self, please.

420
00:25:51,788 --> 00:25:55,849
What we can see above ground must only
be a fraction of the whole organism.

421
00:25:55,925 --> 00:25:58,553
The bulk of it has to be
like an enormous root system

422
00:25:58,628 --> 00:26:00,562
that extends outward from the flora,

423
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:03,623
dormant until its prey gets close enough
to get stung

424
00:26:03,701 --> 00:26:05,828
and survive just long enough
to spread spores.

425
00:26:06,904 --> 00:26:08,895
I don't even want to think
of what it could do aboard ship.

426
00:26:08,973 --> 00:26:11,738
What do you think it is, plant, animal?

427
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:15,746
Maybe properties of both, like coral,
except its growth rate

428
00:26:15,814 --> 00:26:18,248
smacks right up against the laws
of thermodynamics.

429
00:26:18,316 --> 00:26:19,783
It spreads upon contact,

430
00:26:19,851 --> 00:26:23,015
and it resisted every chemical
T.J.'s exposed to it.

431
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:26,117
Hmm. Let's hope it burns.

432
00:26:35,836 --> 00:26:39,363
Short bursts, gentlemen. Short bursts.

433
00:26:53,522 --> 00:26:54,989
T.J., go to Two.

434
00:27:01,531 --> 00:27:02,520
Yes, sir.

435
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,098
Are you sure Lieutenant Scott
is the only one who's been infected?

436
00:27:06,636 --> 00:27:09,196
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
- Well, I need you to be damn sure.

437
00:27:09,272 --> 00:27:11,969
I'm going to need you to send
non-combatants back to the ship.

438
00:27:12,043 --> 00:27:14,443
<i>The last thing we need is a mad dash
at the last minute.</i>

439
00:27:14,512 --> 00:27:15,809
Understood, sir.

440
00:27:16,114 --> 00:27:17,342
T.J., that means you, too.

441
00:27:17,415 --> 00:27:19,212
Sir, I'd like to keep trying.

442
00:27:19,283 --> 00:27:21,115
<i>Don't make me come down there
and get you.</i>

443
00:27:21,186 --> 00:27:23,677
I'm not willing to lose both of you.
Young out.

444
00:27:34,367 --> 00:27:35,561
He's dying, isn't he?

445
00:27:37,904 --> 00:27:39,065
How long?

446
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:41,800
I don't know.

447
00:27:42,443 --> 00:27:44,911
He's strong,
so probably longer than we can stay.

448
00:27:44,979 --> 00:27:46,503
No, I'm not leaving him.

449
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,277
Chloe, I just got orders to send everybody
but Greer's team back to the ship,

450
00:27:49,351 --> 00:27:50,443
and that includes you.

451
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:52,384
- Tamara, I have a right to stay.
- No, you don't!

452
00:27:52,454 --> 00:27:53,785
I'm not leaving!

453
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:56,748
Chloe...

454
00:27:58,393 --> 00:28:01,090
Oh, my God.

455
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:15,908
- It doesn't look like it touched your skin.
- How did it get there?

456
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,481
Maybe when Matt first cut the thing.

457
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:21,383
It could have been a microscopic droplet
for all we know.

458
00:28:21,452 --> 00:28:25,013
It grew right through the material.
It's a miracle you weren't infected.

459
00:28:27,425 --> 00:28:28,450
Greer!

460
00:28:29,795 --> 00:28:30,853
Over here.

461
00:28:43,577 --> 00:28:45,272
You've got to be kidding me.

462
00:28:53,454 --> 00:28:54,512
Okay, listen up!

463
00:28:54,589 --> 00:28:58,356
Everyone not on Sergeant Greer's fire team
is going back through the stargate.

464
00:28:58,427 --> 00:29:01,123
Each of you needs to be checked
for traces of the organism

465
00:29:01,196 --> 00:29:05,633
on your person before you go! Eyes only.
Use the buddy system, okay?

466
00:29:25,256 --> 00:29:26,484
Eli, that means you.

467
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:31,152
I've been checking myself every 30 seconds.
Just... Just give me a minute, okay?

468
00:29:44,243 --> 00:29:45,972
Damn, we look good.

469
00:29:47,047 --> 00:29:49,106
Is that you or Kiefer talking?

470
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,841
Oh, I think Mr. Sutherland would agree.

471
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,079
All right, they fit?

472
00:29:53,153 --> 00:29:56,920
It's like the enthusiasm
just explodes out of your face.

473
00:29:56,991 --> 00:29:59,357
Yeah, well, you did this to me. Go change.

474
00:30:04,165 --> 00:30:07,966
Listen, Matt. I can't help but notice
that something's bothering you.

475
00:30:08,637 --> 00:30:10,798
- Beyond the blood alcohol level.
- I'm fine.

476
00:30:14,143 --> 00:30:15,475
I... I'm just saying that we've...

477
00:30:16,046 --> 00:30:17,604
We've known each other a long time,

478
00:30:17,681 --> 00:30:19,876
and I can pretty much tell
when something is...

479
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,542
What, you think you know me?

480
00:30:23,053 --> 00:30:24,611
You're not that deep.

481
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:35,362
Look, nobody who knows you at all
thinks of you as a one-girl guy.

482
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,967
It's not a criticism, okay?
It's just... It's who you are.

483
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:44,900
If you're having cold feet, I think that...

484
00:30:44,978 --> 00:30:48,709
No, listen, listen, I'm going to marry Chloe,
and we're going to have a half-dozen kids,

485
00:30:49,315 --> 00:30:51,875
buy a house on my dad's street.
We're going to renovate it together,

486
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:54,887
play catch with the kids in the front yard,
and go to Brody's every Friday night.

487
00:30:54,955 --> 00:30:57,150
You can videotape the whole dang thing.

488
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:02,829
Well..."A," that's a lot of tape.

489
00:31:05,734 --> 00:31:09,500
And "B," I don't think
you believe that yourself.

490
00:31:13,074 --> 00:31:14,133
Are we done?

491
00:31:24,521 --> 00:31:26,148
Lf... If you can hear me,

492
00:31:26,223 --> 00:31:29,954
I just want you to know
that nobody's giving up on you.

493
00:31:31,228 --> 00:31:32,695
Sweep! Sweep!

494
00:31:40,772 --> 00:31:42,672
I mean, you should see Greer's face.

495
00:31:43,374 --> 00:31:45,104
He's taking no prisoners.

496
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,675
You'd better keep fighting, too.

497
00:31:50,849 --> 00:31:52,146
Eli!
- Okay?

498
00:31:53,853 --> 00:31:55,980
- Eli...
- I asked for one lousy minute.

499
00:31:56,056 --> 00:31:57,182
Where's Chloe?

500
00:31:59,325 --> 00:32:01,589
- Chloe!
- Chloe!

501
00:32:03,397 --> 00:32:04,455
Chloe!

502
00:32:10,504 --> 00:32:11,766
What happened?

503
00:32:15,877 --> 00:32:18,903
Now I have to stay.
- No, you didn't, did you?

504
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,607
It wasn't that hard.

505
00:32:20,682 --> 00:32:23,777
- It doesn't even hurt that much.
- Chloe, why would you do that?

506
00:32:24,754 --> 00:32:26,915
They weren't going to let me stay.

507
00:32:28,591 --> 00:32:29,819
Now they have no choice.

508
00:32:29,892 --> 00:32:32,623
- But now you can't come back!
- She's already made up her mind.

509
00:32:33,097 --> 00:32:37,261
Look, I'm sorry, Eli, but I had to do this.

510
00:32:40,337 --> 00:32:42,101
Go have someone check you out.

511
00:33:13,207 --> 00:33:17,075
Hi. I'm Tamara, I'm a paramedic.
Your friends called 911.

512
00:33:18,946 --> 00:33:21,381
- Why?
- You were on the floor, man.

513
00:33:21,517 --> 00:33:22,506
Why?

514
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:25,052
A lot of things can cause a syncope
episode, but you don't have a fever.

515
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,485
He was hit by a car yesterday.

516
00:33:26,555 --> 00:33:28,716
No, don't listen to him.
That was nothing.

517
00:33:29,324 --> 00:33:31,520
I just had a little too much
to drink last night.

518
00:33:31,594 --> 00:33:34,757
- You could be low on electrolytes.
- Awesome, let's go with that.

519
00:33:34,831 --> 00:33:37,061
Okay, well, just to be safe,
I'm going to take him to the hospital...

520
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:39,226
No, no, no, I'm getting married tonight,

521
00:33:39,302 --> 00:33:41,999
and I'm gonna be there
if they have to prop me up with a stick.

522
00:33:43,073 --> 00:33:44,199
Lucky girl.

523
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:46,938
- I just mean I'll be fine.
- Up to you.

524
00:33:47,011 --> 00:33:49,536
Just do me a favor and have some
chicken soup or something, okay?

525
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:50,911
- Mmm-hmm.
- Okay.

526
00:33:59,991 --> 00:34:00,981
Whoa.

527
00:34:01,394 --> 00:34:05,262
They don't like that. Come on!
How about this, huh?

528
00:34:05,765 --> 00:34:08,757
You want some of this, huh?
How about some of this!

529
00:34:31,493 --> 00:34:32,585
Bye.

530
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,296
Chloe...

531
00:34:43,306 --> 00:34:46,935
Before I go, please tell me you didn't
do this to keep a dying boy company.

532
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,273
The organism got on my clothes.

533
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:54,884
I know it touched my skin, it had to.

534
00:34:55,286 --> 00:34:57,083
I should have been infected, but I wasn't.

535
00:34:57,154 --> 00:34:58,849
So you decided to test if you were immune.

536
00:35:00,759 --> 00:35:02,226
- And?
- It doesn't hurt.

537
00:35:02,995 --> 00:35:04,485
Matt was in agony by now.

538
00:35:06,832 --> 00:35:08,390
Lieutenant Johansen...

539
00:35:13,106 --> 00:35:14,971
- David.
- Hey.

540
00:35:15,842 --> 00:35:17,935
- Thank you for coming.
- Wouldn't have missed it.

541
00:35:18,011 --> 00:35:19,445
- How's your boy doing?
- Oh, he's fantastic.

542
00:35:19,513 --> 00:35:22,107
You know, white as the plastic man
on the cake, but that's just nerves.

543
00:35:22,182 --> 00:35:23,774
<i>- Congratulations.
- Thank you.</i>

544
00:35:24,285 --> 00:35:27,812
<i>It's true, I nearly killed him yesterday.
Ran right over him.</i>

545
00:35:31,092 --> 00:35:35,620
<i>Oh, come on, I told you to keep
that thing out of my face.</i>

546
00:35:37,299 --> 00:35:38,426
<i>Before the ceremony,</i>

547
00:35:38,501 --> 00:35:42,904
<i>Matt enjoys a hot bowl of soup and
the camaraderie of his closest friends.</i>

548
00:35:42,972 --> 00:35:44,371
Has my dad showed up yet?

549
00:35:44,974 --> 00:35:46,339
- He's mingling.
- Good.

550
00:35:46,409 --> 00:35:48,537
Just make sure you get a shot
of Chloe comin' in.

551
00:35:48,612 --> 00:35:49,601
Right.

552
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,478
Hey...

553
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:01,617
We can do this another day.

554
00:36:02,794 --> 00:36:05,922
There he is. How's my boy? You ready?

555
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:08,961
No.

556
00:36:09,034 --> 00:36:10,626
What... What do you mean, no?

557
00:36:10,703 --> 00:36:13,263
I mean, I don't know if I can do this.

558
00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:16,670
What if it doesn't work out?
What if it's wrong? What...

559
00:36:18,044 --> 00:36:20,877
- What if I hurt her?
- Well, you would never do that.

560
00:36:21,081 --> 00:36:24,380
- Oh, we're so different from each other.
- Can you give us a second?

561
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:30,650
Hey.

562
00:36:32,927 --> 00:36:34,258
What do you want from me?

563
00:36:35,796 --> 00:36:37,355
Just tell me the right thing to do.

564
00:36:38,066 --> 00:36:39,533
What, you think I know?

565
00:36:40,302 --> 00:36:44,238
- I'm asking you, please, Dad.
- Wake up.

566
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,768
Wake up.

567
00:37:09,601 --> 00:37:11,091
Your blood looks normal to me.

568
00:37:11,169 --> 00:37:13,103
No, but it's not normal. They changed me.

569
00:37:13,171 --> 00:37:14,934
You said the chair undid all that.

570
00:37:15,006 --> 00:37:17,202
Well, obviously she relapsed.

571
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:21,337
The point is whatever they did to her,
it's given her immunity to this organism.

572
00:37:21,414 --> 00:37:23,575
Look. Look, I'm already healing.

573
00:37:23,883 --> 00:37:26,512
A transfusion of Chloe's blood
could help save his life.

574
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,986
And pass whatever the Aliens
did to her on to him.

575
00:37:29,055 --> 00:37:31,455
Well, I think that's a bargain
he'd be willing to make, don't you?

576
00:37:38,065 --> 00:37:39,225
Dearly beloved,

577
00:37:40,134 --> 00:37:44,798
<i>we are gathered here in the face of
this company to join this man</i>

578
00:37:44,872 --> 00:37:46,841
<i>and this woman in matrimony.</i>

579
00:37:48,544 --> 00:37:52,446
It is not to be entered into unadvisedly
or lightly,

580
00:37:53,215 --> 00:37:58,347
but reverently, discreetly, advisedly,
and solemnly.

581
00:37:59,989 --> 00:38:04,016
Marriage is the union of husband
and wife in heart, body, and mind.

582
00:38:04,862 --> 00:38:07,194
<i>It is intended for their mutual joy,</i>

583
00:38:07,698 --> 00:38:12,795
and for the help and comfort given one
another in prosperity and adversity.

584
00:38:17,843 --> 00:38:21,279
<i>Through this union,
Matthew and Chloe make a commitment</i>

585
00:38:21,346 --> 00:38:24,646
<i>to embrace their dreams,
realize their hopes,</i>

586
00:38:25,017 --> 00:38:27,850
<i>and to accept each other's failings.</i>

587
00:38:32,024 --> 00:38:34,289
We are here today to witness this occasion,

588
00:38:34,628 --> 00:38:37,222
that marks the celebration
of love and commitment

589
00:38:37,297 --> 00:38:40,733
with which this man and this woman
begin their life together.

590
00:38:41,368 --> 00:38:46,170
If any person can show just cause
why they may not be joined together,

591
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:50,602
<i>then let them speak now
or forever hold their peace.</i>

592
00:38:58,254 --> 00:39:00,654
Damn things don't want to burn.
I'm running out of fuel.

593
00:39:00,723 --> 00:39:02,748
His pulse is getting stronger.
I just need a little more time.

594
00:39:02,825 --> 00:39:04,589
I can't give it to you!

595
00:39:11,768 --> 00:39:14,067
Please! I know it's working!

596
00:39:14,138 --> 00:39:17,437
Sergeant, last time we dialed the gate,
did you see how it reacted?

597
00:39:18,376 --> 00:39:20,310
We just got to keep dialing over and over.

598
00:39:20,378 --> 00:39:24,076
- It may buy us the time we need.
- Not we. Just me.

599
00:39:25,417 --> 00:39:29,046
This ramp is about to get crowded.
I need you two to get out of here.

600
00:39:29,121 --> 00:39:33,183
- Sergeant...
- Go, go! Get out! Go!

601
00:39:51,612 --> 00:39:55,344
Do you, Matthew, take Chloe
to be your wife?

602
00:40:17,507 --> 00:40:19,338
<i>Will you love her, comfort her,</i>

603
00:40:19,409 --> 00:40:22,311
honor and keep her in sickness
and in health,

604
00:40:26,284 --> 00:40:30,550
for richer, for poorer,
for better, for worse,

605
00:40:35,761 --> 00:40:39,253
in sadness and in joy
and forsaking all others,

606
00:40:39,665 --> 00:40:44,729
keep yourself only unto her
for as long as you both shall live?

607
00:40:50,043 --> 00:40:51,204
He's conscious.

608
00:40:52,847 --> 00:40:54,781
- What the hell's going on?
- Stay down!

609
00:40:55,049 --> 00:40:57,244
Oh, my God, his arm!

610
00:40:57,818 --> 00:41:00,184
Are you okay?
- Well, yeah, but...

611
00:41:02,124 --> 00:41:03,557
Come on.

612
00:41:07,362 --> 00:41:08,454
Let's go!

613
00:41:13,336 --> 00:41:15,395
Whoa! We're okay, we're okay.

614
00:41:19,542 --> 00:41:20,908
Welcome home, son.

615
00:41:21,578 --> 00:41:25,309
Thank you, sir.
I, uh, I don't know how they did it, but...

616
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:27,074
Unfortunately, I do know.

617
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:31,581
The three of you will undergo
decontamination right away.

618
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,014
Yes, sir.

619
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:34,922
As for the two of you,

620
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:40,057
you'll be placed in quarantine indefinitely,
until I decide what to do with you.

621
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,958
Sir?

622
00:41:44,637 --> 00:41:46,434
I'll let Miss Armstrong explain.

623
00:43:29,553 --> 00:43:30,542
