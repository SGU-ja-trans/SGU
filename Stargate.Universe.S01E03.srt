1
00:00:26,442 --> 00:00:27,739
Hot.

2
00:00:30,813 --> 00:00:32,212
Cool.

3
00:00:42,992 --> 00:00:44,584
SCOTT: Make sure
we can dial back to the ship.

4
00:00:44,693 --> 00:00:45,819
FRANKLIN: Already on it.

5
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,724
- PALMER: Looks like gypsum.
- That would be good.

6
00:00:55,271 --> 00:00:56,499
Why?

7
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:59,631
- We're looking for calcium carbonate.
- RUSH: Calcite.

8
00:00:59,775 --> 00:01:03,905
Gypsum is calcium sulfate,
which is 36% calcium carbonate.

9
00:01:04,013 --> 00:01:05,071
ELI: Hmm.

10
00:01:11,903 --> 00:01:13,666
Huh. It dissolves.

11
00:01:13,772 --> 00:01:15,865
Are you saying we can use this sand
to fix the scrubbers?

12
00:01:16,007 --> 00:01:17,497
- That would be convenient.
- PALMER: No.

13
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:20,373
RUSH: Well, it's a fair indication
that the components may exist nearby.

14
00:01:20,512 --> 00:01:22,036
PALMER: For the sake
of portability and efficiency,

15
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,809
I'm hoping to find
high-concentration granular limestone.

16
00:01:25,917 --> 00:01:30,251
We are looking for the dried lake bed
or salt-water body all this sand came from.

17
00:01:31,456 --> 00:01:32,548
It's a desert.

18
00:01:33,591 --> 00:01:36,526
Lime is formed mostly from
the remains of marine organisms.

19
00:01:36,628 --> 00:01:38,493
- Huh.
- Are you saying there was life here?

20
00:01:38,596 --> 00:01:40,655
RUSH: Not likely
anything we've seen before.

21
00:01:46,972 --> 00:01:48,564
Yeah, the water may be gone now,

22
00:01:48,707 --> 00:01:52,541
but this desert was formed by
H20 evaporating on a playa floor,

23
00:01:52,644 --> 00:01:56,045
causing gypsum to be deposited
in a fine crystalline form called selenite.

24
00:01:56,147 --> 00:01:59,514
- Where are you going?
- Higher ground.

25
00:02:05,557 --> 00:02:06,615
Is that supposed to happen?

26
00:02:07,892 --> 00:02:10,793
PALMER: If this sand is high enough
in calcite concentration,

27
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:13,056
the solution would absorb the acid.

28
00:02:13,164 --> 00:02:15,598
- Right.
- The liquid would turn clear.

29
00:02:16,668 --> 00:02:17,726
It's not.

30
00:02:21,773 --> 00:02:22,797
We're good!

31
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,807
This is Scott.

32
00:02:26,945 --> 00:02:30,745
Unfortunately, there's nothing useful
in the immediate vicinity of the gate.

33
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:33,750
YOUNG: You have 12 hours, Lieutenant.
Make them count.

34
00:02:34,452 --> 00:02:35,714
Copy that.

35
00:02:37,422 --> 00:02:39,413
We're moving out!

36
00:02:44,362 --> 00:02:46,296
Too bad we can't just use this sand.

37
00:02:47,866 --> 00:02:50,266
There certainly is enough of it.

38
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,620
I'm fine.

39
00:03:16,728 --> 00:03:20,494
No, you're not,
and neither am I, but we're...

40
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:22,699
We're still alive because of what he did.

41
00:03:22,801 --> 00:03:25,964
- Look, for what it's worth...
- Well, it's worth a lot.

42
00:03:26,071 --> 00:03:28,437
You know, as long as we're still here,
I promise you...

43
00:03:28,573 --> 00:03:32,009
Colonel, I've edited enough
of my father's speeches

44
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,168
to know what you're going to say.

45
00:03:33,278 --> 00:03:36,338
You don't have a clue
what I was going to say, because I don't.

46
00:03:40,252 --> 00:03:41,446
We...

47
00:03:42,587 --> 00:03:46,546
We brought along an Ancient device.
Communication stones.

48
00:03:46,658 --> 00:03:48,888
- They allow us to...
- Yeah, I know what they are.

49
00:03:48,994 --> 00:03:53,090
Good. Well, I'm about to use one of them
to report to my superiors on Earth,

50
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:55,222
tell them our situation.

51
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,236
I want to tell her myself.

52
00:04:15,737 --> 00:04:18,262
You've been sitting here
since Rush made contact.

53
00:04:18,373 --> 00:04:19,772
Let somebody else take a shift.

54
00:04:21,476 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm not leaving this chair.

55
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:25,144
I've been on this project
for the last six months,

56
00:04:25,246 --> 00:04:26,941
and I'll be damned if...

57
00:04:29,717 --> 00:04:30,979
Colonel?

58
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,789
This is strange.

59
00:04:44,499 --> 00:04:46,364
MEHTA: Dr. Rush, is that you?

60
00:04:47,268 --> 00:04:48,462
No, it's Colonel Young.

61
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:51,231
I need you to put me in a room
with General O'Neill.

62
00:04:57,378 --> 00:04:58,902
I'm going to need you, too.

63
00:04:59,347 --> 00:05:01,076
JOHANSEN: Sir, I told you not to get up.

64
00:05:04,085 --> 00:05:05,177
TELFORD: What did he do to himself?

65
00:05:05,286 --> 00:05:07,516
He's got cracked ribs,
more bruises than I can count

66
00:05:07,622 --> 00:05:10,216
and a concussion
that resulted in neuropraxia.

67
00:05:10,358 --> 00:05:12,918
- Oh, that's just great.
- Chloe?

68
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:15,495
- Dr. Mehta.
- Can you help me, please?

69
00:05:20,735 --> 00:05:24,603
You know, I had some of my
favorite arguments with your father.

70
00:05:24,739 --> 00:05:27,173
Are you saying you won some?

71
00:05:28,109 --> 00:05:29,906
Depends on who you ask.

72
00:05:34,082 --> 00:05:37,245
Listen, Major Green'll be escorting you
to see your mother.

73
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:42,719
- Please give her my condolences.
- Thank you.

74
00:05:47,428 --> 00:05:48,588
Yeah.

75
00:05:51,232 --> 00:05:54,030
So, how is it going out there really?

76
00:05:54,135 --> 00:05:57,696
I don't know what Rush has told you.
We may not have much time left.

77
00:05:57,805 --> 00:05:59,739
The ship's very old. It's falling apart.

78
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:01,965
- Fix it.
- We're trying.

79
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:05,011
Even if we can get the life support working,
we don't have much food and water.

80
00:06:05,113 --> 00:06:07,775
- Then go get some.
- We're not supposed to be there, sir.

81
00:06:07,915 --> 00:06:09,974
These are the wrong people
in the wrong place,

82
00:06:10,118 --> 00:06:12,382
and as a group, they're just not qualified.

83
00:06:12,487 --> 00:06:13,613
Oh, please.

84
00:06:13,755 --> 00:06:16,246
I wasn't qualified to lead that first team
through the stargate...

85
00:06:16,391 --> 00:06:19,360
- I understand that, sir.
- In the past dozen years or so,

86
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,759
we've sent hundreds of teams
through that thing...

87
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,926
And I think the bottom line is,

88
00:06:29,237 --> 00:06:30,932
none of us are qualified.

89
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:33,466
I just think we're going to get
to a point very soon

90
00:06:33,608 --> 00:06:36,543
where everyone onboard
should get a chance to say goodbye.

91
00:06:38,946 --> 00:06:39,935
Understood.

92
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,154
Save it.

93
00:06:58,966 --> 00:07:00,593
FRANKLIN: That's not very smart.

94
00:07:00,701 --> 00:07:02,794
Temperatures like these,
the human body needs at least...

95
00:07:02,937 --> 00:07:05,269
GREER: Walk, don't talk.

96
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:10,172
Just FYI, he's right about
the whole human body and water...

97
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:12,643
- Eli!
- Walk, don't...

98
00:07:17,452 --> 00:07:20,979
Oh. Look. More sand.

99
00:07:23,191 --> 00:07:24,852
FRANKLIN: This is pointless.
We should go back.

100
00:07:24,992 --> 00:07:26,186
PALMER: We just got here.

101
00:07:26,627 --> 00:07:29,687
I still think we should be checking out
the other planets in range of the ship.

102
00:07:29,831 --> 00:07:33,665
RUSH: I still think you're wrong.
The solution's here.

103
00:08:01,696 --> 00:08:04,324
ELI: I know. It was a mirage,

104
00:08:04,432 --> 00:08:08,061
but when we were
walking over that last dune,

105
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:12,398
I thought I saw the Statue of Liberty
sticking half out of the sand.

106
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,303
Just for a second there.

107
00:08:14,408 --> 00:08:18,469
I was all ready to yell, "Damn you!

108
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,308
"Damn you all to hell!"

109
00:08:26,254 --> 00:08:28,688
Oh, come on. That was funny.

110
00:08:28,823 --> 00:08:30,051
Was it?

111
00:08:31,425 --> 00:08:33,791
Because it would mean
we were really on Earth,

112
00:08:33,895 --> 00:08:36,989
but in the future,
and the apes had taken over

113
00:08:37,098 --> 00:08:38,793
and then buried the Statue of Liberty
for some reason.

114
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,629
Eli? Have a drink.

115
00:08:40,735 --> 00:08:43,704
Greer, hold up! Hold up!

116
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,039
- This isn't going to work.
- GREER: Not if we keep stopping.

117
00:08:49,177 --> 00:08:51,475
I'm saying we need to split up.

118
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:52,841
Fine with me.

119
00:08:52,947 --> 00:08:54,642
I agree. Franklin, you should come with me.

120
00:08:54,749 --> 00:08:56,410
Nah. No, no, no, you're with me and Greer.

121
00:08:58,119 --> 00:09:02,146
Sun's been moving that way,
we'll call it west.

122
00:09:03,624 --> 00:09:08,493
Eli, Franklin, Palmer, and Curtis,
you head that way.

123
00:09:08,596 --> 00:09:10,086
We'll test every 20 minutes or so.

124
00:09:10,198 --> 00:09:12,098
After two hours, you head southeast.

125
00:09:12,233 --> 00:09:13,860
That should take you back
in the direction of the gate.

126
00:09:13,968 --> 00:09:15,936
Whoa, wait a second.

127
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:19,096
Do we really think
that splitting up is the best idea?

128
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,935
I say we head straight back.

129
00:09:21,242 --> 00:09:24,405
There's no point in crossing over
the same territory we've just crossed.

130
00:09:24,545 --> 00:09:27,241
Or we could just stick together.

131
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,219
Look, Matt, I'm sorry.

132
00:09:36,324 --> 00:09:41,694
I just have this really, really sick feeling

133
00:09:41,796 --> 00:09:45,698
that you're going to go that way,
and we're going to go this way.

134
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,201
Eli, I need someone that I can trust
to lead the second team, okay?

135
00:09:49,303 --> 00:09:50,793
That is you.

136
00:09:51,138 --> 00:09:53,106
Curtis is a good soldier. He's a tough guy.

137
00:09:53,241 --> 00:09:55,038
He's not going to let
anything happen to you.

138
00:09:55,142 --> 00:09:57,770
Truth is, I'm slowing you down
and you want to get rid of me.

139
00:09:57,912 --> 00:10:00,437
I'm doing what I think
will best accomplish this mission.

140
00:10:01,249 --> 00:10:02,910
You asked to come.

141
00:10:03,017 --> 00:10:05,815
I'm telling you how you can help me.
Now suck it up.

142
00:10:07,822 --> 00:10:09,221
Yeah. Okay.

143
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:16,093
Okay, guys, we're going this way.
Move out!

144
00:10:17,632 --> 00:10:19,896
SCOTT: Radio if you find the lake bed,
we'll double back.

145
00:10:20,001 --> 00:10:23,334
ELI: When you see the Statue of Liberty,
you know what to say, right?

146
00:10:23,471 --> 00:10:26,406
Right. Now we can make some time.

147
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,067
She's here? Right now?

148
00:10:53,102 --> 00:10:53,897
She's here? Right now?

149
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:56,469
- Yes, ma'am, but as I've explained...
- Chloe!

150
00:10:56,604 --> 00:10:58,231
Mrs. Armstrong...

151
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:13,384
I know I look different and I sound different,

152
00:11:14,488 --> 00:11:16,149
but it's me.

153
00:11:17,758 --> 00:11:21,717
Mom, please. I have something to tell you.

154
00:11:22,663 --> 00:11:25,063
Mom... Stop!

155
00:11:32,707 --> 00:11:34,470
I'm sorry. It's just...

156
00:11:39,246 --> 00:11:42,875
The thought that
you're actually on some ship

157
00:11:43,017 --> 00:11:45,042
so far away, I can't even imagine.

158
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,887
- Mom...
- Just tell me you're coming home.

159
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:52,685
I don't know.

160
00:11:54,628 --> 00:11:56,061
Mom, please!

161
00:12:03,137 --> 00:12:05,537
The ship is old and damaged.

162
00:12:06,807 --> 00:12:09,571
We were losing air and somebody had to...

163
00:12:12,113 --> 00:12:13,512
He's dead.

164
00:12:14,648 --> 00:12:15,740
He's dead, isn't he?

165
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:36,896
MEHTA: Where is everyone?

166
00:12:37,004 --> 00:12:38,301
Able bodies are searching the ship

167
00:12:38,439 --> 00:12:41,374
for anything that might have
CO2 sequestration properties,

168
00:12:41,475 --> 00:12:43,204
and the rest are in crew quarters.

169
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:53,878
Colonel, we were able
to dial out to the planet again.

170
00:12:53,988 --> 00:12:56,320
JOHANSEN: Colonel Young and Chloe
are using the communication stones.

171
00:12:56,457 --> 00:12:58,425
This is Colonel Telford, Dr. Mehta.

172
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,122
Uh... Right. Okay.

173
00:13:03,097 --> 00:13:05,224
Did you make radio contact
with the off-world team?

174
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:08,658
Yes, nothing to report yet. They've split up.

175
00:13:08,803 --> 00:13:10,964
How much time
before the ship jumps back to FTL?

176
00:13:11,105 --> 00:13:13,005
Roughly nine hours.

177
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,335
Dial out every 20 minutes.
Maintain regular contact.

178
00:13:15,476 --> 00:13:17,603
We do have power issues to be aware of.

179
00:13:17,711 --> 00:13:19,235
Dialing the gate is a significant drain

180
00:13:19,346 --> 00:13:21,439
on what seems to be
limited resources at this point.

181
00:13:21,549 --> 00:13:24,279
The away mission is priority one
right now.

182
00:13:24,952 --> 00:13:26,442
- Sir?
- I'm fine.

183
00:13:26,554 --> 00:13:28,852
I understand that there are
other stargates in range.

184
00:13:28,989 --> 00:13:30,854
Four other addresses
came up in the system,

185
00:13:30,991 --> 00:13:32,253
but we seem to be locked out from here.

186
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:33,587
Well, have you tried working around it?

187
00:13:33,694 --> 00:13:35,685
Dr. Rush didn't think that was a good idea.

188
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:38,355
I think it makes sense to know
what our options are, so do what you can.

189
00:13:38,499 --> 00:13:41,024
There has to be a good reason why
these addresses are being disqualified.

190
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:43,659
If I wasn't being clear,
I was giving you an order.

191
00:13:44,038 --> 00:13:47,098
If there are good reasons,
find out exactly what they are.

192
00:13:47,475 --> 00:13:49,943
- Let's keep moving, I want to see more.
- You should rest.

193
00:13:50,044 --> 00:13:51,136
Lieutenant.

194
00:13:51,245 --> 00:13:53,338
Sir, Colonel Young's body
needs time to recover.

195
00:13:53,481 --> 00:13:54,675
TELFORD: Give me something for the pain.

196
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,045
The body feels pain for a reason.
I would rather not mask it.

197
00:13:57,184 --> 00:14:00,847
Just do it, Lieutenant. From the sound
of things, you need my help here.

198
00:14:09,196 --> 00:14:11,130
All right, come on. Let's go.

199
00:14:13,234 --> 00:14:14,826
You better save some of that.

200
00:14:15,903 --> 00:14:19,202
- We need to slow down.
- We need to cover more ground.

201
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,865
RUSH: It's going to be impossible
to maintain this pace on the way back.

202
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:23,067
GREER: Maybe for you.

203
00:14:24,378 --> 00:14:27,643
How tedious. Little boys playing soldier.

204
00:14:27,748 --> 00:14:29,648
Well, I'm sorry.
I've no interest in playing your game.

205
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,842
I'm not playing anything,

206
00:14:30,951 --> 00:14:32,680
I'm trying to save the lives
of everyone aboard that ship.

207
00:14:32,786 --> 00:14:34,811
If we continue this pace,
we're going to die out here.

208
00:14:34,922 --> 00:14:36,753
Yeah, maybe we will.

209
00:14:38,225 --> 00:14:43,822
Light years away from the admiring eyes
of your father, or your drill sergeant,

210
00:14:43,931 --> 00:14:46,729
or whoever's approval it is
you so desperately seek.

211
00:14:48,235 --> 00:14:49,759
- How dare you!
- Get up and move.

212
00:14:49,904 --> 00:14:51,337
Hey, did you see that?

213
00:14:52,806 --> 00:14:54,034
What?

214
00:14:57,578 --> 00:14:59,546
I don't know. Nothing.

215
00:15:00,781 --> 00:15:02,180
Let's move.

216
00:15:04,985 --> 00:15:08,216
One hour.
One hour, and then we start circling back.

217
00:15:08,322 --> 00:15:10,051
All right, fine.

218
00:15:39,286 --> 00:15:41,413
- Just hold that there.
- Thank you.

219
00:15:48,596 --> 00:15:49,756
What did you...

220
00:15:53,534 --> 00:15:56,560
That was supposed to be for the pain.
What did you give to him?

221
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,264
A strong sedative,
which we are desperately short on

222
00:15:59,373 --> 00:16:01,341
and I should not have had to use
just so that Colonel Young

223
00:16:01,475 --> 00:16:04,103
can return to a body in working condition.

224
00:16:04,211 --> 00:16:06,304
You are out of line, Lieutenant.

225
00:16:06,447 --> 00:16:09,416
Disregarding the health
of another human being is out of line.

226
00:16:09,516 --> 00:16:12,679
I am well within my rights
as ranking medical officer.

227
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,412
He'll be out an hour or two.

228
00:16:14,788 --> 00:16:16,187
Well, what am I supposed to do?

229
00:16:17,658 --> 00:16:20,627
I don't care.
I have other patients to attend to.

230
00:16:37,244 --> 00:16:38,836
Something wrong?

231
00:16:41,482 --> 00:16:42,710
No, I'm fine.

232
00:16:44,385 --> 00:16:46,012
Good a place as any to stop and test.

233
00:16:50,524 --> 00:16:53,425
- I take it that's not good?
- No.

234
00:16:55,611 --> 00:16:57,545
I don't know. I think that...

235
00:16:57,647 --> 00:17:01,083
Hey, guys. Another negative over here.

236
00:17:01,784 --> 00:17:04,048
I'll radio Scott
and tell him we're moving on.

237
00:17:04,153 --> 00:17:07,919
Uh, yeah, but that's not what's going down.

238
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:11,952
- It's not?
- No.

239
00:17:12,061 --> 00:17:14,621
There are four other viable addresses
in this thing.

240
00:17:14,764 --> 00:17:17,392
I think I found an override
that'll allow us to dial from here...

241
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,197
- Yeah, but...
- Look around. This planet is a dead zone.

242
00:17:21,304 --> 00:17:22,566
- ELI: But...
- We should've been trying

243
00:17:22,672 --> 00:17:24,264
to dial these other planets from the start.

244
00:17:24,407 --> 00:17:26,898
- Rush said...
- We don't care what Rush said.

245
00:17:27,009 --> 00:17:28,476
We don't trust him.

246
00:17:28,744 --> 00:17:30,939
Rush doesn't want us all to die.

247
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,640
That doesn't mean we trust him
to make the right decisions.

248
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,612
You, too?

249
00:17:37,086 --> 00:17:38,280
What about the lake bed?

250
00:17:38,921 --> 00:17:40,889
It could be hundreds of miles from here.

251
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,754
We could be blowing our only chance
at finding a decent place to evac.

252
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,887
Maybe the ship did bring us here
because there's lime on this planet.

253
00:17:47,997 --> 00:17:51,489
For all we know, the Ancients had
a way of locating it that we don't.

254
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:53,262
For that matter, I'm sure
they could've stopped the ship

255
00:17:53,369 --> 00:17:56,497
for longer than 12 hours to find it
and recover it with the proper tools.

256
00:17:56,639 --> 00:17:59,608
The fact is, the Ancients
wouldn't have let the life-support system

257
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:01,506
get that screwed up in the first place.

258
00:18:01,644 --> 00:18:05,808
Rush is set on fixing the ship.
He's deaf to any other logic.

259
00:18:05,948 --> 00:18:08,815
We need to find a planet
we can survive on.

260
00:18:08,951 --> 00:18:10,578
This might be our last chance.

261
00:18:17,026 --> 00:18:18,516
Gotta keep going.

262
00:18:23,132 --> 00:18:26,192
Here. Take it.

263
00:18:26,869 --> 00:18:30,327
- I have my own.
- No, no. I can't go on.

264
00:18:30,907 --> 00:18:33,239
I'm never going to make it back.

265
00:18:33,376 --> 00:18:38,211
I know it's here.
You have to find it. Take it.

266
00:18:41,884 --> 00:18:45,581
- We're going to leave him here?
- I'll make my way back to the gate.

267
00:18:45,721 --> 00:18:47,245
- Go with him.
- I'm not leaving you here alone.

268
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:50,223
- Make sure he gets back alive.
- What difference does it make?

269
00:18:50,326 --> 00:18:52,521
Because if I don't find what we need,

270
00:18:52,628 --> 00:18:55,597
he's going to be the one to find
some other way to save his own ass,

271
00:18:55,731 --> 00:18:57,392
and yours along with it.

272
00:18:58,567 --> 00:18:59,932
You're losing it.

273
00:19:01,003 --> 00:19:02,265
I'll be okay.

274
00:19:05,608 --> 00:19:10,773
ON RADIO: Scott, this is Eli. Come in.
If you can hear me, please respond.

275
00:19:10,913 --> 00:19:12,278
This is Scott, what's up?

276
00:19:12,415 --> 00:19:16,476
We have a problem.
Franklin, Curtis, and Palmer have given up

277
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:20,055
and are headed back to the gate to try
dialing the other addresses in the remote.

278
00:19:20,156 --> 00:19:21,646
They also have the Kino.

279
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,554
They don't think
we're going to find the lime here.

280
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:26,321
They want to look for another planet
that will support life.

281
00:19:27,263 --> 00:19:28,423
They're going to get themselves killed.

282
00:19:28,531 --> 00:19:29,998
Don't we need the remote
to get back to the ship?

283
00:19:30,132 --> 00:19:34,228
That's not the point.
A few hours is nowhere near enough time

284
00:19:34,337 --> 00:19:39,536
to determine whether a planet is even
safe, let alone viable for sustaining life.

285
00:19:39,642 --> 00:19:43,738
The ship. The ship's our only real hope
of ever getting home.

286
00:19:47,283 --> 00:19:51,117
Stop them if you can.
I'll turn back when I have to.

287
00:19:51,887 --> 00:19:53,616
- Yes, sir.
- Go!

288
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:57,856
You lead.

289
00:19:59,028 --> 00:20:01,622
I'm sorry, excuse me.

290
00:20:01,764 --> 00:20:04,164
Miss Armstrong, we better be going soon.

291
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,892
You get my daughter home.

292
00:20:07,103 --> 00:20:09,503
Everyone is doing the best they can,
I assure you.

293
00:20:09,638 --> 00:20:10,764
That's not good enough.

294
00:20:10,873 --> 00:20:12,773
Mom, it's not his fault.

295
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:16,777
I'm a personal friend
of the President and of the First Lady.

296
00:20:16,879 --> 00:20:18,403
- Yes, ma'am.
- You tell your superiors

297
00:20:18,514 --> 00:20:22,177
if anything happens to her,
I will go public with what I know.

298
00:20:22,318 --> 00:20:23,945
Mom...

299
00:20:24,053 --> 00:20:25,452
I'm sorry, she's upset.

300
00:20:26,155 --> 00:20:30,421
My husband gave his life for my daughter.

301
00:20:30,526 --> 00:20:33,359
You get her back to me,
or the whole world is going to know

302
00:20:33,496 --> 00:20:36,294
what has really been going on
these past years.

303
00:21:58,364 --> 00:22:01,197
- RUSH: I need water.
- We're almost there.

304
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:04,658
I thought since I gave Scott my canteen,
we'd share.

305
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:07,170
And you were wrong about that.

306
00:22:07,272 --> 00:22:08,796
I should've known.

307
00:22:08,907 --> 00:22:12,502
Yeah? You think you know me pretty well,
don't you?

308
00:22:12,611 --> 00:22:16,513
I helped choose the personnel
for Icarus Base.

309
00:22:16,615 --> 00:22:18,515
I read your file.

310
00:22:18,617 --> 00:22:21,745
And neither you nor Captain Marvel
back there were on my list, I can tell you.

311
00:22:23,288 --> 00:22:24,414
You think I care?

312
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:26,148
Give me some water.

313
00:22:27,526 --> 00:22:29,016
Keep walking.

314
00:22:29,862 --> 00:22:31,659
You think just because you were born poor

315
00:22:31,764 --> 00:22:33,322
that it gives you the right
to be angry at the world.

316
00:22:33,432 --> 00:22:34,490
- How pathetic.
- Mmm, yeah, yeah.

317
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,431
You think that's why I'm angry?

318
00:22:36,568 --> 00:22:40,004
If it wasn't for the army,
you'd be in jail, or worse.

319
00:22:42,207 --> 00:22:44,038
That's what all you rich people think.

320
00:22:44,143 --> 00:22:48,102
Rich? My father worked
in the shipyards in Glasgow.

321
00:22:48,247 --> 00:22:51,876
I earned a scholarship to Oxford
while I was working two jobs.

322
00:22:51,984 --> 00:22:53,884
I have earned the right to make decisions

323
00:22:53,986 --> 00:22:56,352
without explaining myself to you
or anyone else.

324
00:22:56,455 --> 00:22:57,683
You give me some of that water!

325
00:22:58,991 --> 00:23:00,219
Keep walking.

326
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,789
You give me some of that water!

327
00:23:04,063 --> 00:23:07,191
- Don't you ever touch me.
- Give me some...

328
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:19,771
And you do that again,
and I'm gonna put a bullet

329
00:23:21,113 --> 00:23:22,944
- in your face.
- Oh, really?

330
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,310
I don't think so. You need me.

331
00:23:27,619 --> 00:23:29,553
Otherwise, you'd have gladly
done it by now.

332
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:36,656
Right now, I pray to the God above
that dehydration will shut you the hell up.

333
00:23:36,795 --> 00:23:41,095
Walk! Or die here! It's your choice,

334
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,658
Mr. Decision-maker.

335
00:23:52,511 --> 00:23:54,775
Looks like it's worth a shot to me.

336
00:23:55,514 --> 00:23:56,981
Let's do it.

337
00:23:57,116 --> 00:23:58,515
ELI: Wait!

338
00:24:00,986 --> 00:24:02,010
Stop!

339
00:24:02,154 --> 00:24:04,645
Look, it's not perfect,
but it's better than here.

340
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,623
Vegetation, water, air.
It's not too late for you to come with us.

341
00:24:07,726 --> 00:24:09,284
- Don't go.
- FRANKLIN: We'll dial back

342
00:24:09,394 --> 00:24:11,692
when we know
it's safe to evacuate everyone.

343
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,923
- ELI: You'll never get back home.
- You don't know that.

344
00:24:14,032 --> 00:24:16,796
Maybe there's a way we can use
the gate system to connect the dots.

345
00:24:16,902 --> 00:24:20,303
There has to be a reason
the ship locked out those addresses!

346
00:24:20,405 --> 00:24:22,305
Don't. Please.

347
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:36,813
Shoot him!

348
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,163
Why did you do that?

349
00:24:46,431 --> 00:24:47,659
He told me to.

350
00:24:52,905 --> 00:24:55,169
- I saved his life.
- By shooting him?

351
00:24:55,274 --> 00:24:56,468
He'll live.

352
00:24:59,745 --> 00:25:01,212
You just stranded Curtis and Palmer.

353
00:25:01,346 --> 00:25:04,213
We'll send them another remote.
I wasn't taking any chances.

354
00:25:04,349 --> 00:25:06,579
- Where's Scott?
- RUSH: Still looking for limestone.

355
00:25:07,853 --> 00:25:09,320
ELI: It's almost halftime.

356
00:25:09,454 --> 00:25:11,752
We only have six hours
before the ship leaves.

357
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:14,222
Lieutenant, this is Greer. Come in.

358
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:16,327
I hope he's turned back by now.

359
00:25:16,428 --> 00:25:20,159
Lieutenant! Come in.

360
00:26:10,015 --> 00:26:13,951
You must keep going, my boy.
Don't give up.

361
00:26:14,953 --> 00:26:17,421
I don't need you to tell me that.

362
00:26:25,964 --> 00:26:29,866
I'm not going to let anyone else down
the way I let you down.

363
00:26:30,636 --> 00:26:33,662
You really don't have to follow me around
to remind me.

364
00:26:35,007 --> 00:26:38,875
He has his plan for all of us.

365
00:26:47,152 --> 00:26:50,883
He's either out of radio range
or he's lying face-down in the sand,

366
00:26:51,023 --> 00:26:52,888
dead, or soon to be.

367
00:26:53,191 --> 00:26:54,852
I'm going back for him.

368
00:26:55,193 --> 00:26:59,061
- Well, that's great. Suicide.
- I'm not leaving him out here.

369
00:27:01,066 --> 00:27:02,897
- I'll go with you.
- No, no, you're just gonna slow me down.

370
00:27:03,035 --> 00:27:06,129
Look, this man has to get back to the ship.
He needs medical attention.

371
00:27:06,238 --> 00:27:10,038
Dial. He can take Franklin back.
You wait here for me.

372
00:27:10,175 --> 00:27:11,870
You have five hours to find him
and get back here.

373
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:14,308
Well, it's not been
a pleasure knowing you.

374
00:27:19,284 --> 00:27:21,844
- What do I need that for?
- Just in case.

375
00:27:21,953 --> 00:27:25,855
In case what?
I don't even know how to fire this thing.

376
00:27:32,564 --> 00:27:33,929
You'd better be here.

377
00:27:35,067 --> 00:27:36,261
I will.

378
00:27:46,978 --> 00:27:48,502
I have a gun.

379
00:27:55,887 --> 00:27:59,118
- Why do I feel like I've been drugged?
- Oh. Good to have you back, sir.

380
00:27:59,257 --> 00:28:01,020
Son of a...

381
00:28:01,126 --> 00:28:02,457
What the hell was Telford doing?

382
00:28:02,594 --> 00:28:05,688
Well... You're going to need this.

383
00:28:12,938 --> 00:28:14,371
BRODY: There they are.

384
00:28:14,473 --> 00:28:16,873
RILEY: Hurry up, hurry up.
Come on, help him, help him.

385
00:28:16,975 --> 00:28:18,203
BRODY: What happened?

386
00:28:18,944 --> 00:28:23,313
Greer... Greer shot him.
Water. Water.

387
00:28:27,085 --> 00:28:28,109
Hey.

388
00:28:31,256 --> 00:28:33,087
That was my ration for the day.

389
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,491
What's going on?

390
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:42,093
Oh, we've had a lovely day at the beach.
How about you?

391
00:29:18,003 --> 00:29:22,269
I have sinned, Father. I've failed you.

392
00:29:23,575 --> 00:29:25,099
I've failed him.

393
00:29:27,546 --> 00:29:29,309
I've failed myself.

394
00:29:30,849 --> 00:29:32,783
We have redemption through his blood.

395
00:29:50,202 --> 00:29:54,832
Curtis? Palmer? This is Eli.
If you can hear me, please come in.

396
00:29:59,244 --> 00:30:02,179
Curtis. Palmer. Please, respond.

397
00:30:15,927 --> 00:30:17,224
PRIEST: Do you love her?

398
00:30:19,064 --> 00:30:23,433
- SCOTT: She's not going to have it.
- You're certain?

399
00:30:23,735 --> 00:30:28,138
She's 16. We barely even know each other.

400
00:30:30,742 --> 00:30:32,767
What are you going to do?

401
00:30:34,546 --> 00:30:38,778
I don't know about anything.

402
00:30:40,719 --> 00:30:43,085
I thought He was my calling.

403
00:30:45,056 --> 00:30:46,489
But now...

404
00:30:54,165 --> 00:30:55,689
I am sorry.

405
00:30:57,736 --> 00:31:00,637
Why? I'm the one who's weak.

406
00:31:01,606 --> 00:31:02,903
It's my fault.

407
00:31:03,475 --> 00:31:05,409
No, it isn't.

408
00:31:06,511 --> 00:31:08,069
It's not yours.

409
00:32:13,812 --> 00:32:15,302
This is Scott! Come in!

410
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:21,143
I found it. I found the lake bed!

411
00:32:21,252 --> 00:32:22,981
I've got the lime!

412
00:32:26,091 --> 00:32:27,353
Oh, my God.

413
00:32:28,193 --> 00:32:32,289
If you can hear me, wait.
Just wait, I'm coming!

414
00:32:47,245 --> 00:32:48,542
Eli.

415
00:32:52,751 --> 00:32:54,082
Which way?

416
00:32:57,422 --> 00:32:58,719
Let's move out.

417
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:15,498
Scott...

418
00:34:25,009 --> 00:34:30,072
Come on. Ready? Drink.
Come on, come on, come on, man.

419
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:33,178
Take the bag.

420
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:35,846
There's no time!

421
00:34:36,688 --> 00:34:38,178
- You have to take it.
- Yes, you can.

422
00:34:38,323 --> 00:34:41,520
- No, I can't make it.
- Get the hell up! Come on!

423
00:34:43,027 --> 00:34:44,517
I can't make it.

424
00:34:46,698 --> 00:34:48,632
I can't carry you and this!

425
00:34:48,733 --> 00:34:51,600
Get your weak ass up! Come on!

426
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:53,867
Come on, soldier!

427
00:34:58,877 --> 00:35:01,345
Less than three minutes
before the ship jumps again.

428
00:35:01,479 --> 00:35:02,844
Incoming!

429
00:35:16,928 --> 00:35:21,388
- I'll stay.
- It's okay. I got it.

430
00:35:34,078 --> 00:35:37,013
- Sorry, sir.
- You did your best.

431
00:35:48,326 --> 00:35:49,554
Less than one minute.

432
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,569
I see them!

433
00:36:02,807 --> 00:36:04,741
They're carrying something!

434
00:36:04,843 --> 00:36:08,745
GREER: We've got it!
Don't go! We've got it!

435
00:36:08,847 --> 00:36:12,112
They've got the lime!
And they're not going to make it.

436
00:36:12,483 --> 00:36:13,609
Forty seconds.

437
00:36:16,421 --> 00:36:17,718
Give me the radio.

438
00:36:21,492 --> 00:36:26,088
Eli, I want you to stick your arm
into the event horizon of the puddle.

439
00:36:27,432 --> 00:36:28,558
Seriously?

440
00:36:28,666 --> 00:36:30,293
Are you sure?

441
00:36:30,435 --> 00:36:33,268
No. But I'm betting
there's some kind of safety protocol

442
00:36:33,371 --> 00:36:34,838
that prevents someone
getting cut off en route.

443
00:36:34,973 --> 00:36:36,406
And what if there isn't?

444
00:36:37,442 --> 00:36:38,602
Twenty seconds.

445
00:36:40,011 --> 00:36:41,478
Eli, do it now!

446
00:36:56,294 --> 00:36:58,023
Come on, man. Come on.

447
00:36:58,396 --> 00:36:59,920
Come on!

448
00:37:00,198 --> 00:37:04,259
Five, four, three, two, one!

449
00:37:28,326 --> 00:37:30,191
Eli, drink.

450
00:37:31,996 --> 00:37:34,897
YOUNG: Scott, look at me.
Lieutenant, look at me.

451
00:37:35,033 --> 00:37:36,796
Look at me! Look at me.

452
00:37:38,202 --> 00:37:39,567
Well done, Eli. Well done.

453
00:37:54,802 --> 00:37:57,202
In the quiet of a shadow

454
00:37:59,606 --> 00:38:01,733
In the corner of a room

455
00:38:04,678 --> 00:38:07,579
Darkness moves upon you

456
00:38:09,149 --> 00:38:11,777
Like a cloud across the moon

457
00:38:13,988 --> 00:38:16,786
You're a-wearing all the silence

458
00:38:16,924 --> 00:38:18,619
Look.

459
00:38:18,759 --> 00:38:21,250
Of a constant that will turn

460
00:38:23,497 --> 00:38:25,590
Like the windmill left deserted

461
00:38:28,302 --> 00:38:30,827
Or the sun forever burn

462
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:38,937
So don't forget to breathe

463
00:38:39,046 --> 00:38:41,981
Don't forget to breathe

464
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:45,318
Your whole life is here

465
00:38:45,452 --> 00:38:47,750
No eleventh-hour reprieve

466
00:38:47,855 --> 00:38:52,986
So don't forget to breathe

467
00:38:55,562 --> 00:38:58,156
Keep your head above water

468
00:38:58,298 --> 00:39:01,529
But don't forget to breathe

469
00:39:15,482 --> 00:39:17,450
I brought you some water.

470
00:39:18,886 --> 00:39:20,376
I still have some.

471
00:39:21,055 --> 00:39:23,216
- You really need to drink it.
- I'm fine.

472
00:39:29,263 --> 00:39:31,424
Everyone appreciates what you did.

473
00:39:34,401 --> 00:39:35,891
Rush say how long it will last?

474
00:39:37,538 --> 00:39:38,596
He's not sure.

475
00:39:42,042 --> 00:39:43,066
How are you?

476
00:39:53,387 --> 00:39:57,016
My parents died in a car crash
when I was four years old.

477
00:39:59,259 --> 00:40:02,751
- I'm sorry.
- And the priest who raised me,

478
00:40:04,565 --> 00:40:07,557
he pretty much drank himself to death
when I was 16.

479
00:40:08,001 --> 00:40:09,059
My God.

480
00:40:09,169 --> 00:40:13,936
I'm sorry. I'm not trying to diminish
what you're going through.

481
00:40:14,041 --> 00:40:17,033
- I... I know.
- I think my point is,

482
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,205
there's just some things
you never get over.

483
00:40:24,151 --> 00:40:25,379
That's just the way it is.

484
00:40:38,298 --> 00:40:39,560
You go on through.

485
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,335
As best as you can.

486
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:51,341
Don't forget to breathe

487
00:40:51,478 --> 00:40:55,744
Don't forget to breathe

488
00:40:56,116 --> 00:40:57,913
You know you are here

489
00:40:58,018 --> 00:41:00,350
But you find you want to leave

490
00:41:00,487 --> 00:41:07,359
So don't forget to breathe

491
00:41:11,498 --> 00:41:13,659
Just breathe

492
00:41:21,074 --> 00:41:23,269
Just breathe
