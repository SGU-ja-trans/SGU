1
00:00:03,136 --> 00:00:06,037
RUSH: Destiny.
The design is clearly Ancient.

2
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:08,300
Launched hundreds of thousands
of years ago.

3
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:09,966
SCOTT: Where the hell are we?

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,044
Several billion light years from home.

5
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:16,206
We are on a ship, but we have no idea
where we are in relation to Earth.

6
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:19,979
RUSH: This ship could be the most
important discovery mankind has made

7
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:21,417
since the stargate itself.

8
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,682
YOUNG: These are the wrong people
in the wrong place.

9
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,655
SCOTT: I've got a lot of wounded.
We need to get home.

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,555
RUSH: We barely have enough power
to operate the main systems.

11
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:31,822
This ship simply doesn't have
the capability to dial Earth.

12
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:35,927
In this case are
five Ancient communication stones.

13
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,005
RUSH: You physically take control
of an individual at the other end.

14
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:42,941
- Where are you?
- ELI: It's top secret.

15
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,069
- But did you get the letter from...
- Yeah, the Air Force, I got it.

16
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,806
You sound like you're in an airplane.

17
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:49,176
It's the kind of thing I always dreamed of.

18
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:50,442
Dad! No, wait!

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,144
CHLOE: The ship is old and damaged.

20
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:55,244
We were losing air and somebody had to...

21
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,579
He's dead, isn't he?

22
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:58,088
I didn't choose my job over you.

23
00:00:58,191 --> 00:00:59,317
It wasn't just about the job.

24
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,326
I want nothing more than
to get back here to be with you.

25
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:02,861
You made your choice, Everett.

26
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:24,645
You are so beautiful.

27
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,946
Don't.

28
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:34,325
I'm sorry. I never meant to hurt you.

29
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:46,668
SCOTT: Colonel...

30
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,837
Sorry, sir. They're waiting.

31
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,244
YOUNG: Sorry.

32
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,850
We're late.

33
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,730
- TELFORD: You're late.
- It's my fault.

34
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,482
Thanks for joining us, Colonel.

35
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,916
Sorry, sir, I wasn't expecting a party.

36
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,989
We may have figured out
a way to get you home.

37
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:41,321
Surprise.

38
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,505
WILLIAMS: Now, the power flow issues
are obviously the biggest variable,

39
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,472
but our simulations are encouraging.

40
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:05,244
It's time to take it to the next level.

41
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:07,909
Any questions?

42
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,685
It sounds dangerous.

43
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:13,225
The IOA fully supports
the implementation of this plan.

44
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,827
I've seen it for myself.

45
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,692
The situation on board is dire
and justifies the risk.

46
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,731
Look, I'm not going
to pretend to understand

47
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:20,924
everything you guys are talking about,

48
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:24,526
but it sounds like there's a chance
that this plan could end badly.

49
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:27,499
You want to get those people home.
So do we.

50
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,075
I'm just saying maybe these guys
could do a little more calculating.

51
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,666
The fact is, we are at the stage

52
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:34,474
where a practical attempt is the only
way to get any more hard data.

53
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,276
The goal is to save lives.

54
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,543
And we don't want to put the ship at risk.

55
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:41,017
All we're asking is that you try.

56
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:45,622
Well, this is something I would have
to take up with everyone on board.

57
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,750
Colonel, my office.

58
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,962
Look, if it makes you feel any better,

59
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,870
Colonel Carter saved my ass
dozens of times,

60
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:05,411
using all kinds of wacky science
I didn't understand.

61
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:08,776
Well, I can't force people
to do something they don't want to do.

62
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:11,145
You're in command of that ship.

63
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:12,983
It's not a democracy.

64
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,384
I'm sorry, sir, it's just...
It's not that simple.

65
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,217
Yes. Yes, it is.

66
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:20,125
A United States Senator is dead.

67
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:22,490
His daughter and dozens of other people

68
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,723
are trapped a billion light years
away from home.

69
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,225
The President wants it done.

70
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:31,503
Sir, with all due respect...

71
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,902
You are being given a direct order, Colonel.

72
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,066
And I'm telling you that,
regardless of the consequences

73
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:40,373
to my standing, I'm going
to take the situation under advisement.

74
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:43,038
I will let you know my decision tomorrow.

75
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:51,319
- Are you sure you don't want anything?
- I'm fine.

76
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:55,755
Thank you.

77
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,854
- Must be nice to get out, I imagine.
- It is.

78
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,693
Everyone's very impressed
with how you're holding up

79
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,325
under the circumstances.

80
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:04,733
I'm doing my best.

81
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:07,135
You're our eyes and ears now.

82
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,199
Your life, certainly the lives
of everyone aboard, is the first priority.

83
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,474
But you have to understand,
there's a lot at stake here.

84
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:19,447
You passed me up for promotion
four times.

85
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:22,682
I never really got
a straight answer as to why.

86
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:26,885
You are a highly trusted, well-respected
member of this organization.

87
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:30,087
You would not have been on Icarus
in the first place if you weren't.

88
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:31,424
The point is,

89
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:34,193
I know there's no way in hell
you'd be talking to me right now

90
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,165
if you had a choice.

91
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:39,637
So, please, can we just cut to the chase?

92
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:43,868
Make this happen.

93
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:45,805
I'm not a scientist.

94
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,402
- How can I do that?
- You have influence.

95
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,107
The people onboard need to
believe it'll get them home.

96
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:52,980
Even if, in reality, it can get us all killed.

97
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:56,522
- Not what I've been told.
- Why are you pushing so hard?

98
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,379
If this works,

99
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,956
we think we might be able to use the data
to re-engineer the process

100
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,586
in one of our ships here, in this galaxy.

101
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,632
Dial a gate to Destiny
without an Icarus-type planet.

102
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:12,433
Yes, and get the team that was supposed
to go in the first place back onboard.

103
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,403
Now that we know
where the ninth chevron leads,

104
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,134
this mission has taken on
even more importance.

105
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:17,709
Why isn't Rush here?

106
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,777
Ah.

107
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:22,479
We're not convinced
Rush wants to come home.

108
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:29,349
And do I have to remind you how much
you have to gain personally in all of this?

109
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,016
Assuming I live.

110
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,565
The ship doesn't have enough power
to dial back to Earth,

111
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:45,637
and as we've seen recently,
when the ship runs out of juice,

112
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,366
it finds a star and refills its tanks.

113
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:53,241
Now, theoretically, at that time, the full
power of the star should be available to us.

114
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,280
Star power. Ultimate wattage, baby.

115
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:57,542
Yeah, it's brilliant.

116
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:03,079
If we can somehow use the ship as
a conduit and channel the star's energy

117
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,781
into the gate as we dial...

118
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,518
That would do it?

119
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,322
The problem is
the whole ship is a conduit part.

120
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,762
Well, does anyone know when the ship
will run out of power again?

121
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,230
It's tough to tell.

122
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:18,064
Based on current usage,
probably going to be several months.

123
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:20,271
Not if we can drain the power faster.

124
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:23,342
Right, that's part of the plan
that sounded a little vague.

125
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,603
- It's possible.
- So, you guys are saying

126
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,473
you're all for this?

127
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,008
Let's see what Rush says.

128
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,413
Given how little we know about this ship...

129
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:35,180
Can't we at least try it,
and abort if something goes wrong?

130
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,348
Well, unfortunately,
the "something goes wrong" part

131
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,858
would most likely mean
the ship exploding.

132
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,053
Not according to the people
who came up with the idea.

133
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,255
Well, if only all science
was that definitive, Colonel.

134
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:49,061
You're just going to have to choose
who you want to believe.

135
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,066
Nothing to worry about.
It doesn't hurt at all.

136
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,768
- Do I look worried?
- A little.

137
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,442
Just trying to figure out
what I'm going to say to my mom.

138
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:03,606
My family thinks
I'm on sabbatical in Africa.

139
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:06,879
So, when it's time to come back,
what do I do, click my heels three times?

140
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,216
RILEY: There's no way for you
to disconnect the transmission yourself.

141
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,256
The base needs to be manually shut down.

142
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:12,654
There's a device on the other side as well,

143
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:15,158
and turning either off
will sever the connection.

144
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,354
- Pretty cool.
- RILEY: Easiest way to swap consciousness

145
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,693
with someone across the universe
I've ever seen.

146
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:23,394
- What's with the Kino?
- First time using the stones.

147
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:25,593
Very exciting.

148
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,015
Any chance I could get something else
to wear?

149
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,316
Wow, check me out.

150
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:48,149
Okay, this is weird.

151
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,126
The people we're in can't hear us,
can they?

152
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,218
No.

153
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,294
Wonder what they're doing
with our bodies.

154
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,272
- Colonel Telford.
- I'll just get right to it.

155
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,747
I've been ordered to enact the rescue plan
put forward by the IOA.

156
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,545
- Rescue plan?
- I don't understand.

157
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,552
I've brought Doctors McCormack
and Williams with me.

158
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:15,951
- I believe you know them.
- Yes.

159
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:19,650
- I've already set them to work.
- What about Colonel Young?

160
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:23,689
Effective immediately,
I'm assuming command of the Destiny.

161
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,233
YOUNG: You replaced me.
O'NEILL: For now.

162
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,633
- Without waiting to hear my answer?
- You were going to say...

163
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,795
Give us more time.

164
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,237
Then you were going to be
disobeying a direct order.

165
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,706
- Sir...
- Look,

166
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,403
I offered you command of the expedition.

167
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:42,640
You were my first choice,
but you turned it down.

168
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:47,343
Your exact words, as I recall, were,
"I don't think it's still in me, sir."

169
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:50,115
Well, I'm there now, sir,
whether I like it or not,

170
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:53,214
whether anyone likes it.
This is wrong, and you know it.

171
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,953
I've spent most of my career
looking up to you,

172
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,392
because you always did the right thing,

173
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,224
even if it meant disregarding
the chain of command.

174
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:01,164
Colonel, don't think I like this.

175
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:06,038
- They can't do this to us, can they?
- YOUNG: For now, they have.

176
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,834
Look, I think it comes down to
the fact that they don't trust Rush,

177
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,932
and the truth is, I can't blame them.

178
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,442
What are we supposed to do?

179
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,479
Well, they've given you permission
to see your families

180
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,639
as long as you guys follow the rules.

181
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,580
Look, I hate to go there,

182
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:22,450
but what happens if they screw up
and the ship explodes?

183
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,046
Most likely, we will die here, too.

184
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,721
Look, apparently they're just doing
some preliminary testing,

185
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,493
information gathering, nothing too crazy.

186
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,969
So, what you're saying is,
live it up while we can.

187
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:56,521
- Colonel Telford, I presume.
- Sergeant.

188
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:13,670
He can use the facilities. That's it.

189
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:19,843
And what if the power flow
can't be controlled?

190
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:22,937
Well, if there are any dangerous
fluctuations, we just shut it down

191
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,108
and allow the ship
to continue powering up.

192
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:27,811
Early tests show it should work.

193
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,888
We are not going to be putting you
in any more danger

194
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,014
than you're already in just being here.

195
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:34,217
McCORMACK: From what I gather,
supplies are desperately short.

196
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:35,691
And given the condition of the ship,

197
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:38,355
it could experience a fatal breakdown
at any time.

198
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:41,331
No one is trying to alarm you unduly,

199
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:44,631
but we can't continue to scrape by,
barely surviving.

200
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:48,867
Obviously, we can't say for sure
that this is going to get you home,

201
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:51,909
but the best minds that we have
are working on this,

202
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:57,608
and I'm sure you'll agree
it's well worth pursuing.

203
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:10,924
Dr. Rush.

204
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:12,925
Colonel.

205
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:17,298
- It is spectacular, isn't it?
- Yes.

206
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:21,196
If this plan has any chance at succeeding...

207
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,434
Which it doesn't.

208
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:27,945
Control over most of the ship's
operational systems is limited, at best.

209
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,474
Navigation, propulsion, and many
others have been locked out entirely

210
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:35,213
by a master code,
which we have had no luck in breaking.

211
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:38,187
I thought you might want to know we've
come up with a way of draining the power.

212
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,882
Yes, so I heard.

213
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,661
Many of the power conduits
have been badly damaged,

214
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,663
and firing the ship's weapons system

215
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:49,166
without either repairing them
or isolating the damaged areas

216
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,963
would be prohibitively dangerous.

217
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,732
That's what we're working on right now.

218
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:57,073
Just wanted to keep you informed.

219
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,070
She's not going to understand.

220
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,149
She can barely follow
an episode of Star Trek.

221
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:07,076
You don't have to tell her.

222
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,249
- Yes?
- Hi.

223
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,957
- I...
- Can I help you?

224
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:22,095
My name is Phillip.

225
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,199
Phillip Fry. I work with your son.

226
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,602
You know Eli?

227
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:30,174
We've recently become very close.

228
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,152
It doesn't feel real.

229
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:50,658
It's like a bad dream.

230
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,529
You're here.

231
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:03,574
If this is the only way, I can live with that.

232
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,268
I can't stay this way forever, Mom.

233
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,972
I know.

234
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:13,142
Everyone's working very hard
to get you home.

235
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,618
I'm trying to get through this.

236
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,281
I am.

237
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,461
- Your father always used to say...
- One step at a time.

238
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,160
I miss him so much.

239
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,431
Me, too.

240
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:37,666
Awesome, thanks.

241
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,240
Eli drinks four or five of those a day.

242
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,781
- Actually, he quit.
- Really?

243
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,649
- I find that hard to believe.
- He's on a bit of a crash diet.

244
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,815
You may not recognize him
next time you see him.

245
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:54,518
- When will that be? Do you know?
- I'm sorry, I'm not sure.

246
00:14:56,095 --> 00:15:00,225
- Really getting into shape, though.
- Can I get you something to eat?

247
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,536
Eli said you make the most
amazing chocolate chip cookies.

248
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:07,905
- He told you that?
- Oh, yeah.

249
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:11,937
It's crazy how close you get
in such a short time.

250
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:15,571
Sometimes it's like
he's just right up there, in my brain.

251
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:20,285
Why don't I make some?
You can take them back with you.

252
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,455
He also said you make a mean schnitzel,
but I don't want to put you out.

253
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,423
No, I'm happy to do it.

254
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:31,895
You know,
I thought he'd be calling more often.

255
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,862
Here, let me help you.

256
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:40,570
Tell me, this work you're doing...

257
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:47,738
- I know you can't tell me much about it.
- I can tell you that it's important.

258
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:51,475
In fact, it could change the world
as we know it.

259
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,244
Really? My Eli?

260
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,147
Not that I'm surprised,
don't get me wrong.

261
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:00,714
He's my son. Of course I think he's special.

262
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,919
He was always so bright, so different,

263
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:07,362
but he just...
He never seemed to apply himself.

264
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,835
Some of it was my fault.

265
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:15,640
No. He doesn't blame you at all,
for anything.

266
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,610
I'm sorry if this is personal,
but he told me you're not well.

267
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:24,775
Did he?

268
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,457
Lucky guess.

269
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:38,089
Eggs are in the fridge, right?

270
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:46,063
I didn't think
he ever talked to anyone about it.

271
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,866
He asked me to make sure the Air Force

272
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,635
was making good on their promise
to help you.

273
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:54,179
To be honest, the whole thing
makes me a little anxious.

274
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,873
I really just want to know Eli's okay.

275
00:16:58,584 --> 00:16:59,710
He is.

276
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:05,521
You make sure you tell him
I'm proud of him.

277
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:11,590
I will.

278
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,132
I'm sorry.

279
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:22,767
It's just... It all happened so suddenly,

280
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,867
and I miss him.

281
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:31,310
He misses you, too.

282
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,451
RILEY: That's it for me.

283
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:44,461
BRODY: I'm almost done over here.

284
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,124
You're stalling.

285
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,133
I'm doing things
the way they need to be done.

286
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:53,568
Now, we've isolated power to 40%
of the operational weapons system,

287
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:58,371
and it should be good enough to get us
a read on our power reduction capability.

288
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:03,471
- The next time we drop out of FTL...
- Look, look, this ship is old and damaged.

289
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,750
The computers aren't registering
half the things they're supposed to.

290
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:09,616
I want manual confirmation before

291
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:11,689
activating any system
that comprehensive.

292
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:15,920
Over 80% of this ship is inaccessible
without spacesuits right now.

293
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:18,823
With only two suits,
doing it your way could take months.

294
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,057
If that's what it takes.

295
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,398
- Dr. Rush, we're ready here.
- RUSH: Okay, sending power through.

296
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,539
Riley?

297
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,206
RUSH: Looks like a coolant leak.
BRODY: I thought you got it.

298
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,648
Yeah, so did I.

299
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:42,413
There's a problem.
Power's backing up in the relay.

300
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,489
- Shut it down.
- I'm trying. It's not working.

301
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,888
The problem is contained.
It's restricted to that corridor.

302
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,118
That's not the point.

303
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,695
How big an explosion
are we talking about?

304
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,889
RILEY: I'm going in. I can seal it.

305
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:55,660
Are you crazy? You can't go in there!
We're on the hull!

306
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,610
- Rush!
- We are in FTL!

307
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:08,805
If it punctures the hull,
disrupts the shield at all,

308
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,883
even for a microsecond,
then the entire ship could be in jeopardy.

309
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,482
Riley!

310
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:38,042
It's... It's going to be touch and go.

311
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:57,957
We're proceeding with the test
next time we drop out of FTL.

312
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:01,192
Colonel, the man nearly died.

313
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,858
You're the one who put him in jeopardy.

314
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,027
I was trying to make sure
you didn't kill us all.

315
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,331
I'm not going to.

316
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:09,771
Look, I accept responsibility
for what happened,

317
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,673
but you forced the situation,
and activating the weapons system

318
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,975
the way you're proposing
is completely reckless.

319
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:18,276
Come on, Rush,
these people are in danger just being here,

320
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,544
evidenced by what just happened.

321
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:22,210
This ship is falling apart.

322
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,585
They're the wrong people for this.
We need to get them home.

323
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,214
Yeah, well, there's a right way
of doing that.

324
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,520
We are doing it the right way.

325
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,087
That's a matter of opinion.

326
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,731
Look, I know that we've had
our differences in the past.

327
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,960
Yeah, you wanted me
off the expedition team. I remember.

328
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,163
It was my duty to express concern
for how everyone else felt about you.

329
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,763
So are you suggesting that my judgment

330
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:47,140
is now somehow clouded,
or is it that I'm just plain lying?

331
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:52,775
Admit it, Rush,
after everything that's happened,

332
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:56,851
you're afraid
they're not going to let you come back.

333
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:13,434
- Hello?
- CHLOE: Hey, it's me.

334
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:16,630
- How's it going?
- Okay.

335
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:18,769
How'd your mom take it?

336
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:21,311
Couldn't do it. I told her I was a co-worker.

337
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:23,980
I told my friends
I'm Cousin Liz from out west.

338
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,513
I may have oversold the job.

339
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:31,282
I said I was going to change
everything for mankind as we know it.

340
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,357
What the hell, right?

341
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:36,388
Might as well make her feel
like I left for a good reason.

342
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:37,484
You did.

343
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,556
Right. I guess so.

344
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,426
So, some of my old friends

345
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:46,470
are taking Cousin Liz out on the town
to see Janelle Monáe.

346
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,664
- You want to come hang out with us?
- Hell yes.

347
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:10,985
Emily, it's me.

348
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:13,630
Emily. Hey, no. Emily!

349
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,563
Emily, please just open the door.

350
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,498
- Go away!
- I'm not leaving, Emily.

351
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,729
- I'm not going to leave you.
- I will call the police, Everett.

352
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,136
Emily, please.
It doesn't end like this, Emily!

353
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,004
Open the door! I just want to talk to you!

354
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,575
Hey, just...
I need you to just listen to me, okay?

355
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,846
Because I know this is crazy.

356
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:37,785
I'm barely keeping it together,

357
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:41,723
and the only thing that's keeping me
from going out of my mind is you.

358
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:44,921
That's making me crazy, too,
because I know how much I hurt you

359
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,760
and I know that you hate me for leaving.

360
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,130
Emily, I really tried.
I didn't want to come here.

361
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:53,261
I tried not to come here,
but I can't stand it!

362
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:56,264
Baby, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, and I love you so much.

363
00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:00,311
Please, just... I had to try, all right?
Just in case there was a chance.

364
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:02,778
A chance that you could forgive me.

365
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:07,216
Maybe you're just afraid,
thinking that I would die out there,

366
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:13,451
so it's easier for you to just push me
away now than have to face me like this.

367
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:17,324
I just want to come home to you,
and that's all I want.

368
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,061
We're dancing free
but we're stuck here underground

369
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:57,198
And everybody trying
to figure they way out

370
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:03,636
Hey, hey, hey, all we ever wanted to say

371
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,334
Hi.

372
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:11,516
Me?

373
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,418
- What's your name?
- Phil.

374
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:17,453
- Can I buy you a drink?
- I have one.

375
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,889
Yes, you do.

376
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,794
- Want to dance?
- Sure.

377
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:31,360
Oh, my God, this is awesome!

378
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,104
Oh, make it rain, ain't a thang
and the sky to fall

379
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:36,868
The silver bullet's in your hand
and the war's heating up

380
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:40,467
And when the truth goes bang
The shouts splatter out

381
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:43,275
Revolutionize your lives and find a way out

382
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:46,509
And when you're growing down
instead of growing up

383
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:48,950
You gotta ooh, ah, like a panther

384
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:52,581
Tell me, are you bold enough
to reach for love?

385
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:09,836
Hey, we're going to go dance.
You guys want to come?

386
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,197
No.

387
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:18,749
So, how long have Celina and Josh
been together?

388
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,283
I don't know.

389
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,490
- Too bad about Chloe's dad, huh?
- Yeah.

390
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,921
- What's she going to do?
- What do you mean?

391
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,291
Well, her job.
She was working for him, right?

392
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:36,028
I don't really think
that's on her mind right now.

393
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,826
Sure.

394
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:42,096
- Well, tell her we're sorry.
- I will.

395
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,437
You know, it sucks for me,

396
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,809
because Senator Armstrong was hooking
me up with his Wall Street connections,

397
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:51,382
and now that's not going to happen.

398
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,782
I think I have to go throw up.

399
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:14,830
Hey.

400
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,564
Hey.

401
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:20,008
- So, is Chloe really okay?
- She'll be fine.

402
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:25,145
- I wish she'd call me back.
- I'm sure she misses you.

403
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:29,545
I think she's just having a hard time
dealing right now.

404
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:33,090
It's just... I really need to talk to her.
You know?

405
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:36,822
You mean about the fact
that you're sleeping with her boyfriend?

406
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,054
- What?
- It's pretty obvious

407
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:39,152
you guys are together.

408
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,164
Look, Josh and Chloe broke up.

409
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,824
Yeah, I don't think
she ever would have suspected

410
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,526
that you're the real reason why.

411
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:47,935
- I don't know who you...
- How could you do this to me?

412
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:50,974
- To you?
- You're supposed to be her best friend!

413
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:53,044
Get your hands off of me.

414
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:13,790
Excuse me, Colonel? Can I have a word?

415
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:15,731
One moment.

416
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:18,101
About Sergeant Greer...

417
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,294
Colonel Telford?

418
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:22,640
EMILY: Oh, baby...

419
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,379
Scott, it's Young.

420
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:33,179
- What just happened?
- We just dropped out of FTL, sir.

421
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:34,444
What's going on?

422
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:36,850
It must have disrupted communication
between the stones.

423
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:40,015
Scott, listen to me, we don't have
a lot of time. You've got to...

424
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:43,185
Colonel Young? Colonel Young!

425
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,529
Oh, baby...

426
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,103
- What just happened?
- We just dropped out of FTL.

427
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:03,808
Looks like it might have temporarily
disrupted the communication device.

428
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:05,644
We have to fix that.

429
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,542
Sir, I think Colonel Young wanted me
to shut down the stones.

430
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:11,554
This is no longer his command,
is that clear?

431
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:14,487
The device stays on.

432
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:22,095
A glitch?
That's one hell of a glitch, General.

433
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,465
That's what I'm being told, Colonel.
They're working on it.

434
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,130
Yes, sir. Just let me know.

435
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:32,643
They said it was some sort of glitch.

436
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:35,269
Apparently. It won't happen again.

437
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,678
- How do they know?
- I don't know.

438
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:39,916
Right now, I don't care.

439
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,581
Did you see that girl I was dancing with?

440
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:45,883
She wrote her e-mail address on my hand.

441
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:49,084
I hate this. I hate everybody.

442
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:51,623
Hey, Captain Buzzkill.

443
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,324
Whoa! Okay, no more drinks for Cousin Liz.

444
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,494
You see those two over there?

445
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:02,198
That's my best friend, Celina,
and my ex-boyfriend.

446
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:04,968
You can do better.

447
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,078
Do you want to dance?

448
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,638
I think I want to go over there
and punch him in the face.

449
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,447
Hey, hey! I have an idea.

450
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:18,348
How about we get out of here?

451
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:19,879
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

452
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:22,516
- Easy.
- This is awful.

453
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:25,219
I'm not even drunk at all.

454
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,861
Really? Because you seem drunk.

455
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:31,531
- My head's just all foggy.
- Almost there.

456
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:36,865
Usually it makes me feel better,
at least for a little while.

457
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:40,211
It usually makes me dizzy,
and then I fall asleep.

458
00:29:40,246 --> 00:29:43,840
It usually makes me dizzy,
and then I fall asleep.

459
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:59,427
Just once I'd like to go out with a girl
and not have it end with her crying.

460
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:03,331
My life was so shallow and pointless,

461
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,499
and then I started working with my dad.

462
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:13,370
I really thought that I could do something,
make a difference.

463
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:15,106
You can.

464
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:19,006
These aren't even my tears!

465
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:21,548
I'm sorry.

466
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:25,555
If it makes you feel better,
I had a really great time tonight.

467
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:28,654
I'm glad.

468
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:36,060
Do you know the last time
a girl that hot told me I was cute?

469
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:38,761
Never.

470
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:42,738
Doesn't it bother you that
she wasn't really talking about you?

471
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:45,932
Well, when you put it like that...

472
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,171
Oh.

473
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:51,043
I didn't mean that. Come on.

474
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,614
You're cute. The real you.

475
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,657
- What?
- Nothing.

476
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:10,097
Go on. You were saying...

477
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:15,930
And you're funny, too.
And you're a genius. And...

478
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,036
- Don't say it.
- ...you're a good friend.

479
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:23,037
Yes.

480
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:27,711
That's me. I am a good friend.

481
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:33,883
I don't want to be trapped on that ship,
and I don't want to be stuck here like this.

482
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,024
I can't feel anything. Can you?

483
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:39,325
- Well...
- You know what's the worst part

484
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,022
about having a father like mine?

485
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:44,397
- Whoa, how did we get onto that?
- You can't live up to it.

486
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:47,400
He was so great.

487
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:51,164
I'll never be like he was.

488
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:56,739
My dad definitely would have
punched Josh in the face!

489
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,978
Wow. I think I'm going to take you home.

490
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:03,219
Could you take me home?

491
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:20,367
A lot of people are behind this.

492
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:24,967
Well, a lot of people play the lottery.

493
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:28,068
What's surprising is
they'd do it with their lives.

494
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:32,081
I know you're opposed.
I have serious concerns myself.

495
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:39,115
I'm just wondering how much safer
it might be if you were involved.

496
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,706
They can't keep me
locked up in here forever.

497
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,773
You know he will, as long as he can.

498
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:04,475
- What you did...
- He had it coming to him.

499
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,684
Look, just shut down
the damn stones, man.

500
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:09,377
I'm not you, Ron.

501
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,452
- He's our commanding officer.
- Colonel Young

502
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:16,653
- is our commanding officer.
- Telford's got guards posted 24/7.

503
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:22,058
- What am I supposed to do?
- This better work.

504
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:36,708
What are you doing?

505
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:38,708
I'm making sure
we still have enough power

506
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:42,081
to control these consoles
when approaching the star.

507
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:46,952
Dr. Williams says you've come up with
a way of improving the odds of success.

508
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:49,856
- Well, I don't want to die, Colonel.
- Good.

509
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:54,063
Hopefully, we've proven
that's not our goal.

510
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:11,778
I'm sorry.

511
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:17,950
I couldn't deal with it, the thought of you
being trapped on that ship, with her.

512
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,751
Emily, what do I have to do?

513
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:22,621
And I shouldn't have brought it up again.

514
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:26,288
I know it's over,
but you got to understand...

515
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:31,729
Everett?

516
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:34,696
No...

517
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:38,634
- Rush, what's happening?
- We just jumped to FTL.

518
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:44,373
Rush?

519
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:48,008
- Colonel Telford?
- Yes.

520
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:51,345
Everything okay?

521
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:54,957
It will be soon enough.

522
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:06,997
All right, this is ridiculous.

523
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,597
Jumping back and forth without any
warning is completely unacceptable!

524
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,077
Seriously.

525
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:43,530
Routing power flow to the stargate.

526
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,609
Ready to attempt dial in.

527
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:47,604
Do it.

528
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:43,666
SCOTT: All right, stand back!
Everyone, back up!

529
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:49,100
BRODY: You're going to overload
the capacitors.

530
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,231
Bringing power flow down.

531
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:56,002
BRODY: The limitations are not holding.

532
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:58,638
Because the system wasn't meant
to handle this much power.

533
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:13,358
- Stay calm!
- The shield is failing.

534
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:14,988
Colonel, we need to abort.

535
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:20,303
Shut it down!

536
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:27,969
It's not working.

537
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:34,444
- I thought you said you could stop it!
- I know! It won't shut down.

538
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,626
Where the hell are you going?

539
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,473
SCOTT: Do something.

540
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,086
BRODY: They're gone.

541
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:12,452
Thank you.

542
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,004
If I can have everyone's attention, please.

543
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:37,479
I'm sorry to have to tell you that
we will not be going home.

544
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:44,254
Not yet, anyway, but you can all relax
and return to your quarters.

545
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:48,714
The ship will not be exploding,
at least not today.

546
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:52,924
Normal power levels
will be restored soon, right?

547
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:54,488
Yes.

548
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,930
Thank you.

549
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:06,868
You staged the whole thing.

550
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,575
So all of this was just to get rid of Telford?

551
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:11,705
Had to be done.

552
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:14,979
So you're saying that the ship
was never going to explode?

553
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:19,022
Oh, no, we would most definitely all be
dead had I not put certain limits in place.

554
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:23,723
I also arranged for the alarms
and warnings to go off regardless.

555
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:26,763
Bit of theater, always nice.

556
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,694
- Their plan was never going to work.
- You could have warned us.

557
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:34,396
You scared the crap out of everybody.

558
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:38,131
Well, I didn't know
who was on my side, did I?

559
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:50,543
YOUNG: Colonel Telford removed not only
any sense of command,

560
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:53,953
but the two scientists that designed
and implemented the program

561
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,082
that was causing the crisis.

562
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:57,456
The situation appeared to be irreversible.

563
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:00,826
Fortunately, Dr. Rush was able
to avoid catastrophic disaster.

564
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:02,296
Yes, and we'd like to see how he did that,

565
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,891
along with the rest of the data
collected during the experiment.

566
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:08,369
Those were people's lives
you were experimenting with.

567
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:11,373
- We were trying to get them home.
- You cut and ran.

568
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:15,878
There's no point in three more lives
being lost if it could be avoided.

569
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,840
Colonel Telford was following orders.

570
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:22,343
YOUNG: Sir, after much consideration,

571
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:24,978
we have decided
to stay in communication with Earth.

572
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:28,149
I hope personal visits for everyone onboard
will still be permitted.

573
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,022
That depends, Colonel.

574
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:33,159
- Consider it done.
- YOUNG: Thank you, sir.

575
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:38,091
I'm afraid the time that I've allotted
for this briefing is now up.

576
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:42,233
General.

577
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:53,342
We are going to have to
be tough. Disciplined.

578
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:57,485
The road may be longer
than many of us hoped.

579
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:03,093
We will have to sacrifice, compromise,

580
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:06,755
work together without exceptions.

581
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:16,767
I thought you did a good job.

582
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:21,171
People need to know the truth,
but they also need hope.

583
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:26,544
- I need you to do something for me.
- Sure thing.

584
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,084
Go over the data collected
as they tried to dial the gate.

585
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:30,676
I have already.

586
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,144
There's a lot I don't understand...

587
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:36,090
Well, then you need to learn, as fast as you
can, and you talk to whoever you have to.

588
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:38,690
You think Rush is hiding something?

589
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:41,230
That's what I want you to tell me.

590
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:58,003
YOUNG: We are going to survive.
We are going to make it home.

591
00:41:58,482 --> 00:41:59,710
Make no mistake.

592
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:06,278
My first priority is to make sure
that we all return to those we love.
