1
00:00:02,184 --> 00:00:05,483
<i>This is what Destiny intended from
the moment it entered the star system.</i>

2
00:00:05,554 --> 00:00:08,921
<i>That ship is the best chance
we have of getting home.</i>

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,514
- Are we done?
- We'll never be done.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,187
<i>You shouldn't have
left him on the planet.</i>

5
00:00:14,261 --> 00:00:16,024
<i>You think I don't know that?</i>

6
00:00:16,097 --> 00:00:19,624
<i>Everyone thinks we're safe.
They think that they'll never find us again.</i>

7
00:00:19,733 --> 00:00:21,325
Why did you take
one of our people prisoner?

8
00:00:23,304 --> 00:00:24,895
<i>We're not safe, are we?</i>

9
00:00:24,971 --> 00:00:26,700
They're coming!
- Who's coming?

10
00:00:26,773 --> 00:00:28,434
<i>Lucian Alliance,
they're coming to take Destiny.</i>

11
00:00:28,608 --> 00:00:30,439
<i>There's only one way
this is gonna end if we wait.</i>

12
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,501
<i>I'm not
surrendering this ship.</i>

13
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:33,876
<i>I've managed to find a clue</i>

14
00:00:33,947 --> 00:00:36,211
<i>which may give us control of this
ship once and for all.</i>

15
00:00:36,282 --> 00:00:38,613
It's the number of chromosomes
in the human DNA.

16
00:00:38,684 --> 00:00:40,584
All we have to do now
is run through the variations.

17
00:00:40,686 --> 00:00:42,711
I was never your conscience, Nicholas.

18
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:44,582
I haven't forgotten you, Gloria.

19
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:58,095
<i>There can only be one
commander, and Kiva's dead.</i>

20
00:00:58,536 --> 00:01:00,094
What are we doing to get the ship back?

21
00:01:14,317 --> 00:01:15,341
They're going to kill me.

22
00:01:24,326 --> 00:01:26,294
I thought you were
going to get some sleep.

23
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,254
Yeah, so did I.

24
00:01:34,536 --> 00:01:36,060
What's going on here, then?

25
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:39,038
Some sort of crash.
The interface is frozen.

26
00:01:39,107 --> 00:01:40,438
Yeah? Why didn't you call me?

27
00:01:40,508 --> 00:01:43,341
Well, I was going to try a restart first.
That's fixed it in the past.

28
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:50,339
- What did you just do?
- Seems I fixed the problem.

29
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,317
- Yeah, I can see that. How?
- Good night, Dr. Park.

30
00:01:53,387 --> 00:01:55,048
Glad to see
you have everything well in hand.

31
00:01:55,122 --> 00:01:56,714
Wait, where are you going?

32
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,089
For a walk.
You get into trouble next time, call me.

33
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,748
You're not going to tell anyone,
are you?

34
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:47,787
- Gloria.
- Your program finally worked.

35
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:52,754
Unlocked the master code.

36
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:57,632
<i>You found the keys to controlling all of
Destiny's systems, everything.</i>

37
00:04:02,206 --> 00:04:05,141
And you're not going to tell anyone,
are you?

38
00:04:19,656 --> 00:04:23,319
Ancient legend said the address
led to great understanding.

39
00:04:23,393 --> 00:04:25,553
It could make you as powerful as the Gods.

40
00:04:26,796 --> 00:04:27,990
Which Gods?

41
00:04:29,865 --> 00:04:34,302
Don't ask me.
I assume it meant God-like power.

42
00:04:34,704 --> 00:04:36,467
Like the ascended Ancients.

43
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:39,439
If you could control time and space...

44
00:04:39,507 --> 00:04:43,034
<i>Wait. You think that
Destiny is capable of that?</i>

45
00:04:43,845 --> 00:04:46,871
I don't know. That's what the legend said.

46
00:04:49,884 --> 00:04:54,047
You asked me why the Lucian Alliance
wanted the ship so badly.

47
00:04:55,589 --> 00:04:56,647
Why are you here?

48
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,790
I'm trying to understand your perspective.

49
00:05:03,664 --> 00:05:07,360
You really want me to go over
the last 12 or 13 years?

50
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:10,400
The how and the why
of the Lucian Alliance?

51
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:13,732
They're warlords.

52
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,974
On my home planet,
they would burn our farms,

53
00:05:17,043 --> 00:05:20,342
so we had nothing to eat
but the food they supplied.

54
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,679
They told our teachers what to teach.

55
00:05:22,748 --> 00:05:25,581
Children were given weapons
and trained to fight.

56
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:31,321
Two years ago,
I was taken by a gang at gunpoint

57
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:35,792
and told if I didn't join the Alliance
Guard my family was going to be murdered.

58
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:43,491
So, you're saying that
you had no choice in any of this?

59
00:05:48,105 --> 00:05:49,935
We're not getting enough food.

60
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,264
None of us are.

61
00:05:52,442 --> 00:05:56,173
We haven't been able to replenish
our supplies in some time.

62
00:05:56,413 --> 00:05:57,903
You're saying we could all starve?

63
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,072
Yes.

64
00:06:01,718 --> 00:06:04,117
What are you going to do with us?

65
00:06:04,186 --> 00:06:06,450
You can't keep us locked
in that hold forever.

66
00:06:07,256 --> 00:06:09,349
That hasn't been determined yet.

67
00:06:11,627 --> 00:06:14,619
Colonel Young,
he's going to make that decision?

68
00:06:16,565 --> 00:06:18,225
I will have a say.

69
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:21,231
Some of us have been co-operative.

70
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:22,959
Yes, you have.

71
00:06:23,438 --> 00:06:25,406
There is more we can do.

72
00:06:25,473 --> 00:06:28,670
There are those among us
who are no danger to you.

73
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:34,069
Please, give us a chance
to prove it to you.

74
00:06:51,997 --> 00:06:53,157
What are they going to do with us?

75
00:06:54,834 --> 00:06:56,665
They didn't tell me anything.
I'm a traitor.

76
00:06:57,203 --> 00:06:59,535
You know Young. What will he do?

77
00:07:00,505 --> 00:07:03,531
I used to know him. Trust me, he's changed.

78
00:07:15,752 --> 00:07:17,879
You've got to be kidding me.

79
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:22,515
It's hardly worth sitting down.

80
00:07:22,593 --> 00:07:25,585
Yeah, maybe we shouldn't be
giving our rations to the enemy.

81
00:07:25,662 --> 00:07:28,358
They're human beings. They have rights.

82
00:07:28,432 --> 00:07:29,557
How we treat prisoners of war

83
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:32,658
says everything about us
as a moral and civil society.

84
00:07:35,171 --> 00:07:36,900
Which pamphlet did you get that from?

85
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:39,536
It's what I believe.

86
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,170
I don't care how secure they are.
I can't sleep knowing

87
00:07:43,245 --> 00:07:46,612
there's a room full of people on this ship
who would kill me first chance they got.

88
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:56,416
- You know, HR was my job on Icarus.
- And psych evals are T.J.'s responsibility.

89
00:07:56,491 --> 00:07:57,787
She's going to need some time.

90
00:07:57,858 --> 00:08:00,588
It's going to be hard enough for her
to fulfill her duties as medic.

91
00:08:00,661 --> 00:08:02,424
Great. Fine. Thanks.

92
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:09,695
The IOA reports our conflict
with the Lucian Alliance

93
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:12,067
in the Milky Way is escalating.

94
00:08:12,272 --> 00:08:14,832
Intel suggests
they may be planning an attack on Earth.

95
00:08:14,908 --> 00:08:17,843
Have you learned anything
from the prisoners?

96
00:08:17,977 --> 00:08:19,444
Not yet.

97
00:08:19,646 --> 00:08:21,273
It would help if I could reassure them

98
00:08:21,347 --> 00:08:23,247
that we're not just going to
pump them for information

99
00:08:23,316 --> 00:08:26,409
- and then dump them on the next planet.
- Really?

100
00:08:26,518 --> 00:08:28,577
Well, they dumped us on a planet to die.

101
00:08:28,654 --> 00:08:31,145
Is everyone on board
willing to starve for them?

102
00:08:31,223 --> 00:08:32,349
We haven't come to that point yet...

103
00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:35,587
How ugly are you willing
to let this get, Camile?

104
00:08:36,495 --> 00:08:38,588
I'm just asking because
I don't think this has anything to do

105
00:08:38,664 --> 00:08:40,130
with the proper treatment of POWs,
and you know it.

106
00:08:40,898 --> 00:08:42,866
They tried to kill us,

107
00:08:42,934 --> 00:08:46,734
and we do not have the capability to hold
onto these prisoners over the long haul.

108
00:08:46,804 --> 00:08:48,738
They're not all dangerous.
If you would just read my report...

109
00:08:48,806 --> 00:08:51,366
"I was just following orders"
is a claim that I've heard before.

110
00:08:51,442 --> 00:08:54,740
People will say anything
to save themselves, Camile.

111
00:08:55,378 --> 00:08:57,778
So we're just going to
leave them on the next viable planet

112
00:08:57,847 --> 00:08:58,871
and then wash our hands of it?

113
00:09:00,617 --> 00:09:02,983
Let's hope we find a viable planet.

114
00:09:07,857 --> 00:09:10,324
You thought this was going to be easier,
didn't you?

115
00:09:10,492 --> 00:09:12,619
You thought all you'd need to do
was turn the key.

116
00:09:12,695 --> 00:09:17,132
This ship, its systems were designed
to be run by an entire crew.

117
00:09:17,533 --> 00:09:18,795
Well, you have a crew.

118
00:09:19,401 --> 00:09:21,926
Yeah, a crew that knows
what they're doing.

119
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,436
This is what you wanted.

120
00:09:25,506 --> 00:09:29,772
<i>You know, the Ancients, they never intended
Destiny to operate on its own.</i>

121
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,683
They were supposed to come here,
in person.

122
00:09:40,587 --> 00:09:43,647
There was a point to this mission.
There had to be.

123
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:47,920
And yet, the first thing you did
was turn the autopilot system back on.

124
00:09:48,795 --> 00:09:51,058
Until I can be sure
I know how to use each function.

125
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:54,896
I wouldn't want to stop accidentally in
range of another binary pulsar, would I?

126
00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:56,634
Good plan.

127
00:09:56,702 --> 00:10:00,035
You see, right now, I'm
trying to understand

128
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,631
<i>why Destiny stops at some planets
and not others.</i>

129
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:05,335
Maybe they're just rest stops.

130
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:09,437
Designed to let people get out,
stretch their legs, smell the roses,

131
00:10:09,514 --> 00:10:12,608
<i>but in the grand scheme of
Destiny's greater mission,</i>

132
00:10:12,684 --> 00:10:13,912
not very important.

133
00:10:13,985 --> 00:10:16,818
Certainly environments can change
significantly through the years,

134
00:10:16,888 --> 00:10:17,946
become dangerous, even.

135
00:10:18,256 --> 00:10:23,090
<i>But that would mean Destiny's got some
kind of real-time subspace link to the gates.</i>

136
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,321
And look, here,
this planet we're approaching,

137
00:10:25,396 --> 00:10:28,194
different classification entirely,
not merely locked out,

138
00:10:28,265 --> 00:10:30,199
but it seems to be non-functional.

139
00:10:30,634 --> 00:10:32,033
So it seems.

140
00:10:33,302 --> 00:10:34,894
So very helpful.

141
00:10:35,004 --> 00:10:39,407
Do you remember the long walks
we used to take in the gardens back home?

142
00:10:40,977 --> 00:10:44,469
Wherever we were, we'd always find
a quiet place to call our own.

143
00:10:44,547 --> 00:10:47,015
That's it. We need food now.

144
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:50,017
This planet we're approaching
should be rich in plant life.

145
00:10:50,085 --> 00:10:54,078
A big red X generally means
"Danger, don't go there," doesn't it?

146
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:02,955
Is this your only purpose,
to question my actions?

147
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:05,792
So, what are you going to do?

148
00:11:06,534 --> 00:11:08,798
Oh, well, I'll take that as a yes, then.

149
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,905
<i>There has to be a reason
the Destiny dropped out.</i>

150
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,643
There is.
- Where have you been?

151
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:29,113
Busy. We're in range of a planet that
looks like it may have food and water.

152
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,712
Riley says there are no gates.

153
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:31,980
Shuttle range.

154
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:35,152
Wow, look at that.

155
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:38,060
<i>Well, how does Destiny have data
on a planet with no gate on it?</i>

156
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,621
Well, there is a gate on it.
It appears to be non-functioning.

157
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:44,134
<i>So Destiny just happened to drop out
close enough for us to use the shuttle?</i>

158
00:11:44,202 --> 00:11:46,329
- That's convenient...
- Well, it's not magic.

159
00:11:47,371 --> 00:11:48,531
As I've been doing all along,

160
00:11:48,606 --> 00:11:52,098
<i>I've been telling Destiny any way
I can how short of resources we are.</i>

161
00:11:52,176 --> 00:11:53,575
Well, we'll send a team.

162
00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:57,370
Okay, I suggest we land close to the gate,

163
00:11:57,448 --> 00:12:00,143
try and determine why it's not working,
maybe even repair it.

164
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,943
Shuttle trip will take just under an hour.

165
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:04,987
Less than seven hours total
is not much time.

166
00:12:05,055 --> 00:12:06,852
However, if we can get
the gate operational,

167
00:12:06,923 --> 00:12:09,721
we'll be able to transport a lot more
food and water than the shuttle.

168
00:12:09,793 --> 00:12:12,091
Two gates cannot dial each other
in this close a proximity.

169
00:12:12,162 --> 00:12:15,562
This planet may well be in range
the next time we drop out of FTL.

170
00:12:15,631 --> 00:12:19,328
If we can get the gate active, we might
be able to dial back down the line.

171
00:12:19,969 --> 00:12:21,231
You want to go?

172
00:12:22,538 --> 00:12:24,836
- No, no, I should stay here.
- Oh, what's more important right now...

173
00:12:24,907 --> 00:12:27,238
Well, there's a number of systems
that's been malfunctioning of late.

174
00:12:27,308 --> 00:12:29,606
I'm working on those, actually.

175
00:12:33,848 --> 00:12:35,475
- Sir.
T.J.

176
00:12:36,351 --> 00:12:39,411
I'm almost ready to go.
Just packing up my kit.

177
00:12:40,754 --> 00:12:42,085
You...

178
00:12:42,956 --> 00:12:44,218
You sure?

179
00:12:44,892 --> 00:12:49,522
Well, I'll admit I'm not 100%,
but we're low on medicinals,

180
00:12:49,596 --> 00:12:52,690
and I know we'll only be there a few hours,
so I should at least take a look around.

181
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,394
I'll take it easy.

182
00:12:54,767 --> 00:12:58,828
Yeah. Yeah, I just... You know,
I wanted to make sure you're okay.

183
00:13:02,775 --> 00:13:05,005
- Good luck down there.
- Thanks.

184
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,213
Dr. Rush has pinpointed
the Stargate's position on the surface,

185
00:13:16,288 --> 00:13:18,313
and I've plotted a course.

186
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,820
Colonel Young, this is Scott.
All systems are go.

187
00:13:21,026 --> 00:13:23,653
<i>- We are ready for take-off.
- Go ahead, Lieutenant.</i>

188
00:13:23,727 --> 00:13:25,319
Roger that.

189
00:13:34,238 --> 00:13:36,570
I'm worried about you, Nicholas.

190
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:41,204
Yeah, so am I. I've got work to do,
and I can't seem to leave myself alone.

191
00:13:41,277 --> 00:13:43,609
You're missing things.

192
00:13:50,186 --> 00:13:51,652
Dr. Franklin.

193
00:13:52,054 --> 00:13:55,854
It's too much for one person.
I don't care how smart you are.

194
00:13:56,658 --> 00:13:59,650
Okay, so tell me. What am I missing?

195
00:14:00,128 --> 00:14:03,529
Well, for one, the data on the planet.

196
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,765
It's extensive. What about it?

197
00:14:05,933 --> 00:14:10,802
You didn't notice the volcanic activity?
The atmospheric super-rotation?

198
00:14:18,713 --> 00:14:20,043
A few minutes away now.

199
00:14:22,782 --> 00:14:24,977
It'll be fine. They'll be fine.

200
00:14:26,353 --> 00:14:29,254
You've based your calculation
on optimal structural integrity.

201
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,858
I based it on the specs in the database.

202
00:14:32,926 --> 00:14:36,088
Which don't account for flaws
that were developed over,

203
00:14:36,161 --> 00:14:38,994
I don't know, say, a million-plus years.

204
00:14:46,438 --> 00:14:48,928
Lieutenant Scott, this is Dr. Rush.
Do you read?

205
00:14:50,842 --> 00:14:52,571
Yeah, I hear you. Go ahead.

206
00:14:53,044 --> 00:14:55,945
You're about to enter an area
of atmospheric super-rotation.

207
00:14:57,515 --> 00:14:59,642
Okay, what does that mean?

208
00:14:59,884 --> 00:15:01,010
Well, I've done some calculations,

209
00:15:01,085 --> 00:15:03,882
and you will experience
some excessive turbulence,

210
00:15:03,954 --> 00:15:06,582
but nothing
the shuttle wasn't built to handle.

211
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:08,887
Okay, thanks for the heads-up.

212
00:15:18,301 --> 00:15:21,236
All right, you heard the man. Hang on.
It could be a little bit bumpy.

213
00:15:33,214 --> 00:15:34,545
Not so bad.

214
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,921
Whoa!

215
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,258
All right, hang on, guys, hang on!

216
00:15:53,701 --> 00:15:55,999
Lieutenant Scott, do you hear me?

217
00:15:57,604 --> 00:16:00,037
Lieutenant Scott, can you hear me?

218
00:16:01,507 --> 00:16:04,237
<i>Yeah. Loud and clear.
We made it.</i>

219
00:16:04,744 --> 00:16:07,406
Glad to hear it.
Check back in once you've landed.

220
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,209
Will do. Scott out.

221
00:16:28,966 --> 00:16:30,524
- Hang on!
- What's going on?

222
00:16:30,701 --> 00:16:32,692
Just lost power!
Half of the systems are down.

223
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,895
Come on, come on...

224
00:16:41,212 --> 00:16:44,146
You've got to give me something.
You've got to give me something. Come on.

225
00:16:44,214 --> 00:16:45,306
- Pull up!
- I can't!

226
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,529
- T. J?
- Yeah?

227
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:20,865
Is anyone hurt?
- Over here.

228
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:25,271
- You okay?
- Yeah.

229
00:18:27,477 --> 00:18:29,104
He's got a pulse.

230
00:18:33,683 --> 00:18:36,048
- Everyone else okay?
- Yup. Yup.

231
00:18:37,252 --> 00:18:39,482
- Dunning, you all right?
- Yeah.

232
00:18:40,055 --> 00:18:42,046
Just relax. It's okay, just relax.

233
00:18:42,124 --> 00:18:45,252
- Relax.
- I can't move.

234
00:18:45,393 --> 00:18:47,987
Okay, don't try.
Now, just tell me where it hurts.

235
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:53,662
It doesn't hurt.
I can't feel my legs at all.

236
00:18:58,572 --> 00:19:01,040
- Where's Rush?
- No idea. I called him.

237
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:04,069
This is Young. Go ahead, Lieutenant.

238
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:06,271
<i>Still not sure
what happened, sir.</i>

239
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:09,777
Like Rush said, it was a pretty rough ride
through the atmosphere.

240
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,010
Whoa, what do you mean, "Like Rush said"?

241
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:13,950
<i>He called to warn us
on the ship's comm,</i>

242
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,352
but it seemed like we made it through fine.

243
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:19,288
Then shortly after, I lost flight control.

244
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:20,851
Injuries?

245
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,351
Riley's legs are pinned for now.

246
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:28,665
T.J.'s working on him.
Everyone else is fine.

247
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,664
Right now we're trying
to get the back door open.

248
00:19:31,736 --> 00:19:35,035
We took a lot of damage, sir.
One of the windows is gone.

249
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:38,942
<i>Bottom line, I don't think we're
going to be flying out of here.</i>

250
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:42,537
<i>- Destiny is going to jump in six hours.
- And we can't stop it.</i>

251
00:19:43,147 --> 00:19:44,478
Lieutenant, this is Rush.

252
00:19:44,815 --> 00:19:46,748
<i>You need to find the gate,
get it operational.</i>

253
00:19:46,816 --> 00:19:49,580
<i>Hopefully, the next time Destiny
drops out, we'll still be in range.</i>

254
00:19:49,686 --> 00:19:52,246
<i>All right, copy that.
I'll check back in 30 minutes.</i>

255
00:20:03,832 --> 00:20:06,596
All right, you have a decent idea
which direction to go to find the gate?

256
00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:10,696
- We'll figure it out.
- Hey, how's Riley?

257
00:20:11,674 --> 00:20:12,971
I don't know.

258
00:20:13,709 --> 00:20:18,202
All right, LT, you take
Eli, Volker and Greer.

259
00:20:18,546 --> 00:20:20,070
Okay, let's go.

260
00:20:32,726 --> 00:20:33,818
He's wedged in there pretty good.

261
00:20:33,894 --> 00:20:35,759
I'm not sure
we should be trying to move him anyway.

262
00:20:35,963 --> 00:20:38,261
We're gonna have to eventually.

263
00:20:41,735 --> 00:20:43,725
I'm sure you're thinking
this probably wouldn't have happened

264
00:20:43,803 --> 00:20:45,600
had we not been so desperate
for food and water.

265
00:20:45,671 --> 00:20:48,868
- That doesn't matter now.
- I reported to the IOA.

266
00:20:48,941 --> 00:20:50,772
- I don't care.
- They insist that you keep

267
00:20:50,843 --> 00:20:52,936
- the prisoners on board... Colonel...
- Camile, I don't care.

268
00:20:53,012 --> 00:20:56,413
<i>We need backup
in the prisoners' hold immediately!</i>

269
00:20:57,515 --> 00:20:59,176
Stand down!
Back up against the wall!

270
00:21:00,619 --> 00:21:01,847
Now!

271
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,348
Hold it right there!
Break it up!

272
00:21:06,491 --> 00:21:07,958
Grab his arm!

273
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,623
Stand down now!

274
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,490
Hey, come on, over here!

275
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,633
Lieutenant! Sergeant!

276
00:21:19,803 --> 00:21:20,963
I got him!

277
00:21:22,139 --> 00:21:24,107
Hold him down!

278
00:21:29,412 --> 00:21:30,640
Everett!

279
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,408
Leave it!

280
00:21:47,195 --> 00:21:50,358
I don't see anything!
I've got no addresses coming up.

281
00:21:50,465 --> 00:21:53,229
- Well, this is where it should be.
You sure?

282
00:21:53,801 --> 00:21:56,599
No, if I was sure, there'd be a gate here.

283
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:04,410
Okay, stop, stop, stop!

284
00:22:06,847 --> 00:22:11,613
Okay, I'm going to try and reach in there
and see if I can feel anything. Okay?

285
00:22:15,388 --> 00:22:16,377
Lift it up.

286
00:22:21,461 --> 00:22:23,792
T.J., we can't hold this...
- Okay!

287
00:22:30,135 --> 00:22:31,693
His leg's stuck pretty good.

288
00:22:32,104 --> 00:22:35,835
I think the pressure's actually helping
cut off circulation to a wound.

289
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:49,486
<i>Okay. Destiny just jumped.
This is not good.</i>

290
00:22:49,854 --> 00:22:51,650
Oh, try not to panic.

291
00:22:51,988 --> 00:22:55,082
Experience tells me
that this is a very good time to panic.

292
00:22:55,158 --> 00:22:57,820
What are the odds it will still be in range
next time it drops out?

293
00:22:57,894 --> 00:22:59,862
It's impossible to know.

294
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,995
Hey!

295
00:23:03,266 --> 00:23:04,630
I found it.

296
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,525
The gate? You can see it from there?

297
00:23:12,608 --> 00:23:14,235
Where? I... I don't see it.

298
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,610
Look down.

299
00:23:40,968 --> 00:23:44,597
You need to sleep
or you're just gonna make more mistakes.

300
00:23:47,673 --> 00:23:51,200
You know, it would be easier
if you would actually help.

301
00:23:52,445 --> 00:23:54,470
What makes you think I can?

302
00:23:56,783 --> 00:23:59,013
- Can I speak to Franklin?
- Who?

303
00:24:01,186 --> 00:24:02,619
One of two things is happening here.

304
00:24:02,687 --> 00:24:06,589
Either I'm losing my mind
or you and Dr. Franklin are somehow

305
00:24:06,658 --> 00:24:09,923
being manifested by the ship
in order to communicate with me.

306
00:24:10,195 --> 00:24:15,064
Now, he tends to be a little bit more
helpful when it comes to technical matters.

307
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,294
Let's see. What are you trying to do?

308
00:24:18,636 --> 00:24:20,763
<i>Figure out how to control
how long Destiny stops</i>

309
00:24:20,838 --> 00:24:21,896
when it drops out of FTL.

310
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,301
Okay, can't help you with that, sorry.

311
00:24:28,312 --> 00:24:30,711
Right. I am losing my mind, then.

312
00:24:37,153 --> 00:24:41,715
<i>There don't seem to be any Stargates coming
up in Destiny's immediate path.</i>

313
00:24:42,459 --> 00:24:44,790
Now, I'll have to stop this ship soon

314
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,522
or we're going to be out of range
of the planet the team's stranded on.

315
00:24:47,596 --> 00:24:48,961
And with no other gates in range,

316
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:51,864
you don't know how to explain
to everyone else why the ship has stopped.

317
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:56,167
Exactly. I can't just keep
dropping in and out of FTL.

318
00:24:57,005 --> 00:24:59,837
I'm going to
damage the drives permanently.

319
00:25:00,074 --> 00:25:03,009
They have to run for a minimum of
four hours each time they're activated,

320
00:25:03,077 --> 00:25:08,208
which means, next time I drop out,
I've got one last shot at this.

321
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:13,050
Why don't you just tell the truth?
Ask for help?

322
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:15,087
No... No, I can't.

323
00:25:15,155 --> 00:25:16,520
Because Colonel Young can't be trusted?

324
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:19,115
He let the Lucian Alliance
take over this ship.

325
00:25:19,192 --> 00:25:20,489
The man is mentally unstable.

326
00:25:21,428 --> 00:25:23,487
And he's getting worse all the time.
He nearly just killed a man.

327
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,997
Your negligence caused
the shuttle to crash.

328
00:25:26,065 --> 00:25:28,033
The situation is desperate because of him.

329
00:25:29,635 --> 00:25:32,069
He's not fit to lead this mission.

330
00:25:48,086 --> 00:25:50,281
- Hey.
- How's Riley?

331
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:55,688
He's stuck pretty good.
He's... He's losing a lot of blood.

332
00:25:56,593 --> 00:25:57,719
There's no way to get him free?

333
00:25:58,695 --> 00:26:02,893
T.J. thinks the pressure from the wreckage
is what's keeping him from bleeding out.

334
00:26:08,938 --> 00:26:10,997
There's got to be something we can do.

335
00:26:11,974 --> 00:26:13,771
Let's get this gate uncovered.

336
00:26:25,687 --> 00:26:28,053
Are you in any pain?
I'm okay.

337
00:26:28,723 --> 00:26:31,419
You ever been in this situation before?

338
00:26:32,594 --> 00:26:35,654
Stuck on an alien planet
after a shuttle crash?

339
00:26:35,964 --> 00:26:38,193
No, this one's a first for me.

340
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:43,501
I meant having to tend to someone
that you knew was gonna die.

341
00:26:47,007 --> 00:26:49,237
Yeah. I have.

342
00:26:50,477 --> 00:26:56,608
Sounds crazy, but I came so close lately
with the explosion and then getting shot.

343
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,241
I kind of figured
that maybe it just wasn't my time.

344
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:10,918
I'm not all that spiritual,
but my mother's pretty religious.

345
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:13,025
Anglican.

346
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,226
She'd be praying for me right now
if she knew.

347
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:20,569
My dad, he always said it was stupid,

348
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:24,100
but he always went to church with her.

349
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,738
I won't leave you if it...

350
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:31,640
If it comes to it.

351
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:38,152
Do you believe in anything?
God? The afterlife?

352
00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:40,756
I don't know.

353
00:27:42,892 --> 00:27:47,022
Since we've been here,
we've seen some incredible things.

354
00:27:47,397 --> 00:27:50,559
We know that there's so much
we don't understand,

355
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,434
beings more powerful than us.

356
00:27:58,474 --> 00:28:03,206
Can I tell you something
that I haven't told anyone?

357
00:28:04,145 --> 00:28:06,670
Sure. Who am I going to tell, right?

358
00:28:12,253 --> 00:28:16,712
Remember that planet that we stopped at
that we thought was created by aliens?

359
00:28:17,724 --> 00:28:18,816
Yeah.

360
00:28:21,094 --> 00:28:24,188
I know this sounds crazy,
but I went back there.

361
00:28:25,632 --> 00:28:28,692
I don't know if it was a dream,
a vision maybe.

362
00:28:31,537 --> 00:28:33,129
They said that they came and got me.

363
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:38,470
They have my baby,

364
00:28:39,979 --> 00:28:41,776
and she's safe there.

365
00:28:42,581 --> 00:28:44,208
Do you believe that?

366
00:28:46,885 --> 00:28:52,118
It felt real.
And I don't know how to explain it.

367
00:28:55,126 --> 00:28:59,994
I want it to be possible.
It's just that little... Little bit of hope.

368
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,367
It makes things bearable, so...

369
00:29:05,736 --> 00:29:07,363
So I let it live.

370
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,217
I want to apologize
for my people's behavior.

371
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:32,192
Next viable planet we stop at,
you're all going to be left there.

372
00:29:33,195 --> 00:29:34,924
I expect co-operation until such time

373
00:29:34,996 --> 00:29:38,295
or appropriate force will be used
to maintain order.

374
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:52,478
You know, I think I remember
reading somewhere

375
00:29:52,546 --> 00:29:55,344
that a big enough explosion
close enough to a Stargate

376
00:29:55,515 --> 00:29:59,007
can detonate the super-conductive material
that it's made of.

377
00:29:59,219 --> 00:30:02,484
The resulting explosion
can take a chunk out of a planet.

378
00:30:02,555 --> 00:30:04,580
Well, it's not going to...

379
00:30:04,824 --> 00:30:06,348
It's not gonna be that big.

380
00:30:07,227 --> 00:30:08,251
You're sure?

381
00:30:09,195 --> 00:30:14,359
I... We don't have much of a choice, do we?
It could take weeks to dig this thing out.

382
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,492
Hopefully, the blast won't damage the gate.

383
00:30:18,137 --> 00:30:19,365
Do you want me to flip the switch or not?

384
00:30:20,305 --> 00:30:22,136
- Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, sure...
- I'm flipping the switch.

385
00:30:22,207 --> 00:30:23,969
No, flip it already.

386
00:30:26,377 --> 00:30:28,004
Fire in the hole!

387
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,959
That was pretty big.

388
00:30:53,335 --> 00:30:55,667
I used the communication stones.

389
00:30:56,071 --> 00:30:59,529
Okay. We'll just skip over the fact
that I didn't authorize that.

390
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,371
I have a short list.

391
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:04,435
Based on intel provided
by both myself and Camile Wray.

392
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,273
You're being ordered to keep a select
number of Lucian Alliance onboard

393
00:31:07,348 --> 00:31:08,940
who may prove valuable.

394
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,980
And if I don't,
I assume you're going to tell me

395
00:31:12,053 --> 00:31:14,453
that you've been ordered
to relieve me of my command.

396
00:31:15,757 --> 00:31:18,317
You think you've earned the trust of
the men and women on this ship enough

397
00:31:18,393 --> 00:31:19,451
for them to follow you?

398
00:31:24,264 --> 00:31:27,199
Military personnel are still
in the service of Stargate Command

399
00:31:27,267 --> 00:31:28,894
and expected to follow orders.

400
00:31:36,609 --> 00:31:39,237
Rush, this is Young. Where are you?

401
00:31:42,682 --> 00:31:44,343
It's less than three hours.

402
00:31:44,417 --> 00:31:47,147
The address to the planet came up,
but it's still locked out.

403
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,517
The strange thing is that
there are no other planets in range.

404
00:31:49,588 --> 00:31:51,715
- Nothing.
- Why'd we drop out?

405
00:31:52,057 --> 00:31:55,049
- Exactly. It doesn't make sense.
- Suggestions?

406
00:31:56,027 --> 00:31:58,962
Try to bypass the lock-out. Dial anyway.

407
00:31:59,798 --> 00:32:01,425
It's a long shot.

408
00:32:02,434 --> 00:32:06,301
It's all we got.
Rush, we're headed to the Gate Room.

409
00:32:11,642 --> 00:32:14,236
- Where have you been?
- Engine Control Room.

410
00:32:14,311 --> 00:32:15,471
Doing what?

411
00:32:15,546 --> 00:32:19,447
Well, the FTL drive's still suffering
some effects from the pulsar radiation,

412
00:32:19,515 --> 00:32:21,210
stopping at shorter intervals now,

413
00:32:21,284 --> 00:32:25,015
but regardless of whether
we're in range of a planet or not.

414
00:32:44,273 --> 00:32:45,762
You feel that?

415
00:32:49,877 --> 00:32:52,641
Hey, science guys, this thing is shaking.

416
00:32:52,847 --> 00:32:54,940
- Someone's trying to dial in.
- Oh, clear the event horizon.

417
00:32:58,953 --> 00:33:02,388
<i>- The address is here. We've got Destiny!
- Shaking's stopped.</i>

418
00:33:02,455 --> 00:33:05,982
Everyone, back away.
I'm going to try to dial them.

419
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:14,196
It's working. It's working!

420
00:33:17,603 --> 00:33:19,833
<i>Destiny, this is Scott.
Permission to come aboard.</i>

421
00:33:19,905 --> 00:33:20,929
Permission granted.

422
00:33:25,945 --> 00:33:29,243
Glad to see you guys are okay.
Where are the others?

423
00:33:33,818 --> 00:33:35,843
Riley's not going to make it, sir.

424
00:33:43,994 --> 00:33:45,052
Sir.

425
00:34:06,415 --> 00:34:08,576
Sir, I'm not just gonna let him die alone.

426
00:34:08,651 --> 00:34:10,641
Can you give me a minute?

427
00:34:11,486 --> 00:34:12,976
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

428
00:34:27,267 --> 00:34:28,461
Sorry, sir.

429
00:34:29,903 --> 00:34:34,738
You are a fine soldier, a good man.
None of this is your fault.

430
00:34:35,275 --> 00:34:36,333
You know that.

431
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:39,378
Don't stay on my account.
Just make them leave.

432
00:34:39,779 --> 00:34:42,213
I don't want anyone to
risk being stuck here.

433
00:34:48,254 --> 00:34:50,518
I'm not going to be around
that much longer.

434
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:53,383
What can I tell your family?

435
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:58,761
Nothing really seems like enough.

436
00:35:33,096 --> 00:35:34,495
How long do you think he'll last?

437
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,367
I don't know.

438
00:35:44,006 --> 00:35:45,735
<i>How much time until Destiny jumps?</i>

439
00:35:46,742 --> 00:35:51,075
No, we're good. We're fine.
I don't want you to worry, okay?

440
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,980
I'd ask for your gun,
but I don't want them to blame you.

441
00:36:00,321 --> 00:36:01,481
Sir...

442
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:04,979
Please.

443
00:36:08,695 --> 00:36:10,094
I'm in pain.

444
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,459
I'll get T.J.

445
00:36:19,105 --> 00:36:20,129
No.

446
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,864
No!

447
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,404
Please.

448
00:38:28,992 --> 00:38:30,323
He's gone.

449
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:59,516
<i>You know, you'd figure
being stranded on this ship</i>

450
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:03,318
<i>in the middle of nowhere with a bunch
of strangers would be the problem,</i>

451
00:39:03,391 --> 00:39:07,555
<i>but that isn't it exactly.</i>

452
00:39:08,062 --> 00:39:09,187
To Riley.

453
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:14,257
<i>It's not, it's not so much
being out here as it is not being there.</i>

454
00:39:16,403 --> 00:39:21,602
<i>For the birthdays,
the weddings, the funerals...</i>

455
00:39:24,744 --> 00:39:29,010
<i>Simple things like just taking your
nephew to school on his first day,</i>

456
00:39:30,449 --> 00:39:33,509
<i>or even taking the dog for a walk.</i>

457
00:39:35,187 --> 00:39:36,381
<i>You now, just not...</i>

458
00:39:39,658 --> 00:39:41,250
<i>Not being there.</i>

459
00:40:03,981 --> 00:40:05,811
There was nothing
that could be done for Riley.

460
00:40:08,217 --> 00:40:10,913
<i>Stalling Destiny any longer
wouldn't have helped him.</i>

461
00:40:13,189 --> 00:40:14,383
I know.

462
00:40:14,857 --> 00:40:17,052
Well, you think I don't know?

463
00:40:18,328 --> 00:40:21,057
All of this is my fault.

464
00:40:22,764 --> 00:40:26,632
I was trying to save lives,
all of our lives, not just my own.

465
00:40:29,938 --> 00:40:33,135
This database just confirms
what I knew all along.

466
00:40:35,009 --> 00:40:39,446
<i>This ship was named
Destiny for a reason.</i>

467
00:41:35,866 --> 00:41:37,458
It must be like Rush said,

468
00:41:37,534 --> 00:41:39,229
another short jump
because of the radiation effect.

469
00:41:40,437 --> 00:41:41,768
Something just came up on sensors.

470
00:41:43,407 --> 00:41:46,398
<i>This is Rush.
Meet me in the observation deck.</i>

471
00:41:48,644 --> 00:41:50,669
I heard the radio chatter.

472
00:41:53,115 --> 00:41:55,015
What's going on?

473
00:41:55,518 --> 00:41:58,816
There's an object out there.
It's just coming into range.

474
00:41:58,887 --> 00:42:00,218
Well, what is it?

475
00:42:00,288 --> 00:42:03,587
We're not sure,
but we're about to find out.

476
00:42:05,427 --> 00:42:07,622
We're headed straight for it.

477
00:43:29,171 --> 00:43:30,160
English - US - SDH
