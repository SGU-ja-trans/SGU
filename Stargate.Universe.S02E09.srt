1
00:00:02,027 --> 00:00:04,962
<i>This is what Destiny intended from
the moment it entered the star system.</i>

2
00:00:05,364 --> 00:00:08,596
<i>That ship is the best chance
we have of getting home.</i>

3
00:00:08,935 --> 00:00:11,164
- Are we done?
- We'll never be done.

4
00:00:12,338 --> 00:00:13,703
<i>You shouldn't have
left him on the planet.</i>

5
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:15,373
<i>You think I don't know that?</i>

6
00:00:15,908 --> 00:00:19,345
<i>Everyone thinks we're safe.
They think that they'll never find us again.</i>

7
00:00:19,479 --> 00:00:21,378
Why did you take
one of our people prisoner?

8
00:00:22,983 --> 00:00:24,450
<i>We're not safe, are we?</i>

9
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:26,509
They're coming!
- Who's coming?

10
00:00:26,586 --> 00:00:28,144
<i>Lucian Alliance,
they're coming to take Destiny.</i>

11
00:00:28,389 --> 00:00:30,049
<i>There's only one way
this is going to end if we wait.</i>

12
00:00:30,158 --> 00:00:31,556
<i>I'm not
surrendering this ship.</i>

13
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:34,327
<i>They actually
built this planet?</i>

14
00:00:34,394 --> 00:00:37,693
<i>That would make them the number-one
all-time advanced civilization.</i>

15
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:39,265
Some of the people have decided

16
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,267
that they would like to
stay behind on the planet.

17
00:00:41,335 --> 00:00:43,963
<i>Whoever created this planet
will provide for us.</i>

18
00:00:44,038 --> 00:00:46,097
<i>They are our best chance
of getting back home.</i>

19
00:00:46,307 --> 00:00:48,901
I am leaving
the damaged shuttle behind.

20
00:00:49,043 --> 00:00:50,874
You can use it for shelter and power.

21
00:00:50,945 --> 00:00:53,345
All military personnel will return with me.

22
00:00:53,682 --> 00:00:54,943
My skin's changing.

23
00:00:55,016 --> 00:00:57,008
It's coarse. And it's growing.

24
00:00:57,285 --> 00:00:58,809
<i>Our baby is still alive.</i>

25
00:00:59,154 --> 00:01:02,020
Just because you want something to be true
it doesn't mean it is, T.J.

26
00:01:08,163 --> 00:01:10,222
Hmm, not much to look at,
is it?

27
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:14,261
Well... Well, it depends what you see.

28
00:01:14,403 --> 00:01:17,930
I see a sign of intelligence that cannot
possibly have been there

29
00:01:18,007 --> 00:01:21,373
by any current description of the universe,
and yet, there it is.

30
00:01:23,345 --> 00:01:25,905
I see the greatest mystery of all time.

31
00:01:27,183 --> 00:01:28,240
Really?

32
00:01:28,417 --> 00:01:30,817
Look, if you can't fix that thing,
I don't know what we're doin' here.

33
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,217
Keep your pants on.

34
00:01:34,324 --> 00:01:36,315
Okay, I got it this time.

35
00:01:40,997 --> 00:01:43,591
- What?
- Nothing. Cheers.

36
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:52,040
Brody, looks like we just came out of FTL.
What's going on?

37
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,207
<i>This is Volker.</i>

38
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,979
Brody had to fix the still,
so we switched shifts.

39
00:01:57,046 --> 00:01:58,035
I know you hate that.

40
00:01:58,214 --> 00:01:59,341
I don't care. Speak.

41
00:01:59,617 --> 00:02:02,051
<i>Okay, well, we've got a couple of
gate addresses popping up.</i>

42
00:02:02,586 --> 00:02:04,451
<i>Holy cow, do you see that?</i>

43
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:08,656
Yeah, I do.

44
00:02:13,465 --> 00:02:14,522
It looks like our shuttle.

45
00:02:14,899 --> 00:02:16,264
<i>Yes, it does.</i>

46
00:02:17,235 --> 00:02:19,794
Rush, this is Young.
Meet me on the bridge. Now.

47
00:02:26,478 --> 00:02:27,706
What's it doing?

48
00:02:28,113 --> 00:02:30,673
Nothing. It's just matching
our velocity off the right side.

49
00:02:31,449 --> 00:02:32,643
Where did that thing come from?

50
00:02:32,751 --> 00:02:35,481
I don't know. One minute it wasn't there,
the next minute it was.

51
00:02:35,553 --> 00:02:36,646
What's happened?

52
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:38,515
It just came out of nowhere.

53
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:41,519
Is that the shuttle?

54
00:02:41,727 --> 00:02:43,523
Yeah, seems like it.

55
00:02:46,732 --> 00:02:49,360
No, I wasn't drinking, I was fixing it.

56
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:56,073
<i>Hello?
Can anyone hear me? Hello?</i>

57
00:02:56,542 --> 00:02:57,839
That sounds like Caine.

58
00:02:58,477 --> 00:02:59,536
Caine's more monotone than that.

59
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:00,910
He's also in another galaxy.

60
00:03:01,013 --> 00:03:02,571
<i>Hello? This is Robert Caine.</i>

61
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,111
<i>We can see the Destiny.
What should we do?</i>

62
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:08,345
How?

63
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:16,053
This is Colonel Young. As far as we know,

64
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:20,896
Dr. Caine and a number of other people are
on a planet thousands of light years away.

65
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:24,663
<i>And as far as we remember, Colonel
, that was where we still were</i>

66
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,239
<i>when we went to sleep last night.</i>

67
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:30,500
Look, the shuttle we left you wasn't
capable of leaving the atmosphere,

68
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,169
let alone fly between galaxies.

69
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,914
<i>We understand that, Dr. Rush,
but here we are.</i>

70
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:37,614
The others are with you?

71
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:39,744
<i>Yes, all of us.</i>

72
00:03:39,921 --> 00:03:42,651
Which brings me back to "how?"

73
00:03:44,726 --> 00:03:48,185
Honestly? I have no idea.

74
00:04:06,882 --> 00:04:09,181
<i>- Lieutenant Scott, report to the bridge.
- Yes, sir.</i>

75
00:04:09,386 --> 00:04:12,252
How could they have known when or where
we were going to come out of FTL?

76
00:04:12,322 --> 00:04:16,087
Or for that matter, drop them
right beside us? This is impossible.

77
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,157
- There they are.
- If it's them.

78
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,792
That's a fair question.

79
00:04:19,995 --> 00:04:22,624
Do you think that we could electronically
compare the voice we are getting

80
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:24,394
from the shuttle to an old Kino recording
of Caine?

81
00:04:24,501 --> 00:04:27,493
Okay, trust me, these aliens built
a planet from scratch

82
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,435
and can just throw a shuttle
between galaxies.

83
00:04:29,506 --> 00:04:32,100
I'm pretty sure they could impersonate
Caine if they wanted to.

84
00:04:32,642 --> 00:04:33,905
Boone used to do a pretty good Caine.

85
00:04:34,078 --> 00:04:35,169
I thought it was the other way around.

86
00:04:35,246 --> 00:04:37,043
So, what, we take them for their word?

87
00:04:37,113 --> 00:04:39,309
They are who they say they are,
and ignore the possibility

88
00:04:39,383 --> 00:04:41,681
that this could be a ruse
to get by our defenses?

89
00:04:42,053 --> 00:04:43,178
Like a Trojan horse?

90
00:04:43,287 --> 00:04:47,223
Well, the truth is, with aliens that can
do this, defenses are meaningless.

91
00:04:47,391 --> 00:04:49,154
Wouldn't mind having
a working shuttle again.

92
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:55,694
There is that. I suggest we invite them
on board and take every precaution.

93
00:04:58,536 --> 00:05:02,597
Sorry for the delay, Dr. Caine. I've asked
Lieutenant Scott to come and help

94
00:05:02,674 --> 00:05:04,471
talk you through the docking procedure.

95
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,199
<i>I don't even drive a car.</i>

96
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,206
Just what a Trojan would say.

97
00:05:08,446 --> 00:05:09,709
The guys in the horse were Greek.

98
00:05:09,781 --> 00:05:11,908
- Well, why is it "Trojan" horse, then?
- Because that's what...

99
00:05:11,983 --> 00:05:12,972
They're from Troy.

100
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:14,382
Are you guys done?

101
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:16,680
Don't worry, Dr. Caine,
we'll take it nice and slow.

102
00:05:23,762 --> 00:05:25,753
This is Greer. Ready and standing by.

103
00:05:26,498 --> 00:05:27,658
I am on my way.

104
00:05:27,732 --> 00:05:29,291
Is it them? I just ran into Eli.

105
00:05:29,468 --> 00:05:31,595
Well, Eli's got a big mouth.
You don't need to be here.

106
00:05:31,671 --> 00:05:33,298
- Try and stop me.
- Listen to me, T.J.,

107
00:05:33,371 --> 00:05:34,805
- I know what you must be thinking...
- You should have told me...

108
00:05:34,874 --> 00:05:36,739
What you experienced was a simulation,
we know that.

109
00:05:36,809 --> 00:05:37,969
No, you know that.

110
00:05:39,312 --> 00:05:42,179
Look, I'm just saying,
if they can send our people back to us,

111
00:05:42,248 --> 00:05:43,875
don't you think it's possible
they could save our daughter?

112
00:05:44,317 --> 00:05:45,614
Nobody mentioned a child.

113
00:05:46,352 --> 00:05:47,980
I don't want you to set yourself up.

114
00:05:48,822 --> 00:05:50,119
I need to know.

115
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,823
<i>All right, Dr.
Caine, what we want now</i>

116
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:02,535
is one short burst from
the forward maneuvering thrusters

117
00:06:02,603 --> 00:06:05,367
just to set her down, and we are home.

118
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,531
Just a kiss, now.

119
00:06:09,276 --> 00:06:12,370
All right, good. Good job. You got it.

120
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:14,911
I can lock you down from here.
Stand by for egress.

121
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,310
<i>Docking clamps in place, sir.</i>

122
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:21,816
Thank you, Lieutenant.

123
00:06:36,337 --> 00:06:37,326
Hi.

124
00:06:38,673 --> 00:06:39,936
Colonel Young.

125
00:06:40,642 --> 00:06:42,907
This must be just as much
a surprise to you.

126
00:06:43,212 --> 00:06:44,304
You have no idea.

127
00:06:45,381 --> 00:06:47,747
You will exit the shuttle
one person at a time.

128
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,881
Sergeant Greer and members of his team
will escort you to a holding area.

129
00:06:52,054 --> 00:06:55,649
Move quickly, talk to no one,
touch nothing.

130
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:59,652
I don't understand. You know us.
We're not a threat.

131
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:02,157
And I'm glad to hear that. Sergeant.

132
00:07:02,332 --> 00:07:04,493
After you. Sir.

133
00:07:10,106 --> 00:07:11,903
One at a time, please.

134
00:07:20,952 --> 00:07:22,179
Peter!

135
00:07:23,521 --> 00:07:24,748
Val!

136
00:07:46,577 --> 00:07:47,908
You all right?

137
00:07:49,214 --> 00:07:50,511
I'm fine.

138
00:08:03,161 --> 00:08:04,594
I'm losing Chloe.

139
00:08:09,134 --> 00:08:15,074
I mean, she's losing herself,
and we can't stop it.

140
00:08:20,146 --> 00:08:21,477
- Hi.
- Hey.

141
00:08:22,115 --> 00:08:23,377
Did you hear the news?

142
00:08:24,317 --> 00:08:28,811
Dr. Caine and the bunch that stayed back
on that planet, they came back.

143
00:08:29,922 --> 00:08:31,583
- How?
- Hell if I know.

144
00:08:31,658 --> 00:08:35,424
They don't even know.
I guess we'll find out.

145
00:08:37,965 --> 00:08:40,729
We've got a shuttle again, though,
so you gotta like that.

146
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:45,636
Can I get you anything?

147
00:08:45,773 --> 00:08:47,103
- No.
- Okay.

148
00:08:51,011 --> 00:08:52,603
You're trying so hard,

149
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:56,341
but every time I look at your face,
you can't hide it.

150
00:08:57,551 --> 00:08:58,610
What?

151
00:08:58,752 --> 00:09:03,315
That you're not looking at me anymore,
at least not as the person I used to be.

152
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,915
- You see the other.
- Chloe...

153
00:09:05,026 --> 00:09:10,987
No, it's just your
inability to lie, Matthew.

154
00:09:12,734 --> 00:09:17,728
It's one of the best things about you,
but I know what you see.

155
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:20,239
I see it, too.

156
00:09:24,113 --> 00:09:26,171
This is new this morning.

157
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:29,508
We're gonna fix this.

158
00:09:29,585 --> 00:09:32,018
- I don't even know if I want you to.
- Yeah, you do.

159
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:33,680
I'm hardly blacking out anymore.

160
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:38,957
The new part of me is just there,
in the foreground.

161
00:09:40,229 --> 00:09:41,662
I'm not afraid of it anymore.

162
00:09:41,797 --> 00:09:42,958
You have to fight it.

163
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,528
I think we're past that.

164
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:52,103
<i>So that's the last thing you
remember, going to sleep in the shuttle?</i>

165
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:57,237
And that it was cold, it was winter.
We were using it as a shelter.

166
00:09:57,748 --> 00:09:59,807
<i>I remember closing my eyes,</i>

167
00:09:59,883 --> 00:10:04,752
<i>and then we were delivered here
by a greater power.</i>

168
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,319
The aliens who created the planet,
you mean.

169
00:10:08,725 --> 00:10:10,124
<i>Or by Providence.</i>

170
00:10:10,595 --> 00:10:12,653
Are you suggesting that God did this?

171
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,289
<i>Is that you, Camile?</i>

172
00:10:14,965 --> 00:10:15,989
Yes.

173
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,890
<i>It's nice to hear your voice.</i>

174
00:10:18,603 --> 00:10:21,970
<i>Well, of course there's no way
of knowing His will,</i>

175
00:10:22,106 --> 00:10:26,600
<i>but I do know that I prayed every
night before I went to sleep</i>

176
00:10:26,677 --> 00:10:27,974
<i>that He would keep us safe.</i>

177
00:10:28,112 --> 00:10:29,670
So, magic then.

178
00:10:29,914 --> 00:10:34,749
<i>You have to admit that our arrival here
is nothing less than miraculous, Eli.</i>

179
00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:38,550
"Any sufficiently advanced technology
is indistinguishable from magic,"

180
00:10:38,624 --> 00:10:39,613
Arthur C. Clarke.

181
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:42,022
"Turn the mic back on." Winston Churchill.

182
00:10:42,861 --> 00:10:43,986
Really?

183
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,697
<i>- Are you going to keep us here?
- We haven't done anything.</i>

184
00:10:48,934 --> 00:10:49,958
Try to be patient.

185
00:10:50,034 --> 00:10:51,400
You'll be released
once you've all undergone

186
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,461
a physical examination one at a time.

187
00:10:54,973 --> 00:10:56,669
<i>But we're perfectly fine.</i>

188
00:10:56,742 --> 00:10:59,108
Well, forgive me if I don't take
your word for that.

189
00:10:59,212 --> 00:11:01,839
The more answers we have,
the less precautions we'll have to take.

190
00:11:02,448 --> 00:11:03,746
Let's keep an eye on them.

191
00:11:09,022 --> 00:11:10,148
What do you think?

192
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,884
Well, it appears to have been
completely restored.

193
00:11:13,993 --> 00:11:15,518
Brand spankin' new, more like it.

194
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:17,559
Every part, every system,

195
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,894
every square inch of this thing is
in perfect factory condition.

196
00:11:20,033 --> 00:11:21,694
Even has that new shuttle smell.

197
00:11:22,702 --> 00:11:23,897
Again, how?

198
00:11:25,105 --> 00:11:27,972
Well, I don't know,
but it could be invaluable to the mission.

199
00:11:28,107 --> 00:11:29,665
So, nothing to be concerned about?

200
00:11:29,743 --> 00:11:32,006
No ticking time bombs?
Alien transmissions?

201
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,104
No, sir. At least not yet, anyway.

202
00:11:34,948 --> 00:11:36,211
Let's keep looking.

203
00:11:39,386 --> 00:11:43,153
They're all in perfect health.
No trace of disease or malnutrition.

204
00:11:43,224 --> 00:11:44,987
Just like the day we left them.

205
00:11:45,226 --> 00:11:46,318
What are the odds of that?

206
00:11:46,427 --> 00:11:48,453
Eight adults who've been through
what they've been through?

207
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,793
You know, not one of them remembers
a damn thing about the planet,

208
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,924
or how they got here.

209
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,368
Well, Caine believes that's God's way
of telling them they've been reborn.

210
00:11:56,571 --> 00:11:59,404
Was that before or after
He gave them amnesia?

211
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,340
The others think that maybe
the aliens discovered them

212
00:12:03,411 --> 00:12:05,345
and returned them to us as
an act of benevolence.

213
00:12:05,515 --> 00:12:06,880
Well, that's nice.

214
00:12:07,516 --> 00:12:10,179
- You're not buying it?
- No, these aliens are too damn powerful.

215
00:12:10,318 --> 00:12:13,152
I mean, building planets,
rebuilding shuttles? They could...

216
00:12:13,221 --> 00:12:15,189
They could squash us like ants
if they wanted to.

217
00:12:16,826 --> 00:12:18,292
- That scares you?
- Yes.

218
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:21,452
But what scares me even more is the
feeling I got when I looked him in the eye.

219
00:12:21,531 --> 00:12:22,520
I thought it was just me.

220
00:12:22,597 --> 00:12:24,065
I should be welcoming them
with open arms,

221
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:27,660
but I can't be in a room with any of them
for more than a minute

222
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,238
before I want to get the hell away.

223
00:12:29,338 --> 00:12:31,967
- Why?
- I don't know, but I want to find out.

224
00:12:34,677 --> 00:12:35,803
Go ahead.

225
00:12:37,146 --> 00:12:39,273
Okay. Um...

226
00:12:41,585 --> 00:12:47,581
I don't know how much longer I'm going
to be me. It's kind of hard to explain...

227
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:50,125
You don't have to.
Everybody understands.

228
00:12:51,028 --> 00:12:53,258
- So I should just do this?
Yeah.

229
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,623
Who should I start with?

230
00:12:56,701 --> 00:12:59,602
Somebody easy. I'm right here.
Start with me.

231
00:13:01,205 --> 00:13:02,194
Okay.

232
00:13:07,178 --> 00:13:11,740
Eli, you've been the most...

233
00:13:14,786 --> 00:13:18,347
Wait, what do you mean
start with someone easy?

234
00:13:18,457 --> 00:13:20,890
You're the hardest to say goodbye to
out of everyone!

235
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,396
Okay, okay, pick somebody else. Chloe?

236
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:28,754
Chloe!

237
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,932
You can all return
to your original quarters.

238
00:13:34,005 --> 00:13:37,737
You will be given a list of duties to help
carry your weight as members of this crew.

239
00:13:38,077 --> 00:13:40,204
Is this as close as we're going to get to
"welcome aboard"?

240
00:13:40,346 --> 00:13:43,942
Yeah, it is. Right now I don't have
any reason to treat you like prisoners.

241
00:13:44,683 --> 00:13:46,548
- Thank you.
- Don't give me a reason.

242
00:14:14,047 --> 00:14:15,981
Hey.

243
00:14:17,685 --> 00:14:20,381
Young finally let us out.

244
00:14:20,588 --> 00:14:23,955
Yeah, that's good.
I've got a shift in hydroponics.

245
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,486
What's wrong?

246
00:14:28,362 --> 00:14:29,693
Don't touch me.

247
00:14:33,134 --> 00:14:34,465
What was that all about?

248
00:14:35,436 --> 00:14:38,098
I see you haven't spent time
with the new arrivals.

249
00:14:39,273 --> 00:14:40,366
No.

250
00:14:40,908 --> 00:14:44,571
Eight science types,
no survival skills.

251
00:14:45,447 --> 00:14:48,007
I've seen a lot of people go in my time

252
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,779
and I know I'm going to see more
before I'm done here.

253
00:14:52,587 --> 00:14:57,786
I have never seen anyone come back.
Until now.

254
00:14:59,429 --> 00:15:01,420
Okay, you're being too deep again.

255
00:15:10,907 --> 00:15:11,999
Hi.

256
00:15:14,243 --> 00:15:16,074
Hey. Good morning.

257
00:15:16,746 --> 00:15:20,842
We were just remarking at how different
the food tastes here than on Eden.

258
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,409
That's what we called the planet.

259
00:15:25,421 --> 00:15:27,946
- I hope you stayed away from the apples.
- Right.

260
00:15:28,225 --> 00:15:31,057
We're actually growing more and more
of our own food.

261
00:15:31,294 --> 00:15:35,391
- If you like, I could show you.
- Yeah.

262
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:39,997
Incredible.

263
00:15:40,504 --> 00:15:41,698
It's a start.

264
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:43,537
Soon it'll be a garden.

265
00:15:44,408 --> 00:15:48,401
I wanted to talk to you about something.
I... I have a memory.

266
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,372
Well, lucky you.

267
00:15:51,783 --> 00:15:58,245
A vivid memory that I visited you
on the planet with my daughter.

268
00:16:00,825 --> 00:16:01,849
Your daughter?

269
00:16:02,427 --> 00:16:05,260
When we first arrived at the planet,
I was pregnant, remember?

270
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,224
I do remember.

271
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:11,329
It was winter,
and you were living in cabins.

272
00:16:11,436 --> 00:16:14,929
You told me that they were provided
by the aliens who created the planet.

273
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:16,364
I told you?

274
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:22,638
And that my daughter was safe,
and you would take care of her.

275
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:30,684
I don't remember anything like that,
Tamara. I'm sorry.

276
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:32,955
I wish I did.

277
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,619
It was so real.

278
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,199
How about the day before that?

279
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:48,297
Let's say in the morning when you
woke up. Was it raining, snowing?

280
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,569
I don't know.

281
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:54,375
Doesn't it bother you that
you don't remember anything

282
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:57,416
but the most generic things from
your experience on that planet?

283
00:16:57,885 --> 00:17:00,853
Just gathering food and fuel?

284
00:17:01,556 --> 00:17:03,045
Maybe that's all we did.

285
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:08,361
Oh, come on, Peter.
You have to remember more than that.

286
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:11,093
You were there for months.

287
00:17:15,203 --> 00:17:18,900
I could show you some of the others, but
the conversation is more or less the same.

288
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,736
So you think their memories
have been tampered with?

289
00:17:22,411 --> 00:17:26,871
I guess it could be a side effect of
whatever mechanism transported them here,

290
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:30,143
but I'm starting to think that maybe

291
00:17:30,219 --> 00:17:32,983
the aliens didn't want our people
to remember something.

292
00:17:33,455 --> 00:17:36,185
The whole thing to me feels like
a damn science experiment.

293
00:17:37,426 --> 00:17:39,086
They're still our people.

294
00:17:39,461 --> 00:17:42,089
They don't creep you out? Even a little?

295
00:17:42,431 --> 00:17:46,629
Well, a lot of people creep me out a
little, so I'm not the best person to ask.

296
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,364
- Really?
- A little.

297
00:17:50,906 --> 00:17:52,066
Me?

298
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,309
Not as much now.

299
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,676
Hmm, that's good. Progress.

300
00:17:57,713 --> 00:18:00,182
Well, keep at it.
They've got to remember something.

301
00:18:07,757 --> 00:18:09,453
- Oh, hey, brother.
- Hi.

302
00:18:09,726 --> 00:18:12,251
- Off duty?
- Yeah, long day.

303
00:18:13,062 --> 00:18:14,256
Long day.

304
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:19,800
- You... You gonna go see Chloe?
- Yeah.

305
00:18:21,338 --> 00:18:23,067
- Yeah.
- Okay.

306
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:26,873
What's wrong with that?

307
00:18:28,178 --> 00:18:29,907
I'm not stoppin' you.

308
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:33,574
Go.

309
00:18:35,085 --> 00:18:40,046
All right, look, she's alone in there
all damn day.

310
00:18:41,026 --> 00:18:43,324
The only time she's got company
is when I come to see her.

311
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,519
That must be hard for her.

312
00:18:44,628 --> 00:18:47,722
I'm just sayin' it wouldn't hurt, you know,
if people went to see her.

313
00:18:47,899 --> 00:18:52,768
She's alone for a reason. I mean,
whether you want to admit it or not,

314
00:18:53,171 --> 00:18:55,163
there's a freak show going on in there.

315
00:18:55,407 --> 00:18:56,932
You are outta line, Greer.

316
00:18:57,042 --> 00:19:01,571
No, sir, I'm not, because it is part of
my job as a Master Sergeant to see to it

317
00:19:01,646 --> 00:19:05,810
that butter-bar Lieutenants like yourself
don't make mistakes.

318
00:19:07,552 --> 00:19:08,781
What did you just call me?

319
00:19:10,623 --> 00:19:11,850
You heard me.

320
00:19:14,727 --> 00:19:20,495
Okay, Master Sergeant, you tell me what is
so wrong with giving that girl comfort

321
00:19:20,766 --> 00:19:22,131
in what might be her last few days?

322
00:19:22,234 --> 00:19:24,567
Because you don't know when
that day's gonna be.

323
00:19:24,637 --> 00:19:25,968
You don't know how much I care about her.

324
00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:31,133
I think I do, and you're not the only one.

325
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:37,207
I pray for her every single night,
but that girl is turning into the enemy.

326
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,645
And the day is gonna come.

327
00:19:59,774 --> 00:20:01,674
Hey. Mind if I...

328
00:20:02,677 --> 00:20:06,169
So many of you are keeping your distance
from us, I appreciate it.

329
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,745
They're all boring.

330
00:20:12,053 --> 00:20:13,247
You're not missing a thing.

331
00:20:16,157 --> 00:20:20,925
So, the planet you guys...
I heard you called it Eden.

332
00:20:21,797 --> 00:20:23,196
- We did.
- I never got to go.

333
00:20:23,332 --> 00:20:25,061
Everybody said it was amazing.

334
00:20:29,972 --> 00:20:30,961
Do you miss it?

335
00:20:31,974 --> 00:20:34,841
Honestly, my memory of it is just now
coming back to me in pieces.

336
00:20:34,978 --> 00:20:36,808
Hey, at least it's coming back.

337
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,570
In flashes. Just moments, you know?

338
00:20:40,016 --> 00:20:44,611
In fact, the strangest memory came
back to me when I was sitting here.

339
00:20:45,822 --> 00:20:47,550
What?

340
00:20:47,624 --> 00:20:49,558
I'd be embarrassed to say it.

341
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,619
Well, now I have to know.

342
00:20:54,497 --> 00:20:56,692
Skinny-dipping. There was a lake...

343
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,802
Yeah, no... I've heard about it already.

344
00:21:00,638 --> 00:21:03,607
People were doing that before you guys
decided to stay.

345
00:21:03,774 --> 00:21:05,035
That's right.

346
00:21:09,213 --> 00:21:10,373
What about when you were alone?

347
00:21:11,515 --> 00:21:13,278
You must have checked out
the obelisk, right?

348
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,977
I don't...

349
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:17,453
- It was there the whole time.
- I...

350
00:21:17,755 --> 00:21:19,280
Whoa. Your nose is bleeding.

351
00:21:20,424 --> 00:21:21,857
What's happening?

352
00:21:23,694 --> 00:21:25,662
We need help over here!

353
00:21:27,798 --> 00:21:29,322
Somebody get help!

354
00:21:40,178 --> 00:21:41,372
Dr. Rush.

355
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,610
Found you. Hey.

356
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:48,679
I see we've come out of FTL.
Anything interesting out there?

357
00:21:50,288 --> 00:21:52,553
There's always something interesting
out there.

358
00:21:54,927 --> 00:21:57,919
I've just been going over
the shuttle's navigational data,

359
00:21:58,464 --> 00:22:01,194
<i>trying to figure out the path you took
back to Destiny.</i>

360
00:22:01,334 --> 00:22:02,426
And?

361
00:22:02,768 --> 00:22:08,229
Well, it seems you were there
and then you were here.

362
00:22:09,242 --> 00:22:10,471
Nothing in between.

363
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:15,007
I wish I could help you with that, but I
fell asleep there, and I woke up here.

364
00:22:15,149 --> 00:22:16,206
Yeah.

365
00:22:17,317 --> 00:22:22,118
<i>Listen, I heard that you've learned
what Destiny's original mission was.</i>

366
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:23,778
Yes, we have.

367
00:22:24,023 --> 00:22:26,219
In search of a message from
the moment of creation.

368
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,797
I don't know about "message."
"Fingerprints" might be a better word.

369
00:22:31,598 --> 00:22:34,294
A sign that some intelligence
may have had a hand in all of this.

370
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:35,592
The hand of God?

371
00:22:35,669 --> 00:22:38,001
I don't know about that either,
I'm afraid. I'm a scientist.

372
00:22:38,706 --> 00:22:40,570
I'd go so far as to call it evidence

373
00:22:40,842 --> 00:22:44,539
of an intelligence having existed
prior to its own potential to exist.

374
00:22:45,612 --> 00:22:48,342
You just can't bring yourself to call it
a miracle, can you?

375
00:22:49,817 --> 00:22:51,216
No, actually.

376
00:22:51,486 --> 00:22:53,614
- Well, I'd like to hear more.
- Oh, why bother?

377
00:22:54,822 --> 00:22:58,315
Call it God's will
and you needn't give it another thought.

378
00:22:58,626 --> 00:23:01,356
He must have brought us here for a reason.

379
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,456
He must have saved us for a reason.

380
00:23:03,531 --> 00:23:07,434
Yeah, saved from what? Do you remember?

381
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,798
I mean, the burning bush spoke to Moses?

382
00:23:10,905 --> 00:23:14,364
Gabriel, was it, spoke to Abraham, yet you,

383
00:23:14,443 --> 00:23:17,936
you were returned here with no proof
of your savior one way or the other.

384
00:23:20,449 --> 00:23:21,882
I'll leave you to your work.

385
00:23:26,388 --> 00:23:27,582
Let me ask you...

386
00:23:28,091 --> 00:23:31,491
The shuttle was restored to
its original condition

387
00:23:31,595 --> 00:23:34,962
by the aliens who sent you here,
better than it was before, even.

388
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:38,430
Well, that sounds to me more like
the work of God than aliens.

389
00:23:38,635 --> 00:23:42,230
Well, if this shuttle has been restored
so perfectly, then why weren't all of you?

390
00:23:43,139 --> 00:23:45,869
I mean, Norris wasn't born
with astigmatism, was he?

391
00:23:45,943 --> 00:23:48,878
Mr. Chan surely had a full head of hair
at one time.

392
00:23:50,213 --> 00:23:52,614
All of you have enormous gaps
in your memory.

393
00:23:53,584 --> 00:23:54,915
What's your point?

394
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:56,884
Well, either He's lost his touch,

395
00:23:57,288 --> 00:23:59,346
or God's got nothing to do with this.

396
00:24:00,725 --> 00:24:02,693
<i>Rush, this is Young.
Is Caine with you?</i>

397
00:24:04,028 --> 00:24:05,052
Yeah, go ahead.

398
00:24:05,196 --> 00:24:07,722
<i>Tell him to come to the infirmary.
Val is dead.</i>

399
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,267
It was a severe head trauma,

400
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:16,170
as bad as if she was struck
with a sledgehammer.

401
00:24:16,308 --> 00:24:17,968
There's nothing anyone could've done.

402
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,142
- What happened?
Nothing.

403
00:24:20,412 --> 00:24:23,244
She just grabbed her head,
and her nose started to bleed.

404
00:24:23,382 --> 00:24:24,406
Are you sure?

405
00:24:24,483 --> 00:24:26,973
She was just talking with Eli
in the observation room.

406
00:24:27,052 --> 00:24:28,110
There were witnesses.

407
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,619
She was already dead
when we got there.

408
00:24:29,755 --> 00:24:33,122
And still there's evidence of skull
fracture, hemorrhage, brain swelling.

409
00:24:33,825 --> 00:24:35,589
- I don't understand.
Neither do we.

410
00:24:36,028 --> 00:24:39,759
Something caused this. A blunt force
injury doesn't happen spontaneously.

411
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:42,267
Something that happened on the planet?

412
00:24:45,338 --> 00:24:48,466
I don't know. I wish I did, I swear.

413
00:24:48,908 --> 00:24:50,671
Look, this might be a long shot,

414
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:54,804
but I'd like to put you and the others
from the shuttle under hypnosis.

415
00:24:55,114 --> 00:24:57,674
See if I can stimulate memories
from your subconscious.

416
00:24:57,784 --> 00:24:59,411
The IOA teach you that?

417
00:24:59,619 --> 00:25:00,813
Yeah, they did.

418
00:25:01,087 --> 00:25:02,486
Anything else I should know about?

419
00:25:02,655 --> 00:25:04,816
That I was a little overqualified for HR?

420
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,886
I say we do it.

421
00:25:09,096 --> 00:25:11,621
I'd like to tell the
others about Val first.

422
00:25:12,665 --> 00:25:13,894
Yeah, of course.

423
00:25:16,403 --> 00:25:18,894
In the meantime,
I'll take a shot at an autopsy.

424
00:25:18,972 --> 00:25:20,303
Maybe I missed something
in the observation.

425
00:25:20,407 --> 00:25:21,874
I don't think you missed anything.

426
00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:25,138
I don't think so either, but I don't really
know what else I can do.

427
00:25:25,212 --> 00:25:27,340
Hey, listen, you're doing good.

428
00:25:28,283 --> 00:25:29,772
Actually, I'm not.

429
00:25:39,761 --> 00:25:40,887
Come in.

430
00:25:47,969 --> 00:25:49,062
How are you?

431
00:25:50,473 --> 00:25:53,134
Still me. Mostly, anyway.

432
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,801
Good to know.

433
00:25:56,244 --> 00:25:58,475
Once I've changed completely,

434
00:25:58,546 --> 00:26:01,607
the Colonel will see me as a threat,
won't he?

435
00:26:03,352 --> 00:26:04,478
I think so.

436
00:26:06,188 --> 00:26:07,485
What will he do?

437
00:26:08,925 --> 00:26:09,982
Remove the threat.

438
00:26:12,361 --> 00:26:13,692
One way or another.

439
00:26:14,497 --> 00:26:15,691
Will it be you?

440
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,927
Yes, ma'am. I think so.

441
00:26:24,474 --> 00:26:25,964
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

442
00:26:28,078 --> 00:26:29,773
I couldn't let it be anyone else.

443
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,808
Is that what you came to tell me?

444
00:26:35,452 --> 00:26:37,283
I came to ask for your forgiveness,

445
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,390
for when the time does come.

446
00:26:43,093 --> 00:26:44,287
Of course.

447
00:26:44,628 --> 00:26:46,324
If I could please hear you say it.

448
00:26:49,332 --> 00:26:51,028
I forgive you, Ronald.

449
00:26:53,337 --> 00:26:54,827
Thank you.

450
00:26:56,674 --> 00:26:58,142
That's important.

451
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:02,876
Take care of Matt.

452
00:27:03,048 --> 00:27:04,948
You don't even have to ask me to say it.

453
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:08,518
I already tried once to keep him from
comin' to see you,

454
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:10,817
but you know how stubborn he is.

455
00:27:14,993 --> 00:27:16,517
I could tell him to stay away.

456
00:27:16,628 --> 00:27:18,186
That might be a good idea.

457
00:27:18,831 --> 00:27:20,128
I mean, for him.

458
00:27:23,302 --> 00:27:24,894
Will I see you again?

459
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:28,467
It would be better for me
if I said goodbye now.

460
00:27:29,808 --> 00:27:31,037
Okay.

461
00:27:36,014 --> 00:27:37,107
I'm sorry,

462
00:27:40,053 --> 00:27:41,748
but I can't do that.

463
00:27:43,256 --> 00:27:44,553
Goodbye.

464
00:27:45,758 --> 00:27:47,351
Goodbye, Miss Armstrong.

465
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:07,076
I love you, Matt. Know that.

466
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:15,546
I wish that I could have shown you off
to my friends and hear you say

467
00:28:15,623 --> 00:28:17,784
"dang" in front of my mom.

468
00:28:19,461 --> 00:28:23,761
I wish we could have grown old together
and had a family,

469
00:28:26,101 --> 00:28:28,569
but I'm grateful for what we had.

470
00:28:33,242 --> 00:28:35,141
Please take care of everyone.

471
00:28:36,811 --> 00:28:40,713
You're far more important to holding
this place together than you know.

472
00:28:42,585 --> 00:28:47,488
Take care of Eli, because he's going to
take care of you in his own way.

473
00:28:50,192 --> 00:28:51,853
And forgive Ronald.

474
00:28:53,896 --> 00:28:59,027
He did what he had to do, and if it was
going to be anyone, I am glad it was him.

475
00:29:01,304 --> 00:29:02,293
Okay?

476
00:29:06,109 --> 00:29:07,098
I love you.

477
00:29:10,414 --> 00:29:14,214
Just relax. Breathe deeply, slowly.

478
00:29:15,586 --> 00:29:18,987
- You're on the planet now. Eden.
- Yes.

479
00:29:20,657 --> 00:29:21,919
What do you feel?

480
00:29:23,093 --> 00:29:26,494
There's a nip in the air.
I can see my breath.

481
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:28,056
It's morning.

482
00:29:28,231 --> 00:29:30,097
Yes, the sun is out.

483
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,834
Tell me what you see.

484
00:29:34,638 --> 00:29:38,075
<i>The lake outside camp.
It's beautiful.</i>

485
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:40,933
Val is here.

486
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,942
What is Val saying?

487
00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:47,575
She's just smiling.

488
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:53,117
We spent the night together
under the stars.

489
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:57,023
The others don't know. It's our secret.

490
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,157
Where are the others now?

491
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:01,188
Working.

492
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:05,301
We're always working.

493
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:08,840
It's just too late in the season.
It's a waste of time.

494
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:11,574
Well, we need to try.

495
00:30:12,045 --> 00:30:14,945
And we will, okay?
We'll try again in the spring.

496
00:30:15,015 --> 00:30:16,675
For now we should just gather
what we can.

497
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,716
We've picked
most of this area clean.

498
00:30:18,852 --> 00:30:20,751
Well then,
at least gather some firewood.

499
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:25,647
All right? I mean, there's no way
of knowing how long this winter will last.

500
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:27,791
It's just getting colder every night.

501
00:30:33,767 --> 00:30:34,791
He's afraid.

502
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:36,324
Who is?

503
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:39,230
Caine. Winter is coming.

504
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:44,874
All right. It's another day. The afternoon.

505
00:30:45,946 --> 00:30:47,937
- Yes.
- Where are you now?

506
00:30:48,115 --> 00:30:49,172
In the forest.

507
00:30:51,085 --> 00:30:52,712
Chopping trees for firewood.

508
00:30:52,787 --> 00:30:54,482
- With Caine?
- No.

509
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,314
No.

510
00:30:58,225 --> 00:30:59,318
Val!

511
00:31:00,461 --> 00:31:01,553
- No...
- Peter...

512
00:31:01,962 --> 00:31:03,361
Val! Val...

513
00:31:03,497 --> 00:31:05,488
Peter, what's happening?

514
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:09,696
She died on the planet.

515
00:31:09,905 --> 00:31:12,032
- Are you sure?
- I remember now.

516
00:31:12,474 --> 00:31:15,602
It was before winter came.
I was falling a tree.

517
00:31:15,844 --> 00:31:17,175
I didn't see her coming.

518
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:19,069
She couldn't get out of the way.

519
00:31:19,414 --> 00:31:22,042
I saw her die! Months ago!

520
00:31:22,417 --> 00:31:23,884
How is that...

521
00:31:24,553 --> 00:31:26,146
Peter!

522
00:31:28,524 --> 00:31:30,822
This is Wray! I have a medical emergency!

523
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,989
Make a hole!

524
00:31:54,283 --> 00:31:57,616
This time the symptoms are consistent
with dehydration and hypothermia.

525
00:31:58,221 --> 00:32:00,588
You said the hypnosis was working.
He was starting to remember.

526
00:32:00,923 --> 00:32:03,654
Yeah, the last thing
he remembered was Val died on the planet.

527
00:32:03,961 --> 00:32:07,362
Well, based on the condition of his body,
I would say Peter died on the planet, too,

528
00:32:07,898 --> 00:32:09,058
from extreme exposure.

529
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,298
But he said Val died months ago,
before the winter.

530
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,135
Months ago?

531
00:32:17,441 --> 00:32:18,670
What if they're dying again?

532
00:32:19,777 --> 00:32:20,836
In order?

533
00:32:24,215 --> 00:32:26,649
Lieutenant Scott,
I need you to locate Dr. Caine

534
00:32:26,751 --> 00:32:30,812
and the other members of the shuttle
and escort them to the infirmary now.

535
00:32:32,924 --> 00:32:34,391
Rachel, open the door, please.

536
00:32:42,133 --> 00:32:43,863
Please help me.

537
00:32:45,103 --> 00:32:46,503
We're going to help you.

538
00:32:46,939 --> 00:32:48,930
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
maybe you shouldn't touch her.

539
00:32:49,174 --> 00:32:51,268
- I don't want to die.
- We're gonna get you to the infirmary.

540
00:32:55,681 --> 00:32:56,909
She was like this when we found her.

541
00:32:56,983 --> 00:32:58,210
Put her over here.

542
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,217
Strip down and get your ass into decon.
This could be anything.

543
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:03,755
- I told him.
Go!

544
00:33:05,225 --> 00:33:07,489
Please help me.

545
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,064
Hey.

546
00:33:22,108 --> 00:33:23,474
I want to know what the hell's going on.

547
00:33:24,177 --> 00:33:25,406
I swear I don't know.

548
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:28,844
Well, you're going to sit down with Wray until
you figure it out, or I swear to God...

549
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:30,405
We are members of your crew.

550
00:33:30,518 --> 00:33:32,850
No, you're former members.
You left by choice!

551
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:35,115
And if what's happening to you people
spreads to the rest of us,

552
00:33:35,223 --> 00:33:36,747
you're going to be dropped off
on the next planet!

553
00:33:36,823 --> 00:33:37,812
Sir, it's not his fault.

554
00:33:37,892 --> 00:33:40,759
None of this would be happening
if Caine had not talked those people

555
00:33:40,828 --> 00:33:42,022
into staying on that planet.

556
00:33:42,096 --> 00:33:43,120
I wanted to stay, too.

557
00:33:43,231 --> 00:33:44,892
And that's what would have
happened to you.

558
00:33:46,701 --> 00:33:49,330
Camile, this is Young.
Dr. Caine is your next volunteer.

559
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:51,237
- Colonel...
- Go. Now.

560
00:34:12,628 --> 00:34:13,788
Chloe?

561
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:18,322
Chloe.

562
00:34:21,169 --> 00:34:23,832
I thought you should know what's goin'
on with those folks from the shuttle...

563
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,168
- Go away, Matt.
- What?

564
00:34:25,241 --> 00:34:27,300
I said leave. Now.

565
00:34:32,348 --> 00:34:35,681
I'll come back later, then. All right?

566
00:34:47,364 --> 00:34:49,662
All right, everyone,
we know we're fighting hypothermia here,

567
00:34:49,733 --> 00:34:51,132
so let's keep their core temperatures up.

568
00:34:52,902 --> 00:34:54,336
What do you see?

569
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,768
Snow is falling.

570
00:35:09,054 --> 00:35:10,987
The shuttle is our only shelter now.

571
00:35:15,193 --> 00:35:16,421
It's so cold.

572
00:35:19,197 --> 00:35:20,927
<i>We lost power days ago.</i>

573
00:35:21,866 --> 00:35:24,461
Something vital is broken
and none of us know how to fix it.

574
00:35:25,303 --> 00:35:30,139
It's airtight, so we have to leave
the door ajar or we'll suffocate.

575
00:35:30,976 --> 00:35:35,607
<i>We still have some food,
and Peter has made some candles</i>

576
00:35:36,448 --> 00:35:37,609
<i>to keep us warm.</i>

577
00:35:39,784 --> 00:35:41,548
They provide enough light to read

578
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:45,053
and share our evening meal.

579
00:35:47,226 --> 00:35:48,625
Peter is still with you?

580
00:35:51,865 --> 00:35:53,559
In his heart, he's already left us.

581
00:35:56,268 --> 00:35:57,327
I try to tell him...

582
00:35:57,404 --> 00:35:58,836
It'll be all right, Peter.

583
00:36:01,108 --> 00:36:05,511
No, it won't be all right.
Nothing will be all right.

584
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:07,442
But by morning, he's gone.

585
00:36:14,588 --> 00:36:15,680
Okay. Um...

586
00:36:20,994 --> 00:36:22,223
It's the last night.

587
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:26,657
<i>The night before you woke up inside the
shuttle and Destiny was there.</i>

588
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,331
Yes. I remember.

589
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,029
Tell me what you see.

590
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:34,372
It's very dark.

591
00:36:34,909 --> 00:36:36,342
There's no pain. Just...

592
00:36:36,711 --> 00:36:37,770
Just the cold.

593
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,174
Who else is there with you?

594
00:36:41,816 --> 00:36:44,183
- What?
- They're all dead. Frozen.

595
00:36:49,023 --> 00:36:50,082
I'm alone.

596
00:36:51,593 --> 00:36:52,582
What are you doing?

597
00:36:52,795 --> 00:36:54,387
<i>There's nowhere for me to go.</i>

598
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,526
<i>Nothing to do now but pray.</i>

599
00:37:06,075 --> 00:37:08,510
The next thing I remember is
waking up on the shuttle

600
00:37:08,578 --> 00:37:10,705
<i>and seeing Destiny out the window.</i>

601
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:14,709
Is that all?

602
00:37:16,886 --> 00:37:18,820
I wish I had more answers for you.

603
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:21,988
Me, too.

604
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,085
But you won't have to drop me off
at the next planet, Colonel.

605
00:37:27,031 --> 00:37:29,590
I expect I'll be dead before
you come back out of FTL.

606
00:37:30,134 --> 00:37:31,465
You don't know that.

607
00:37:32,603 --> 00:37:34,434
Yes, I do.

608
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:41,974
Because now I remember something
that no one ever should.

609
00:37:45,616 --> 00:37:47,049
I'm already dead.

610
00:37:48,652 --> 00:37:51,382
Eli, did you leave this in the shuttle?

611
00:37:51,856 --> 00:37:52,881
No. Why?

612
00:37:53,258 --> 00:37:54,554
Well, somebody did.

613
00:38:04,936 --> 00:38:06,335
They all died in their sleep.

614
00:38:07,772 --> 00:38:10,969
- With symptoms of severe exposure?
- Yeah.

615
00:38:11,544 --> 00:38:16,174
But I'm guessing whatever the aliens did
to bring you back, it was only temporary.

616
00:38:16,782 --> 00:38:20,444
You're all just reverting back to
the state they probably found you in.

617
00:38:23,155 --> 00:38:26,489
I'm sorry.
I did everything I could think of.

618
00:38:27,626 --> 00:38:28,924
It's not your fault.

619
00:38:34,033 --> 00:38:35,523
How much time do I have left?

620
00:38:37,204 --> 00:38:38,329
Not much.

621
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,104
May I be allowed to see the stars
one last time?

622
00:38:42,575 --> 00:38:44,601
Yeah, of course. Go ahead.

623
00:38:48,115 --> 00:38:50,776
I would like very much not to be alone.

624
00:39:06,466 --> 00:39:09,264
Wow. I forgot how beautiful this view was.

625
00:39:10,905 --> 00:39:13,874
Maybe they were just giving you
the chance to see it one more time,

626
00:39:14,908 --> 00:39:17,901
or to say goodbye to all of us.

627
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:23,041
This isn't me. At least not the man I was.

628
00:39:24,018 --> 00:39:26,783
That's what Dr. Rush was trying to tell me
in his own way.

629
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:29,182
I just didn't believe him.

630
00:39:33,028 --> 00:39:35,120
This body's nothing but a shadow,

631
00:39:37,866 --> 00:39:40,994
not reborn, but reanimated,

632
00:39:42,438 --> 00:39:43,735
and not by God,

633
00:39:44,273 --> 00:39:47,209
but by beings who can
rebuild a man's body,

634
00:39:48,711 --> 00:39:49,974
but not his soul.

635
00:39:53,716 --> 00:39:56,379
Maybe that's what you
and Colonel Young were sensing.

636
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:01,623
I don't feel that way now.

637
00:40:05,929 --> 00:40:07,396
That's kind of you to say.

638
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:15,832
But even though I have his thoughts
and some of his memories,

639
00:40:16,273 --> 00:40:18,468
I'm not the Robert Caine that God made.

640
00:40:22,513 --> 00:40:24,640
After all of this, you still believe?

641
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,583
That is faith, T.J.

642
00:40:29,387 --> 00:40:32,151
I believe that my soul
has already moved on,

643
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:36,486
and is looking down even now marveling

644
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,256
at how kind you are to comfort a shadow.

645
00:40:50,709 --> 00:40:54,303
You have to believe with all of your heart
that your daughter

646
00:40:54,846 --> 00:40:56,438
is in a better place.

647
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:02,277
The greatest gift that you can give her,

648
00:41:04,556 --> 00:41:09,016
and to all of us, is to live your life,

649
00:41:09,861 --> 00:41:15,391
<i>to fulfill Destiny's mission
and have faith in each other.</i>

650
00:41:36,089 --> 00:41:39,856
<i>If anyone's
listening, help us.</i>

651
00:41:41,362 --> 00:41:45,321
<i>Help us. Please.</i>

652
00:41:47,301 --> 00:41:48,768
<i>I don't want to die.</i>

653
00:41:52,674 --> 00:41:53,663
<i>Help us...</i>

654
00:41:57,545 --> 00:41:58,534
<i>Please...</i>
