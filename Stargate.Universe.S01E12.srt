00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:04,232
RUSH: This is what Destiny intended from
the moment it entered the star system.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,309
YOUNG: We are going to survive.
We are going to make it home.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,630
I'm telling you,
the ship came here for a reason!

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,199
RUSH: Destiny is powered
by the stars themselves.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,430
WRAY: He and Young
are bumping heads, yes.

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,750
Not sure which camp is the better choice.

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,279
YOUNG: We just pretend
nothing happened?

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,359
We need to be ready
for the next encounter.

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,237
For the sake of the crew.

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,594
For the sake of the crew.

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,790
Colonel, I'm curious about
the incident with Dr. Rush.

12
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,998
I managed to activate the systems
on the crashed ship. Aliens showed up.

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,551
YOUNG: Do not engage.
Chloe may be on board one of those ships.

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,153
RUSH: I don't think
they did want to destroy us.

15
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,515
What they really want is Destiny.

16
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,915
Hey, hey, hey, Mr. Hangman

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,991
Go get your rope

18
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,232
Your rope, your rope, your rope

19
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,438
Your daughters weren't careful

20
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,514
I fear that I am a slippery slope

21
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,391
Now even if I lay my head down at night

22
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:34,235
After a day I got perfectly right

23
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,630
She won't know

24
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,638
She won't know

25
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,710
Wait. No!

26
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,109
And you can't blame your mother

27
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,274
She's trying not to say
I was the worst mistake

28
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,035
And I wish that I could tell you right now

29
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,678
I love you

30
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,715
Mom.

31
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,398
So you won't know

32
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,276
You won't know

33
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,794
No!

34
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,352
Another nightmare?

35
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,711
Every time I close my eyes.

36
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,029
Maybe you should talk to T.J.

37
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,510
No, it's not the dream, it's...

38
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,835
What?

39
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,639
Look, you're...

40
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,392
They're gone, okay?

41
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,995
We got you back. You're safe now.

42
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,557
So, move on? Get over it, right?

43
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,039
That's not what I'm saying.

44
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,394
Forget it.

45
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,754
I want to help you.

46
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,957
No. It's fine. I just...

47
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,630
I just need to clear my head.

48
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,279
RUSH: Same dream?

49
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,635
Yeah.

50
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,429
Me, too.

51
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,911
What did they do to us?

52
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,716
I don't remember everything.

53
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,192
Yeah, me neither.

54
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,551
Maybe that's a good thing.

55
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,118
Everyone thinks we're safe.

56
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,998
They think that they'll never find us again.

57
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,157
We're not safe, are we?

58
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,349
No.

59
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,518
We need to talk.

60
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,196
I was thinking the same thing.

61
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,713
Were you, now?

62
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,431
The communication stones.

63
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,790
- What about them?
- You took one.

64
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,472
It's the only explanation.

65
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,916
You were the first to open the box.
You kept one for yourself.

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,035
And why would I do that?

67
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,874
Maybe you thought it was some
kind of insurance policy, I don't know.

68
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,678
You probably thought
it wasn't safe to keep in your room,

69
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,991
especially after that whole incident
with Spencer's gun,

70
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,116
so you kept one with you.

71
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,673
That's how the aliens got hold of one,
and that's how I wound up on that ship.

72
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,434
Oh, well.

73
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,233
Doesn't sound like a denial, Rush.

74
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,039
What we should really be worried about
is how they found us in the first place.

75
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,633
Well, I figure they tracked the signal
from the stone...

76
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,119
We don't even know
how that signal works.

77
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,474
Maybe they're smarter than us?

78
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,473
Well, they're advanced, sure,
but not as advanced as the Ancients.

79
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,192
I suspect it's something much simpler.

80
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,395
Like what?

81
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,038
Subspace tracking device.

82
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,599
We took care of the ship you brought over.

83
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,196
Yeah, but there may be another one
attached to the outside of the hull.

84
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,553
Wait a minute. Where is this coming from?

85
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,312
I was in direct neural contact
with one of the aliens for quite some time.

86
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,916
Ever since,
I've been having flashes. Images.

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,228
Of what?

88
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,595
You don't know?

89
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,989
No, I don't know, but what I do know is,

90
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,993
they've been tracking this ship for
some time. Long, long before we got here.

91
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,436
For them, Destiny's something
like an obsession.

92
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,752
Look, we're out of FTL,
will be for several hours.

93
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,794
Now's the perfect time to take a look.

94
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,833
SCOTT: Kino's through.

95
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,750
Mr. Brody, please dial back
the tensile strength of the shield.

96
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,319
Roger that.

97
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,471
You know, it's a big ship.
This could take a while.

98
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,831
You have something better to do?

99
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,353
Keep me posted.

100
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,797
Can I have a word with you, Colonel?

101
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,199
All right.

102
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,428
Not here.

103
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,239
I don't know exactly what happened
on that planet between you and Rush,

104
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,038
and maybe I don't want to know.

105
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,394
Spit it out, Sergeant.

106
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,995
Well, we never did find out
who put that weapon in your quarters, sir.

107
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,115
No.

108
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,753
There has been some speculation.

109
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,034
I'll bet.

110
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,150
As far as I'm concerned,
we were better off without him.

111
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,836
I just want you to know
that whatever happens...

112
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,469
RUSH ON RADIO:
Colonel Young, come in.

113
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,549
Go ahead.

114
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,073
We've found it.

115
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,193
It's on the underside of the ship. I just...

116
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:27,230
I fed the Kino track into the shuttle
controls, so it should lead you right there.

117
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,676
Anytime now, Lieutenant.

118
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,909
Yes, sir.

119
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,839
All right, guys, ship's jumping to FTL
in a little over one hour.

120
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,873
That's plenty of time.

121
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,072
What is this place?

122
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,388
Well, as far as I can tell,
it's some kind of Ancient research lab.

123
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,709
Not exactly ideal for our purposes,

124
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,433
but the level of connectivity with the
ship's main systems should be adequate.

125
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,712
Do we have to do it now?

126
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,268
We'll never get a better opportunity.

127
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,154
You should really get your people
in position.

128
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,075
CHLOE: Eli!

129
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,510
Hey. What are you doing here?

130
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,910
I want to see the alien ship.

131
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,868
You know it's just parked there to track us.

132
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,030
I know, but I want to see it.

133
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,194
Come in.

134
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,559
There it is.

135
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,757
CHLOE: How long has it been on the ship?

136
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,319
Rush says since before we got here,

137
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,358
although it's not entirely clear
how he knows.

138
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,634
He knows.

139
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,393
All right. Weapons hot,

140
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,553
target locked.

141
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,793
Weapons firing.

142
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,994
That's it.

143
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,356
They can't get to us anymore.

144
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,115
VOLKER ON RADIO: Brody?

145
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,272
Brody, where are you?

146
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,279
Hydroponics.

147
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,555
All right, stay there. It's on.

148
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,554
What, now?

149
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,593
You signed off on this.

150
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,875
Yeah, I know, I know. I just...

151
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,754
Stand by.

152
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,474
- Hey.
- Hi.

153
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,635
Didn't expect to see you down here.

154
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,553
Yeah, I just wanted to check on
some of the medicinals here.

155
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,993
Right, sure.

156
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,229
Brody!

157
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,314
Yeah, yeah, I'll meet up with you
in about a half an hour. Okay? Bye.

158
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:00,957
That was... That was just Volker
and his bridge club. So...

159
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,755
Okay.

160
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,718
Docking procedure.

161
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,999
Sir, I'm reading a negative
on the docking clamps.

162
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,433
Let's reset.

163
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,513
Still negative.

164
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,637
Eli, we've got a problem.
The docking clamps will not engage.

165
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,668
What? That's impossible. Hang on.

166
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,629
Eli...

167
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,273
What the hell?

168
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,713
I'm locked out.

169
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,990
What do you mean, you're locked out?

170
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,592
Someone's transferring controls
to another station. I've got nothing.

171
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,715
Sir, the door won't open either.

172
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,398
We're jumping to FTL
in about eight minutes.

173
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,119
What happens
if the ship's not locked down?

174
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,760
The shield won't envelop the shuttle.

175
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,275
And what?

176
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,669
I don't know for sure.
Nothing good, I know that.

177
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,829
Eli...

178
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,108
The shuttle wouldn't go into FTL
with the rest of the ship.

179
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,428
Which means what?

180
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,195
I'm not sure, but I think
the shuttle would be vaporized.

181
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,513
Seven minutes.

182
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,148
All right.

183
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:23,794
Eli, let's... Let's think this through. You
said somebody was transferring controls?

184
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,108
Yeah, that's what it looks like from here.

185
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,589
Well, can you do something about it?

186
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,069
- If I...
- Stay calm. Take your time.

187
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,514
Five minutes, sir.

188
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,238
I'll bet you a buck.

189
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,755
Rush, this is Young. Over.

190
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,518
Greer, this is Colonel Young.

191
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,635
Go ahead, sir.

192
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,435
Take a detail. Find Rush now.

193
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,714
Yes, sir.

194
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,749
Four minutes.

195
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,432
Stop it. Stop it now.

196
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,509
Chloe, we've talked about this...

197
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,830
The shuttle docking clamps won't engage.

198
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,036
- What?
- You have to stop.

199
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,872
- But I can't.
- They're going to die.

200
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,518
I can't stop in the middle of this.

201
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,750
- They are going to die!
- Damn it!

202
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,237
Eli, this is Dr. Rush, come in.

203
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,271
- Go ahead.
- Now, listen carefully.

204
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,158
I'm in the process of transferring
access to the computer

205
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,595
away from the Control Interface Room.

206
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,356
Now, there's nothing
you can do to stop that.

207
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,908
All you're doing is slowing it down.

208
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,558
Let me complete the transfer,
then I'll lock down the clamps manually.

209
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,434
Don't listen to him, Eli.
Keep doing what you're doing.

210
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,274
Eli, we're in no-man's-land here.
Neither of us have control.

211
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,149
Now, let me finish before we jump to FTL.

212
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,196
Don't do it, Eli. That is an order.

213
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,838
Two minutes, sir.

214
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,913
- What's going on?
- The shuttle can't dock

215
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,989
and we're about to jump.

216
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,117
I didn't know the transfer
would cause this to happen.

217
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,511
- Shut it down.
- I don't have everything yet.

218
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,752
If I stop now, Eli's going to shut me out,
and our position will be compromised.

219
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,513
- Colonel?
- YOUNG: Negative.

220
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,194
Eli, do not let that man
take over a single system.

221
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,395
He's doing it anyway.

222
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,675
The transfer's almost complete.

223
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,952
I know why you're doing this.

224
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,157
I also know you agreed
that nobody should get hurt.

225
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,750
We could lose everyone on our side.
Shut it down!

226
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,837
I got it! I got it!

227
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,469
Let's go.

228
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,239
Good work, Eli.

229
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,908
So, where do we stand?

230
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,999
How much control do we have?

231
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,277
We're about to find out.

232
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,713
What the hell?

233
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,834
Come on.

234
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,469
Eli.

235
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,872
It's Rush.
He's sealing off corridors all over the ship.

236
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,714
Brody, why's your radio turned off?

237
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,678
JOHANSEN: Is there a problem?

238
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,434
BRODY: Sorry.

239
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,948
You weren't supposed to be down here.

240
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,155
Guys, what is it? What's...
What's happening?

241
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,154
- Get out of my way.
- PARK: Put the gun down.

242
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,631
- I'm not going to ask you again.
- Just take it easy.

243
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,157
Airman, what are you doing?

244
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,152
Something's going on, Lieutenant.
We're cut off from the rest of the ship.

245
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,152
I'm trying to report to the Colonel,
but these people won't let me through.

246
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,912
I'm sorry. It was inevitable

247
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,470
that a few people would be stuck
on the wrong side of the line.

248
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,437
- What line?
- We've sealed off Colonel Young

249
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,875
and most of the military personnel.

250
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,520
To put it bluntly, we've taken the ship.

251
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,997
Put the gun down.

252
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,433
Not a chance.

253
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,357
Camile, why you doing this?

254
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,998
Colonel Young's actions left me no choice.

255
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,709
I'm doing this on behalf of
all the civilians onboard this ship.

256
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,313
What do I do?

257
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,149
Well, we're not going to go shoot anybody.
Put the gun down.

258
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,119
WRAY: Now, everyone just needs
to remain calm.

259
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,716
This will be over soon enough.

260
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,828
Rush, this is Young.

261
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,673
I know exactly what you're trying to do,

262
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,230
and there is no way in hell
that I am going to let you get away with it.

263
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,072
I'm not acting alone, Colonel.

264
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,280
Besides, what's done is done.

265
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,915
I already have the food and water supplies,
plus control of all accessible systems

266
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,992
has been transferred over to the consoles
on my side of the line.

267
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,077
- ELI: Huh.
- What is it?

268
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,795
That...

269
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,753
That's not entirely true.

270
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,832
He stopped the transfer prematurely,
so I could lock down the shuttle,

271
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,275
which saved your lives, by the way...

272
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,634
Moving on.

273
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,153
That left us control with one key system,
life support.

274
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,992
So you mean
that we can shut down their heat

275
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,719
and air on the other side
whenever we want?

276
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,472
ELI: We wouldn't do that.

277
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,709
Do you have any idea
what's going on here?

278
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,713
No. As a matter of fact, I don't.
Am I the only one?

279
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,273
You've got our attention.
What do you want?

280
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,950
All military personnel
to hand over their weapons immediately

281
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,349
and submit to civilian authority.

282
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,839
Is that it?

283
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,878
Well, it does tend to be
how civilized people

284
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,909
structure their societies, Colonel,
be that as in nations or in microcosm.

285
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,513
- As opposed to what?
- Military dictatorship.

286
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,718
That's got to stop.

287
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,799
Well, Eli tells me
there might be a problem with your plan.

288
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,155
Something to do with life support.

289
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,270
I was hoping that he wouldn't notice that.

290
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,558
Anyway, I've done the calculations.

291
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:22,039
We're occupying a much larger area,
therefore we have a greater volume of air.

292
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,430
Plus, we have the hydroponics lab
producing some oxygen.

293
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,793
Not enough to make a difference.

294
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,559
If you cut us off right now,
we'd have at least three days.

295
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,592
Which is around about
the same amount of time you would have

296
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,591
to go without water.

297
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,875
If it comes down to a contest,

298
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,230
I'm not sure
what the final outcome would be,

299
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,753
but it wouldn't be pretty.

300
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,958
- It's not pretty now.
- Sergeant.

301
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,319
What did he say?

302
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,676
Nothing, but they're still pumping air
in here.

303
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,069
He'll give in. He's got no choice.

304
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,676
We have the Gate Room
and the communication room.

305
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,637
He's completely cut off.

306
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,955
Yeah, but he still has one thing
that might make a difference.

307
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,478
SCOTT: All right.
Come on, buddy, you got this.

308
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:32,873
It's a very complicated lock-out program,
okay? I'm going to need some time.

309
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,791
So, I got a head count.

310
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,633
Lieutenant Johansen
and Airman Dunning are unaccounted for,

311
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,678
so I think we can assume
that they are on the other side.

312
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,115
Of course, just because
someone's on the other side,

313
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,637
doesn't necessarily mean they're,
you know, on the other side.

314
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,029
- Obviously not.
- We have half a dozen civilians,

315
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,759
all of which claim to know nothing.

316
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,229
- What about Chloe?
- She's with them.

317
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,910
- Like I said...
- How's it coming?

318
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,432
Slowly, and it doesn't help
that I'm starting to get hungry.

319
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,078
Low blood sugar is not my friend.

320
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,912
It's not the food that I'm worried about.
It's the water.

321
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,070
If dehydration sets in,
we're going to be in a lot of trouble.

322
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,913
- Is there anything we can do about it?
- They've offered a trade.

323
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,276
A limited amount of food and water
in exchange for Eli.

324
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,759
- Me?
- I've already agreed to it.

325
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,671
Sir, he's the only one
who can get us around

326
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,318
whatever Rush did to those computers.

327
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,392
I know that and they know that,
and that's why they want Eli,

328
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,391
but there is another way in.

329
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,077
All right, guys, I'm here.

330
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,720
And as you can see,

331
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,078
I am alone.

332
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,075
Open the door.

333
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,514
Whoa!

334
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,553
Irony.

335
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,279
Put it down. Come on.

336
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,438
So, here we are.

337
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,751
I can't help but notice that you seem to be,
well, working with these people.

338
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,350
What did you think, I was a prisoner?

339
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,112
I was hoping they...

340
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,473
Wait a minute.

341
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,992
In the Control Room, when you came by,

342
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,270
were you just trying to distract me?

343
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,430
So that I wouldn't notice
what Rush was doing?

344
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,080
- What?
- Don't "What?" me.

345
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,149
No...

346
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,879
Of course not.

347
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,837
Look, I knew it was coming,
but I didn't know when.

348
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,519
Believe me or don't believe me.
It doesn't matter.

349
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,752
I guess... I'm just a little surprised

350
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,957
you're taking Rush's side against Young.

351
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,792
Rush was an inconvenience,

352
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,555
so Colonel Young left him on that planet
to die. Deliberately.

353
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,838
The hole the aliens cut in the hull
is on the other side of the line, on their six.

354
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,069
Suit up.

355
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,756
- Sir...
- Lieutenant, I already told you,

356
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,798
I want you here in case it doesn't work.

357
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,949
WOMAN: Really?

358
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,197
We shouldn't have given them
food and water.

359
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,998
It's just going to give them more time.

360
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,877
That doesn't matter.
They know they've got no choice.

361
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,428
Why don't they just give it up, then?

362
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,518
He's a full-bird colonel
in the United States Air Force.

363
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,958
He's used to getting his way,

364
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:21,192
but he also knows
that every military in the free world

365
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,078
takes orders from a civilian government.

366
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,230
We just need to stick together
until he remembers that.

367
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,398
I'll leave you to it.

368
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,634
To what?

369
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,350
Once again, Eli,
I find myself in need of your assistance.

370
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,075
What exactly are you doing?

371
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:53,995
We are going to squeeze every last ounce
of power out of the ship's systems,

372
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,436
and then when we're done,
we're going to find some more.

373
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,428
What for?

374
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,634
The shields. We're going to need them.

375
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,391
The tracking device was on that ship
that we blew up.

376
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,035
One tracking device was on that ship.

377
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,792
There's another one?

378
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,878
Surgically implanted in my chest,
next to my heart.

379
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,514
GREER: Colonel...

380
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,079
YOUNG: We got to go.

381
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,915
ELI: This is insane!

382
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,355
Does anyone else know about this?

383
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,796
Chloe. I had to be sure
she wasn't implanted, too.

384
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,075
- And?
- There's no surgical scar.

385
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,519
They're almost within weapons range.
I'm dialing up the shield.

386
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,635
Wait!

387
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:18,316
Maybe... Maybe that's the wrong plan.

388
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,712
I mean, maybe we should throw
everything we have into weapons.

389
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,995
We can't take on three ships at once.

390
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,071
Well, we can't run away from them either.

391
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,754
That's exactly why I have to do this.

392
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,513
If we can survive until the next jump,

393
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,795
they're going to realize
they can't get past the shields

394
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,359
- and they're going to give up.
- You don't know that.

395
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,431
That's the way it's been
for a long time, Eli.

396
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:43,071
They attack, they try and get onboard,
the ship's automated defenses stop them.

397
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,473
They're attacking us now

398
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,791
because they're hoping
we're going to make a mistake.

399
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,475
Don't!

400
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,072
- Eli, do you want to die?
- No.

401
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,434
- That's exactly what's going to happen...
- But...

402
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,192
...if you don't let me do this.

403
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,789
No.

404
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,277
- What's the matter with you?
- Right.

405
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,510
- What?
- Sure.

406
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,717
You'll open the door for Scott
and his team, and I'll go find Rush.

407
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,349
I just wanted to see
if there's anything you need.

408
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,953
You can let us out of here.

409
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,871
Don't worry, you won't have to
stay in here for much longer.

410
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,235
I know, because the Colonel's going
to take back the ship.

411
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,958
You don't have any idea
what you're up against.

412
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,439
I think we do.

413
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,638
Not a clue.
Sorry, but a bunch of civilians

414
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,790
up against the Colonel's training
and experience?

415
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,316
- It's about listening to reason.
- Not once you took this ship.

416
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,631
That made it war, and that's what we do.

417
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,438
It's not going to make
life on this ship any easier,

418
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,875
and it's not going to make
what those aliens did to you any better.

419
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,428
Neither will anything
you could possibly say to me.

420
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,990
- JOHANSEN: What was that?
- They're back.

421
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,709
WOMAN: What's happening?
WRAY: Stay here.

422
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,279
This is Wray. Report.

423
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,430
- We've got company.
- So I figured. Let's go.

424
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,874
Sergeant?

425
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,549
They're fine. I went easy on them.

426
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,674
ELI: That's it.
That's all the power we're going to get.

427
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,599
The shields are holding.

428
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,911
Listen up. If you have to use force, so be it,

429
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,753
but we still have to live
with these people tomorrow.

430
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,990
- Remember that. Go.
- JAMES: Yes, sir.

431
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,472
- What is going on?
- ELI: They found us again.

432
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,229
How?

433
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,075
We knew this was coming.
We're prepared.

434
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,354
Who's we?

435
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,752
I know Rush is the only person on this ship

436
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,070
who has any idea
what you've been through,

437
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,993
but it doesn't mean that you can trust him.

438
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,868
He saved my life when Colonel Young
was ready to sacrifice us both.

439
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,552
We can't afford to have a majority vote

440
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,870
every time a decision
needs to be made, Chloe.

441
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,871
- We need a leader.
- SCOTT: Chloe?

442
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,398
All right, put the gun down.
You guys okay?

443
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,517
- Yeah, we're fine.
- All right, come on, let's go.

444
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,992
You were surgically implanted
with a tracking device.

445
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,515
Is that what this was all about?

446
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,876
You thought if Young was in command
he'd, what? Throw you out of an airlock?

447
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:15,032
Given my previous experience,
it's hardly an unreasonable assumption.

448
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,873
And, remember, this was your idea.

449
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,270
Doesn't matter whose idea it was.
It's over.

450
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,311
Everybody down, now!

451
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,197
On the floor! Now!

452
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,158
Get down! I said, get down!

453
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,152
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Just wait.

454
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,434
Greer...

455
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,117
Get the weapons online.

456
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,150
- He can't.
- Why?

457
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,276
I created a separate lockout code
for that system.

458
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,679
- Give him the code.
- No.

459
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,591
- We're under attack.
- I know.

460
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,478
The best form of defense is to
devote all of our power to the shields.

461
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,120
- That's not your decision.
- It's already been done.

462
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,476
Really? Well,
maybe I should just shoot you right now.

463
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,554
SCOTT: Colonel?

464
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,112
Get him out of here.

465
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,148
Wait. He has a transmitter
implanted in his chest.

466
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,639
- Eli, no...
- That's how they've been following us.

467
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,554
Even if we survive to the next jump,
they'll just track us again.

468
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,637
T.J., take care of it.

469
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,158
- What?
- Cut it out.

470
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,758
- I can't just go digging around in his chest.
- She's not qualified for this.

471
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,829
We'll use the stones.

472
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,239
- We'll get someone...
- We're not equipped for this.

473
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,594
Are you crazy? This is insane!

474
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,717
You know that we've got
to get that transmitter out.

475
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,792
Sir, I don't recommend giving up
any military personnel

476
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,189
at this particular moment.

477
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,599
CHLOE: I'll do it.

478
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,789
I don't need to know what I'm doing.
It won't be me, right?

479
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,715
T.J., this is Dr. Brightman.

480
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,313
- Hi.
- BRIGHTMAN: Lieutenant.

481
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,074
Thank you. Okay. What did you give him?

482
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,110
An anesthetic I made from the venom
of a creature we ran into a while back.

483
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,031
In low doses,
it'll knock you out pretty good.

484
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,157
You gave him alien venom? Is that safe?

485
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,038
Well, without it,
we'd all be dead right now.

486
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,155
Okay.

487
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,196
I thought at first we were going
to have to go in blind,

488
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,159
but then Eli, he's one of our people,
came up with this.

489
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,310
It's a camera. He took it out of a Kino.

490
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,710
- What's a...
- It's like a video transmitter.

491
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,791
Anyway, we took it apart
and mounted it on that,

492
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,633
and that way
we can go in thoracoscopically.

493
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,433
What is that?

494
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,270
- Yeah, we're under attack.
- What?

495
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,555
Shields are holding. We're good.

496
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,998
Welcome to Destiny.

497
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,790
- All right, that's it.
- YOUNG: That's it? We got weapons?

498
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,189
I found a way around the lock-out,
but I think...

499
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,395
What?

500
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,233
I think Rush might be right about this one.

501
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,914
If I'm reading this correctly,
the shields can't take much more.

502
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,833
- All the more reason to shoot back.
- We can't spare the power.

503
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,559
Weaken the shields even a little, and
I think they might collapse completely.

504
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,039
Well, that's what's going
to happen anyway, isn't it?

505
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,032
Yes, but maybe, if we're lucky,
not before we jump.

506
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,473
- Maybe?
- Yeah.

507
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,710
You got something
I can hold this open with? Thank you.

508
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,316
Lieutenant, can you hold that, please?
Thank you. Hold it up. Thank you.

509
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,393
Okay. Okay, I see it.

510
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,117
Getting it out's going to be
a bit tricky, but...

511
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,679
Are you okay?

512
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,036
- Oh, God. Oh, my God.
- JOHANSEN: Chloe?

513
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,311
Eli, this is Scott.
We just lost the connection.

514
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,709
- What the heck is going on down there?
- YOUNG: Say again?

515
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,678
We've lost the connection.
The doctor is gone.

516
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:58,036
Maybe there's too much interference
with all the enemy fire on the shields?

517
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,793
- Fix it.
- What? I'm guessing as it is!

518
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,710
Sorry, you're on your own.
T.J., you get that thing out of him.

519
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,234
Shields aren't going to last much longer.
There's nothing I can do.

520
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,073
- How long till we jump?
- Just over a minute.

521
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,589
SCOTT: T.J...
JOHANSEN: I can't!

522
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,671
You get that thing out of him right now,
or I'm going to have to!

523
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,273
WRAY: He's coming to!

524
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,998
- Hold him down, hold him down!
- What do I do?

525
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,470
- Give him another dose of anesthetic.
- What are you doing to me?

526
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,835
Hold him steady, hold him steady.

527
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,436
Okay, I can see it.

528
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,954
Chloe, I need you to hold this.

529
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,115
Okay.

530
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,679
There it is.

531
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:50,478
Okay. All right, I got it. Now pull it out.

532
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,351
SCOTT: I got it. Give it here.

533
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,314
We got it.

534
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,510
Shields are barely registering!

535
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,713
We're jumping!

536
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,508
Okay, we can close him up. Nice work.

537
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,715
How'd we do, sir?

538
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,360
Well, the ship's taken some damage.
Eli's looking into it.

539
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,635
Anyway, we're still here.

540
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:14,271
All right, everyone, I need all of you
to head back into your quarters now.

541
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,308
Everyone.

542
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,312
Sir, we can't guard them all
if we let them split up.

543
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,072
It's over, Sergeant.

544
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,755
All right, people, you heard the man.
Let's go.

545
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,513
- So?
- I'm open to suggestions.

546
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,398
Obviously, we need to
find a way to work together.

547
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,914
Pretend it never happened, you mean?

548
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,759
You shouldn't have left him on the planet.

549
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,671
You think I don't know that?

550
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,398
It's not over, sir.

551
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,879
No, it isn't.

552
00:40:24,879 --> 00:40:34,879
