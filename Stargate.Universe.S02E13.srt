1
00:00:04,085 --> 00:00:08,215
<i>I may be on the verge of discovering
the true nature ofDestiny's mission.</i>

2
00:00:09,991 --> 00:00:13,051
<i>You've had control of this ship
the whole time!</i>

3
00:00:13,128 --> 00:00:14,493
Why wouldn't you tell anyone?

4
00:00:14,562 --> 00:00:17,497
The Lucian Alliance
is planning an attack on Earth.

5
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:21,066
<i>I killed Riley.
I suffocated him with my own hands.</i>

6
00:00:21,169 --> 00:00:23,160
You are a good commander.

7
00:00:23,271 --> 00:00:26,297
<i>There is no mission other
than getting these people home.</i>

8
00:00:26,374 --> 00:00:29,537
<i>It was never about going home, it's
about getting us to where we're going.</i>

9
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:31,875
That is the mission.

10
00:00:32,647 --> 00:00:34,615
You were in detention. For good reason.

11
00:00:34,949 --> 00:00:36,348
I was just wondering
what to do about it now.

12
00:00:37,018 --> 00:00:38,280
That's not up to you.

13
00:00:40,255 --> 00:00:41,279
Take cover!

14
00:00:41,356 --> 00:00:43,415
<i>Homeworld Command
needs the intel they're providing,</i>

15
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:46,186
and it's quite possible
that these prisoners have information

16
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:47,819
that could help head off that attack.

17
00:00:47,896 --> 00:00:49,420
<i>Ginn and I figured out</i>

18
00:00:49,497 --> 00:00:52,955
<i>how to dial the ninth chevron back to
Earth while Destiny recharges in a star.</i>

19
00:00:53,134 --> 00:00:55,069
<i>Somehow,
I've come back through time.</i>

20
00:00:55,137 --> 00:00:56,832
<i>Tell them not to try and dial Earth.</i>

21
00:00:56,906 --> 00:00:58,601
<i>It won't work.
They're all going to die.</i>

22
00:00:58,674 --> 00:01:00,437
Stop trying to scare people
and get on with this.

23
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:02,306
Wait three seconds, then follow me!

24
00:01:02,378 --> 00:01:03,504
<i>The connection was made,</i>

25
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:06,013
<i>but you were the only one
who made it through to Earth.</i>

26
00:01:13,889 --> 00:01:15,288
Welcome back, David.

27
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:17,053
Everett.

28
00:01:17,393 --> 00:01:18,951
What the hell happened?

29
00:01:19,061 --> 00:01:20,619
That's gonna take some explaining.

30
00:01:21,764 --> 00:01:22,992
To the best of our knowledge,

31
00:01:23,065 --> 00:01:24,828
the connection was only viable
for a few moments,

32
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,891
which is why you were the only one
who made it through.

33
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:28,768
So where'd everyone else go?

34
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,466
The likely answer is they were simply
killed in an unstable wormhole.

35
00:01:33,976 --> 00:01:36,843
- The other me?
- He died

36
00:01:37,413 --> 00:01:41,213
<i>trying to retrieve some valuable hardware
from the other Destiny.</i>

37
00:01:41,417 --> 00:01:43,146
It was an accident.

38
00:01:45,487 --> 00:01:46,647
David?

39
00:01:48,657 --> 00:01:49,954
It's a lot to process.

40
00:01:50,326 --> 00:01:52,954
No. No, I get it.

41
00:01:54,196 --> 00:01:55,754
Sort of.

42
00:01:57,066 --> 00:02:01,002
Anyway, I've been around the program
long enough to know this stuff happens,

43
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,834
but good luck trying to explain
it to Senator Michaels.

44
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,375
New head of the off-world
spending committee?

45
00:02:07,443 --> 00:02:09,343
I've gotta head back,
but she's coming onboard.

46
00:02:09,478 --> 00:02:11,537
She'll want a post-mortem
on this latest fiasco,

47
00:02:11,614 --> 00:02:14,708
but what she's really interested
in is Rush's little signal from God...

48
00:02:14,817 --> 00:02:16,717
I never called it that.

49
00:02:16,952 --> 00:02:19,785
Well, that's what a lot of them
are calling it back home.

50
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:22,584
It's created a bit of a stir.

51
00:02:26,095 --> 00:02:27,892
They wanna know
if it's worth spending the money

52
00:02:27,963 --> 00:02:30,830
to get another Icarus base up and running.

53
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:32,059
Yeah, even if they do,

54
00:02:32,134 --> 00:02:34,534
and they find another planet
and make a connection,

55
00:02:34,603 --> 00:02:36,003
it's still only a one-way trip.

56
00:02:36,506 --> 00:02:39,873
You, me, and everyone on this ship
aren't going anywhere.

57
00:02:39,943 --> 00:02:41,342
Yeah, it'd be nice to get supplies.

58
00:02:41,478 --> 00:02:44,675
I should switch with the Senator,
talk to my people,

59
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:48,240
find out how this is all playing
with our international partners.

60
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:49,410
All right.

61
00:02:49,486 --> 00:02:51,420
We'll need a male volunteer as well.

62
00:02:51,488 --> 00:02:54,355
She's bringing a scientist with her
to confirm Rush's findings.

63
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,756
Oh, well, in that case,
I know the perfect candidate.

64
00:02:56,826 --> 00:02:57,850
Camile.

65
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,760
He's the only one onboard
who hasn't used the stones to go back.

66
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,161
He keeps turning it down.

67
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,100
Well, then maybe you should
order him to go.

68
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:08,966
He was borderline unstable
when we came onboard.

69
00:03:09,072 --> 00:03:10,300
If anyone can use some time off...

70
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,331
All right, I will make that happen.

71
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,145
This was your idea, wasn't it?

72
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,750
We don't have all day, Sergeant.

73
00:03:21,818 --> 00:03:24,480
I don't need R&R.

74
00:03:24,988 --> 00:03:27,786
Yeah. Yeah, I get it.
You're the perfect soldier.

75
00:03:27,857 --> 00:03:30,417
No rest, no weakness, no fear.

76
00:03:32,228 --> 00:03:33,991
Now, can we get this over with?

77
00:03:43,073 --> 00:03:44,540
Identify yourself.

78
00:03:45,175 --> 00:03:46,267
What's going on?

79
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,807
Identify yourself now!

80
00:03:47,877 --> 00:03:50,368
I'm Camile Wray,
this is Master Sergeant Ronald Greer.

81
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,742
Authentication code.

82
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:54,543
1-7-0-0-5-8-6.

83
00:03:56,086 --> 00:03:59,214
What is going on?
This is a scheduled connection.

84
00:03:59,589 --> 00:04:01,056
At ease, Sergeant.

85
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,418
Sorry about this, Camile.

86
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,290
Senator Michaels
and Dr. Covel were briefed,

87
00:04:05,362 --> 00:04:06,727
but there was no time to warn you.

88
00:04:06,796 --> 00:04:09,594
We are at a heightened
terrorist threat level.

89
00:04:11,634 --> 00:04:12,623
What happened?

90
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:14,127
Nothing yet,

91
00:04:14,204 --> 00:04:17,663
but intel says that the Lucian Alliance
is on the verge of launching an attack.

92
00:04:18,142 --> 00:04:20,474
Homeworld Command is the target.

93
00:04:34,558 --> 00:04:38,551
Does anyone know this guy
that they're sending to check up on us?

94
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:41,462
Supposedly, he's the new head of research
at Stargate Command.

95
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:45,467
Hovel or Shovel, something like that.

96
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:46,901
It's Covel.

97
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:49,233
Dr. Andrew Covel.

98
00:04:49,306 --> 00:04:51,103
We worked together
for a short time at Cornell

99
00:04:51,175 --> 00:04:53,405
before we were both recruited
into the program.

100
00:04:53,477 --> 00:04:54,967
<i>Rush, come in.</i>

101
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,949
<i>- Yeah, go ahead.
- Our guests have arrived.</i>

102
00:05:01,886 --> 00:05:03,649
Yeah, I'm on my way.

103
00:05:10,127 --> 00:05:13,062
So, what's he like?

104
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:16,332
I didn't know him that well, actually.

105
00:05:16,634 --> 00:05:18,329
But you said you worked with him.

106
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:21,101
Yeah, well, what can I tell you?

107
00:05:21,705 --> 00:05:24,765
He's the type of man
who likes to keep secrets.

108
00:05:27,044 --> 00:05:29,103
Yeah, we know the type.

109
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,247
Incredible.

110
00:05:33,317 --> 00:05:35,683
The design predates
any Ancient technology we've seen

111
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:36,879
in the Milky Way or Pegasus.

112
00:05:36,954 --> 00:05:40,151
Well, it's a pretty big ship.
Anywhere in particular you'd like to start?

113
00:05:40,224 --> 00:05:43,057
I'd like to start by clearing something up.

114
00:05:43,394 --> 00:05:46,522
Given recent events,
I would like to know once and for all

115
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:50,158
if we're closing the book on the
feasibility of dialing within a star.

116
00:05:50,568 --> 00:05:53,128
I'm not the man
you should be asking.

117
00:05:53,204 --> 00:05:54,933
Your first order of business

118
00:05:55,005 --> 00:05:56,939
was supposed to be
to get these people home.

119
00:05:57,007 --> 00:05:59,169
Presumably without killing them.

120
00:05:59,277 --> 00:06:01,609
If I'm not mistaken,
all of our people signed off on it.

121
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,741
Numbers were good, but it's true,
conditions inside a star are unpredictable.

122
00:06:06,218 --> 00:06:08,812
<i>It's just unfortunate that
the other Destiny was lost</i>

123
00:06:08,887 --> 00:06:11,185
before anyone had a chance
to go over the logs.

124
00:06:11,323 --> 00:06:14,315
We needed those spare parts.
There wasn't a lot of time.

125
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:15,619
That's understandable.

126
00:06:16,127 --> 00:06:19,221
Unfortunately, it means
we have no idea what really happened.

127
00:06:19,297 --> 00:06:21,857
You're assuming
the other Rush was lying.

128
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:26,063
My impressions of the man, Colonel,
are based entirely on your reports.

129
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:27,297
We've had our differences,

130
00:06:27,372 --> 00:06:29,932
but this time I was prepared
to support him, stay behind,

131
00:06:30,008 --> 00:06:32,806
as long as we had enough volunteers
to keep the mission going.

132
00:06:32,878 --> 00:06:34,072
Sorry I'm late.

133
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:36,079
Problems with power
distribution, as usual.

134
00:06:36,214 --> 00:06:39,775
Dr. Rush, Senator Michaels.
I believe you know Dr. Covel.

135
00:06:40,285 --> 00:06:42,446
- Andrew.
- Nicholas, good to see you.

136
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:44,816
So, what are we talking about?

137
00:06:46,925 --> 00:06:50,258
I was just telling Colonel Young
how I would like to see Chloe.

138
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:52,125
I was very good friends with her father,

139
00:06:52,197 --> 00:06:54,825
and I've know her
since she was a little girl.

140
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,698
Sure. She's on the bridge.
I'll take you to her.

141
00:07:07,012 --> 00:07:09,105
Is that what I think it is?

142
00:07:09,414 --> 00:07:11,712
We're sweeping the building for radiation.

143
00:07:11,883 --> 00:07:13,783
The Alliance has managed to infiltrate

144
00:07:13,852 --> 00:07:16,514
a couple of our off-world bases
and plant naquadria bombs.

145
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:19,814
All clear, sir.

146
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,256
- Thank you. Carry on.
- Yes, sir.

147
00:07:23,094 --> 00:07:25,153
We have escorts waiting
for both of you outside.

148
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,595
They'll take you wherever you need to go.

149
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:28,826
All due respect, sir,
with everything going on,

150
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,425
I think I'd like to stay right here.

151
00:07:32,003 --> 00:07:33,868
Appreciate the thought,
Master Sergeant, but we've got this.

152
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:36,207
Look, I know these people, Colonel.

153
00:07:36,675 --> 00:07:38,142
I've dealt with them.

154
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:42,169
Unlike some of us, I never trusted them.

155
00:07:43,082 --> 00:07:46,313
I'll keep that under advisement,
but for now, you're dismissed.

156
00:07:47,954 --> 00:07:49,216
Yes, sir.

157
00:08:05,171 --> 00:08:06,263
Nice.

158
00:08:13,145 --> 00:08:14,305
Chloe?

159
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,013
Senator Michaels, is it you?

160
00:08:20,286 --> 00:08:22,254
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

161
00:08:22,788 --> 00:08:24,312
Hi, sweetheart.

162
00:08:26,092 --> 00:08:30,119
<i>- Look at you.
Wow, welcome to the Destiny.</i>

163
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:31,694
I can't believe it.

164
00:08:32,565 --> 00:08:33,725
Well, what are you doing?

165
00:08:33,933 --> 00:08:37,198
Oh, I was just going over
the ship's FTL jump logs.

166
00:08:37,937 --> 00:08:40,371
We're trying to improve the accuracy
of manual navigation.

167
00:08:40,439 --> 00:08:42,771
- Really?
- It's the new me.

168
00:08:42,842 --> 00:08:43,968
What do you think?

169
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:48,673
Well, I think I'd like to leave
the science and technology

170
00:08:48,748 --> 00:08:52,809
to somebody else for a few moments
so we can talk, if that's okay with you?

171
00:08:53,185 --> 00:08:54,982
Go ahead, Chloe. You can finish this later.

172
00:08:57,189 --> 00:09:00,022
- Great, come on. I'll show you around.
- All right.

173
00:09:00,926 --> 00:09:04,919
Well, I have to say, Nicholas,
I'm impressed.

174
00:09:04,997 --> 00:09:07,488
I think I'm starting to understand
the passion you had for this mission

175
00:09:07,566 --> 00:09:10,000
even before you found a signal.

176
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,062
Congratulations.

177
00:09:15,741 --> 00:09:16,833
Yeah.

178
00:09:22,315 --> 00:09:23,680
Master Sergeant, wait!

179
00:09:23,817 --> 00:09:25,478
- I'm off duty, right?
- Yes.

180
00:09:25,719 --> 00:09:26,947
Then I don't have to talk to you.

181
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,352
You know, if you go into this
assuming it's a waste of time,

182
00:09:29,423 --> 00:09:30,481
it probably will be.

183
00:09:32,025 --> 00:09:35,483
Do you have any idea
what's going on here?

184
00:09:35,729 --> 00:09:38,323
We've known about the Lucian Alliance
threat for a long time.

185
00:09:38,465 --> 00:09:41,434
And too bad we didn't do
anything about it.

186
00:09:41,501 --> 00:09:43,059
I did do something about it.

187
00:09:43,136 --> 00:09:45,798
Those prisoners gave us
valuable intelligence.

188
00:09:45,872 --> 00:09:47,840
Maybe they were just feeding us a line

189
00:09:47,908 --> 00:09:52,368
while we gave them food and shelter
and put our own people at risk!

190
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:54,344
You don't know what...

191
00:09:54,815 --> 00:09:55,941
What's happening?

192
00:09:56,216 --> 00:09:57,274
That's incoming.

193
00:09:58,485 --> 00:09:59,713
- No, no...
- What are you doing?

194
00:09:59,786 --> 00:10:01,549
- We have to go...
- Let go of me! Where?

195
00:10:01,822 --> 00:10:04,017
No, we've got to get out of here!

196
00:10:12,132 --> 00:10:14,362
<i>I don't
know how you do it.</i>

197
00:10:14,601 --> 00:10:18,697
I would have gone crazy in two weeks
locked up in a place like this,

198
00:10:18,772 --> 00:10:20,000
let alone a whole year.

199
00:10:20,107 --> 00:10:23,907
It's not like we never get outside.
We gate to planets all the time.

200
00:10:24,845 --> 00:10:26,403
I spoke to your mom the other day.

201
00:10:28,381 --> 00:10:29,473
How's she doing?

202
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:34,951
She's holding up, you know,
it's not easy, but she's holding up.

203
00:10:37,524 --> 00:10:40,516
I'm so sorry, Chloe.
We should've gotten you home long ago.

204
00:10:41,728 --> 00:10:43,355
It's not just me.

205
00:10:44,498 --> 00:10:45,965
Look,

206
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:52,933
everyone else on this ship,
with the exception of Mr. Wallace,

207
00:10:53,006 --> 00:10:54,871
is a member of Stargate Command.

208
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:58,139
Yeah, that doesn't mean
they signed up for this.

209
00:10:58,578 --> 00:10:59,909
Maybe not,

210
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,476
but it does mean that, sooner or later,

211
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,848
they were gonna wind up
on some obscure planet,

212
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:07,353
doing God knows what kind of research,

213
00:11:07,421 --> 00:11:11,221
that may or may not ever have seen
the light of day on Earth.

214
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,484
Now, don't get me wrong,

215
00:11:13,594 --> 00:11:15,926
I realize the potential of all of that,

216
00:11:17,398 --> 00:11:21,562
but I never once thought that
that life was for you.

217
00:11:23,137 --> 00:11:25,401
Your father had such plans.

218
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,775
Now you're stuck here.

219
00:11:31,112 --> 00:11:34,673
I'm sorry, it just seems like such a waste.

220
00:11:41,722 --> 00:11:44,122
Colonel, you all right?

221
00:11:44,425 --> 00:11:46,586
- Yeah, I think so. What happened?
- We don't know yet.

222
00:11:46,761 --> 00:11:48,729
We're still getting damage reports.

223
00:11:48,796 --> 00:11:50,593
All right, keep moving, let's go, folks!

224
00:12:03,177 --> 00:12:04,576
Oh, God.

225
00:12:07,381 --> 00:12:10,111
Greer! Oh, God.

226
00:12:11,686 --> 00:12:13,381
Greer! Greer!

227
00:12:19,694 --> 00:12:20,922
Hey.

228
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,860
- You all right?
- What happened?

229
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:27,728
I don't know. It sounded like an explosion.

230
00:12:28,502 --> 00:12:30,094
Lucian Alliance.

231
00:12:31,239 --> 00:12:32,706
Watch your head.

232
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,999
You're bleeding.

233
00:12:35,343 --> 00:12:36,810
We got to find out what's going on.

234
00:12:36,878 --> 00:12:39,438
Oh, no. No, I don't think
you should be moving.

235
00:12:42,584 --> 00:12:44,711
- What is it?
- My knee.

236
00:12:46,221 --> 00:12:48,189
It's twisted pretty bad.

237
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,752
Oh, now what?

238
00:13:15,217 --> 00:13:18,675
Looks like the explosion,
or whatever it was,

239
00:13:18,754 --> 00:13:22,281
might have weakened
the structure of the building.

240
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,053
You still wanna stay here?

241
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:28,721
Give me a second.

242
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,680
This might hurt a bit.

243
00:13:54,189 --> 00:13:55,281
Okay.

244
00:14:01,763 --> 00:14:03,958
- Is that too tight?
- No, that's good.

245
00:14:04,032 --> 00:14:05,124
Okay.

246
00:14:05,767 --> 00:14:06,893
All right.

247
00:14:08,236 --> 00:14:09,328
You ready to do this?

248
00:14:10,605 --> 00:14:12,072
Let's get the hell out of here.

249
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,137
I got it.

250
00:14:22,384 --> 00:14:23,409
Well?

251
00:14:25,154 --> 00:14:29,056
I think I'm listening to a recording
that's over a million years old,

252
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,923
captured with technology I can't imagine,

253
00:14:32,295 --> 00:14:35,731
processed and filtered using algorithms
I don't even understand.

254
00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:39,024
- But you can see the structure?
- Yes.

255
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,331
I'm just not quite sure I believe it.

256
00:14:47,543 --> 00:14:49,067
Listen, listen.

257
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,914
I'll admit, there's a lot
of impressive data here

258
00:14:52,982 --> 00:14:55,382
and if I could transmit
it all back to Earth

259
00:14:55,451 --> 00:14:58,113
and get 20 of our best people
working on this for the next five years,

260
00:14:58,187 --> 00:14:59,745
maybe, maybe I could confirm it.

261
00:14:59,822 --> 00:15:02,723
I can't do that. I mean, with the stones,
it's basically word of mouth.

262
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:05,256
I have to make a judgment call here.

263
00:15:05,328 --> 00:15:07,228
Do you have any idea what kind
of a position that puts me in?

264
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:10,595
I know that you were offered Icarus
before they gave it to me,

265
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:13,461
and I know you turned it down.
You couldn't see the potential.

266
00:15:13,803 --> 00:15:16,795
I thought it was a bunch of mythological
mumbo-jumbo about the gods

267
00:15:16,873 --> 00:15:18,033
and ultimate understanding.

268
00:15:18,107 --> 00:15:19,540
Yeah, well, this proves you wrong.

269
00:15:19,609 --> 00:15:22,043
We are talking about
evidence of an intelligence

270
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,079
- present at the beginning of time.
- Yeah.

271
00:15:24,147 --> 00:15:25,239
Now, you can deny it all you like,

272
00:15:25,314 --> 00:15:27,748
they're gonna call it proof
of the existence of God,

273
00:15:27,917 --> 00:15:31,409
and for every politician that tries
to take that and bend it for his own ends,

274
00:15:31,487 --> 00:15:34,081
there's gonna be just as many,
maybe more, who try to bury it, Nick.

275
00:15:34,157 --> 00:15:35,852
They'll try to bury it,
and you along with it...

276
00:15:35,925 --> 00:15:38,189
So, what are you saying, Andrew?
What are you trying to tell me?

277
00:15:38,261 --> 00:15:39,285
You don't want to pick a side

278
00:15:39,362 --> 00:15:40,727
because you're not sure
which one's gonna win?

279
00:15:42,065 --> 00:15:43,896
Same old Nick.

280
00:15:44,834 --> 00:15:46,961
You never make things easy, do you?

281
00:15:54,377 --> 00:15:55,366
Got it.

282
00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:03,946
You hear that?

283
00:16:04,354 --> 00:16:05,378
There.

284
00:16:08,292 --> 00:16:09,452
Hello?

285
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,259
You all right?

286
00:16:21,038 --> 00:16:25,236
Yeah. I think so.

287
00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:26,776
I've gotta get out of this place.

288
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,502
Yeah, don't worry,
we'll get you out of here.

289
00:16:32,249 --> 00:16:33,910
Radio. Radio.

290
00:16:34,351 --> 00:16:36,478
It's coming from somewhere back there.

291
00:16:38,422 --> 00:16:39,616
I don't have time for this.

292
00:16:39,823 --> 00:16:42,087
- I gotta get out of here now.
- Maintain, Airman.

293
00:16:42,392 --> 00:16:44,826
- We're doing the best we can.
We've got another one.

294
00:16:49,032 --> 00:16:50,056
He's dead.

295
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,462
See if he has a gun.

296
00:16:51,702 --> 00:16:52,862
What do you need a gun for?

297
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,060
We're still trying
to figure out what happened.

298
00:16:55,939 --> 00:16:57,201
We need to be prepared for whatever.

299
00:17:04,414 --> 00:17:06,939
<i>This is Camile Wray
in Homeworld Command.</i>

300
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,143
<i>Can anybody read this?</i>

301
00:17:09,219 --> 00:17:10,311
Camile, is that you?

302
00:17:10,587 --> 00:17:13,112
David? Yes.

303
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:16,990
I'm here with Greer
and another survivor, Airman Evans.

304
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,160
<i>What happened?</i>

305
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,492
There's been an attack.

306
00:17:21,565 --> 00:17:24,295
A cloaked Alliance cargo ship
was detected on approach.

307
00:17:24,368 --> 00:17:26,802
It crashed into the building
on the inner north side.

308
00:17:27,538 --> 00:17:29,096
But that's near the comm lab.

309
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:32,040
If the stones were hit,
we shouldn't be here.

310
00:17:32,109 --> 00:17:33,872
<i>That's affirmative.
They must still be connected.</i>

311
00:17:33,944 --> 00:17:35,809
Sergeant, get on that.

312
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,747
Look, Camile, I've been talking
with our intelligence people.

313
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,941
They all agree.

314
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,986
There's no way a lone cargo ship would
try an attack on Homeworld Command

315
00:17:43,053 --> 00:17:44,646
<i>without packing a little
something extra.</i>

316
00:17:45,823 --> 00:17:47,085
Like what, exactly?

317
00:17:47,492 --> 00:17:50,188
We think there might be a bomb onboard,
as yet unexploded.

318
00:17:50,261 --> 00:17:52,786
You have to get the hell out of there.

319
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,961
- Stop it, will you?
- No, no, it's true.

320
00:17:58,169 --> 00:18:00,034
Look, I'm telling you.

321
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:02,762
And in here, we have our infirmary.

322
00:18:03,074 --> 00:18:04,541
Hey, Colonel.

323
00:18:05,076 --> 00:18:07,544
Lieutenant Johansen,
this is Senator Michaels.

324
00:18:07,912 --> 00:18:09,470
We're giving her the tour.

325
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:10,571
She's here to...

326
00:18:10,648 --> 00:18:14,414
I'm here to assess the potential
and long-term viability of this mission.

327
00:18:14,953 --> 00:18:19,390
And this is Varro,
one of our remaining Alliance guests.

328
00:18:19,524 --> 00:18:21,048
Yes, I know.

329
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:24,253
He's been helping me out
volunteering down here.

330
00:18:24,596 --> 00:18:26,894
He's actually got a pretty good
understanding of first aid.

331
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:29,666
Just trying to keep myself useful.

332
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:32,794
Well, if you don't mind,

333
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,395
I have a few things I would like
to discuss with the Lieutenant.

334
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,905
Of course.

335
00:18:44,382 --> 00:18:48,409
Look, I know you've been
under a lot of pressure,

336
00:18:49,554 --> 00:18:54,856
trying to keep all these people alive
in some pretty difficult circumstances.

337
00:18:55,793 --> 00:18:57,420
Well, it hasn't been easy,

338
00:18:57,528 --> 00:18:59,291
but things have been looking up

339
00:18:59,364 --> 00:19:02,265
since we got our hands
on the full Ancient database.

340
00:19:02,367 --> 00:19:04,301
There's some advanced
medical knowledge,

341
00:19:04,369 --> 00:19:06,030
and I'm starting to get
a better understanding

342
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:08,072
of how some of their equipment works.

343
00:19:08,139 --> 00:19:09,970
Well, it must be a lot to digest,

344
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:13,875
especially for someone
with only a medic's training.

345
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,071
No offense.

346
00:19:16,047 --> 00:19:17,537
None taken.

347
00:19:17,915 --> 00:19:19,974
Look, if you're trying
to say we'd be better off

348
00:19:20,051 --> 00:19:22,019
with a real doctor onboard, you're right.

349
00:19:22,887 --> 00:19:25,721
I just don't think you're gonna get
a whole lot of eager volunteers.

350
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:26,985
Really? Why's that?

351
00:19:27,926 --> 00:19:30,292
Knowing that there's a chance
that they'll never go home.

352
00:19:36,135 --> 00:19:37,363
Oh, man.

353
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:40,699
This doesn't look good.

354
00:19:40,773 --> 00:19:42,001
Are you sure this is the way out?

355
00:19:42,074 --> 00:19:44,508
Well, it's the way
to what was the nearest exit.

356
00:19:46,578 --> 00:19:48,443
<i>David, this is Camile.</i>

357
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:50,740
Go ahead.

358
00:19:50,949 --> 00:19:52,917
Looks like our nearest way out is blocked.

359
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:54,919
How's it coming with
that bomb disposal unit?

360
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,351
<i>So far, not so good.</i>

361
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:58,422
There's a lot of debris,
they can't dig through it.

362
00:19:58,724 --> 00:20:00,157
<i>We've got heavier
equipment on the way,</i>

363
00:20:00,225 --> 00:20:01,988
<i>but by the time they get here...</i>

364
00:20:04,263 --> 00:20:05,753
I don't know.

365
00:20:06,231 --> 00:20:07,892
What kind of bomb are we talking about?

366
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,432
<i>Intelligence suggests it's
a weapons-grade naquadria device</i>

367
00:20:10,536 --> 00:20:13,027
with a probable yield
of 50 to 70 megatons.

368
00:20:13,639 --> 00:20:16,233
<i>We've already started evacuations.</i>

369
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:21,411
All right, well, if you can't get in,
and we can't get out,

370
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:26,176
then maybe the best plan
is for us to go for the bomb.

371
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:27,951
What?

372
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:32,252
You said impact was on
the inner north side, near the comm lab?

373
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:34,086
We shouldn't be too far.

374
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,059
You don't know anything
about defusing bombs!

375
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:37,594
You can talk us through it.

376
00:20:37,763 --> 00:20:40,288
No, I cannot allow you
to volunteer for something like this.

377
00:20:40,366 --> 00:20:41,697
You're not even in your own bodies!

378
00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:44,535
If that bomb goes off,
these bodies will die

379
00:20:44,603 --> 00:20:48,039
along with everyone else,
and if we're still connected,

380
00:20:48,107 --> 00:20:49,335
it'll kill us too.

381
00:20:49,408 --> 00:20:50,773
It's not much of a choice.

382
00:21:01,086 --> 00:21:02,314
Eli Wallace.

383
00:21:03,288 --> 00:21:04,346
Yeah?

384
00:21:04,423 --> 00:21:06,585
Nick's famous young protégé.
A pleasure to finally meet you.

385
00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:09,492
- I'm Dr. Andrew Covel.
- Right. Nice to meet you.

386
00:21:10,964 --> 00:21:13,194
People back at Stargate Command
call you the Boy Wonder.

387
00:21:16,336 --> 00:21:19,237
Does that make Rush my Batman?

388
00:21:21,307 --> 00:21:22,467
Guess not.

389
00:21:25,412 --> 00:21:27,778
- Adam Brody.
- Dale Volker.

390
00:21:29,382 --> 00:21:30,872
We work here too.

391
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,247
Good.

392
00:21:32,886 --> 00:21:34,046
Maybe you can help me.

393
00:21:36,356 --> 00:21:37,516
What can we do for you?

394
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,080
Well, I just wanna know what you think.

395
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:40,519
About?

396
00:21:41,161 --> 00:21:44,187
Everything. This ship, your role in it.

397
00:21:45,231 --> 00:21:46,698
Nick's little discovery.

398
00:22:01,915 --> 00:22:04,406
- Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm okay.

399
00:22:05,718 --> 00:22:08,585
Maybe we should rest for a minute.
I can hardly breathe.

400
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:12,019
It's the dust. It's in your lungs already.

401
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:16,187
We don't stop. We keep going.

402
00:22:16,262 --> 00:22:21,029
Greer, Greer, can you just this once
not pretend to be invincible?

403
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,728
Can you just this once stop talking?

404
00:22:24,204 --> 00:22:27,469
- What is your problem?
- You really wanna know?

405
00:22:27,707 --> 00:22:30,039
- Yeah, I really wanna know.
- We're really going to do this now?

406
00:22:30,109 --> 00:22:32,600
My problem is people like you.

407
00:22:32,879 --> 00:22:37,339
People who talk and talk,
and meanwhile, nothing gets done!

408
00:22:37,484 --> 00:22:38,644
No, no, that's not it.

409
00:22:38,852 --> 00:22:40,649
So now you're gonna tell me
something about me?

410
00:22:40,753 --> 00:22:42,744
- I know you.
- You know a file in a desk!

411
00:22:45,191 --> 00:22:46,317
You don't know anything.

412
00:22:46,392 --> 00:22:49,055
- You're afraid of me!
- Do you hear something?

413
00:22:49,363 --> 00:22:52,628
You're afraid of what I do
because I help people with their problems,

414
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,063
but I can't do it unless they admit
that they have problems in the first place,

415
00:22:56,136 --> 00:22:57,535
and that's just somewhere you won't go!

416
00:22:57,605 --> 00:23:00,096
You need to just think
you make a difference,

417
00:23:00,174 --> 00:23:02,938
- instead of just taking up space...
- Shut up for a minute.

418
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,407
You're afraid that if you
look inside yourself for even one second,

419
00:23:07,047 --> 00:23:08,776
you might find out
that you're not invincible,

420
00:23:08,849 --> 00:23:10,783
that you're just as scared
and vulnerable as the rest of us...

421
00:23:10,851 --> 00:23:11,840
I said shut up!

422
00:23:13,721 --> 00:23:15,018
I can hear something.

423
00:23:17,525 --> 00:23:18,719
It's coming from over here.

424
00:23:19,293 --> 00:23:20,692
What is it?

425
00:23:20,861 --> 00:23:21,919
It's the Geiger counter.

426
00:23:22,763 --> 00:23:24,754
The tech who was sweeping the building.

427
00:23:28,602 --> 00:23:31,400
There he is. Hey! Can you hear us?

428
00:23:31,572 --> 00:23:32,630
We're gonna get you out.

429
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:35,303
Oh, God!

430
00:23:38,846 --> 00:23:42,509
You're okay. You're okay. It's okay.
Just breathe.

431
00:23:53,994 --> 00:23:55,154
That doesn't sound good.

432
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:58,023
I don't know. I can't read this thing.

433
00:23:58,365 --> 00:24:00,128
Here, give it to me.

434
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:13,940
This area is flooded with radiation.

435
00:24:14,415 --> 00:24:17,145
It could be from the crashed ship,
or from the bomb itself,

436
00:24:17,217 --> 00:24:18,775
but these are deadly levels.

437
00:24:19,286 --> 00:24:23,279
What you're saying is if we stay here
much longer, we could die.

438
00:24:23,557 --> 00:24:27,323
No. I'm saying we're dead already.

439
00:24:29,864 --> 00:24:31,058
So, what's the verdict?

440
00:24:32,968 --> 00:24:34,902
Well, I've hardly
completed my assessment,

441
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:37,632
but I do have some concerns.

442
00:24:37,906 --> 00:24:39,134
Such as?

443
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:43,776
Well, you know how long it took to get
the first Icarus base up and running.

444
00:24:43,845 --> 00:24:46,006
Even if I were to get
presidential approval tomorrow,

445
00:24:46,314 --> 00:24:49,147
and we were to find a planet immediately,

446
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:52,742
it'd still take another six months
before we're ready to do a dial-out.

447
00:24:54,289 --> 00:24:55,688
And?

448
00:24:55,757 --> 00:24:57,054
To be perfectly blunt,

449
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:58,820
we're not sure
you're gonna survive that long.

450
00:24:59,294 --> 00:25:01,956
<i>And more importantly, we're not sure
Destiny's gonna survive.</i>

451
00:25:02,163 --> 00:25:04,188
Well, we've managed
to hold it together so far.

452
00:25:04,366 --> 00:25:06,857
What, are you kidding me?
You're the problem here.

453
00:25:07,168 --> 00:25:08,601
Since you and your people came onboard,

454
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,661
you've brought this ship
to the brink of destruction repeatedly.

455
00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:12,502
It's a wonder this thing's flying at all.

456
00:25:12,674 --> 00:25:15,108
<i>Colonel, this is Brody.
We're about to drop out of FTL.</i>

457
00:25:16,177 --> 00:25:18,702
That's understood. Heads up.

458
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,180
The connection's going to be
interrupted for a few seconds.

459
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:26,514
These bodies. We did this to them.

460
00:25:27,989 --> 00:25:31,618
There was no way to know.
It was the right call.

461
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:35,227
If we leave now, get out as fast as we can,
we might still be okay.

462
00:25:35,296 --> 00:25:38,857
I'm sorry, Airman, I really am,
but we've already had lethal exposure.

463
00:25:39,067 --> 00:25:40,932
You can't know that!
You're not a scientist!

464
00:25:42,437 --> 00:25:45,565
Maybe not, but I've worked with enough
of them to pick up a few things.

465
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:56,141
What the hell's going on?

466
00:25:56,217 --> 00:25:58,344
What is this? What's happening?

467
00:25:58,453 --> 00:26:00,683
Let me see that. In your hand.

468
00:26:04,859 --> 00:26:06,224
- Colonel.
- We just dropped out.

469
00:26:06,294 --> 00:26:08,421
There's been an attack. Lucian Alliance.

470
00:26:08,496 --> 00:26:10,761
There's a bomb,
naquadria, radiation leaking.

471
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:12,232
We're trying to get to it, but...

472
00:26:14,303 --> 00:26:15,395
Senator?

473
00:26:16,305 --> 00:26:19,331
Oh, my God. Homeworld Command.

474
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,878
- What happened?
- The connection was interrupted.

475
00:26:24,513 --> 00:26:26,378
You think they got the gist
of what I was trying to say?

476
00:26:26,716 --> 00:26:29,150
If he didn't, the other
two can fill them in.

477
00:26:29,218 --> 00:26:30,685
They've seen it for themselves now.

478
00:26:33,889 --> 00:26:35,015
Evans, what the hell?

479
00:26:35,091 --> 00:26:38,356
Put the gun down.
Put it down now or I'll kill her!

480
00:26:41,297 --> 00:26:43,561
Are we sure this is a good idea?

481
00:26:43,632 --> 00:26:45,532
I mean, your people
are already on the ground.

482
00:26:45,601 --> 00:26:47,694
They know the situation.
We could just make things worse.

483
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,101
We won't wipe the stones.

484
00:26:49,171 --> 00:26:51,537
We'll just disconnect long enough
to get a full report.

485
00:26:51,707 --> 00:26:54,039
Then we will bring you back
and let you know what's happening.

486
00:26:54,443 --> 00:26:55,740
Go ahead.

487
00:27:01,617 --> 00:27:02,914
Nothing happened.

488
00:27:03,385 --> 00:27:04,579
Shut the device off.

489
00:27:09,492 --> 00:27:10,754
We're still here.

490
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:17,759
- Airman, what the hell are you doing?
- I'm not gonna die in here!

491
00:27:17,833 --> 00:27:20,199
We're gonna turn around
and find another way out!

492
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,428
You're freaking out.

493
00:27:22,805 --> 00:27:26,070
I understand, but this isn't gonna help.

494
00:27:26,142 --> 00:27:29,441
Shoot him. Even if he kills me,
you can still get to the bomb.

495
00:27:29,845 --> 00:27:31,005
- Camile.
- It's an act!

496
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,145
If you give him the gun,
he'll kill us both.

497
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:35,742
He's Lucian Alliance.

498
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:54,102
You're sure he was one of them?

499
00:27:54,371 --> 00:27:56,305
There was something wrong
about him from the start,

500
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,241
and he knew I wasn't a scientist,
but I never told him that.

501
00:28:01,378 --> 00:28:02,902
All he knew was my name.

502
00:28:04,648 --> 00:28:07,708
Telford gave them files on all of us.

503
00:28:10,887 --> 00:28:12,354
Clan tattoo.

504
00:28:13,089 --> 00:28:14,283
He was probably the pilot.

505
00:28:14,658 --> 00:28:16,523
Think there's any more like him
around here?

506
00:28:17,227 --> 00:28:18,421
No, I doubt it.

507
00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:23,561
I mean, my guess is that
the plan was to land the ship cloaked

508
00:28:23,633 --> 00:28:26,830
on the roof or somewhere nearby,
and then just walk away.

509
00:28:28,939 --> 00:28:30,065
Nice catch.

510
00:28:39,883 --> 00:28:41,111
The radiation's spiking.

511
00:28:41,785 --> 00:28:43,252
I think we're getting close.

512
00:28:46,389 --> 00:28:47,549
Can we make it through?

513
00:28:50,594 --> 00:28:54,963
Yeah, I think we can make it through here.
We'll have to crawl, though.

514
00:28:56,032 --> 00:28:57,158
Sorry.

515
00:28:58,935 --> 00:29:01,267
No, don't worry about me.

516
00:29:03,707 --> 00:29:04,833
Right.

517
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,499
Well?

518
00:29:09,145 --> 00:29:10,908
It's interesting.

519
00:29:12,249 --> 00:29:13,341
This shouldn't be happening.

520
00:29:13,817 --> 00:29:17,014
- What do you mean?
- The stones work in pairs, they're linked.

521
00:29:17,087 --> 00:29:19,055
In order for a connection to be shut off,

522
00:29:19,122 --> 00:29:20,817
the command has to be
received at both ends.

523
00:29:20,891 --> 00:29:22,791
We've seen radiation
cut the signal off before.

524
00:29:22,893 --> 00:29:24,952
Yes, but in this case,
the transfer's still in place,

525
00:29:25,028 --> 00:29:26,757
which means the signal
must be getting through.

526
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:30,027
The radiation must only be affecting
command protocols, nothing else.

527
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,726
There may be a way to boost that
specific portion of the signal,

528
00:29:32,803 --> 00:29:35,636
or alter it in order
to get it past the interference.

529
00:29:35,773 --> 00:29:38,867
I've done a fair amount of research
in this technology. I can help.

530
00:29:38,976 --> 00:29:40,170
Colonel.

531
00:29:40,244 --> 00:29:42,576
Varro would like to speak with you.

532
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:45,713
Tamara told me what happened.

533
00:29:45,783 --> 00:29:48,911
I realize I'm probably the last person
you wanna talk to right now,

534
00:29:48,986 --> 00:29:50,351
but I think I can help.

535
00:29:50,554 --> 00:29:51,680
How?

536
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:54,816
I can tell you how to defuse that bomb.

537
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:01,194
I see the hull of the ship.
We're almost there.

538
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,309
Here, watch your head.

539
00:30:27,925 --> 00:30:29,290
Is that it?

540
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,531
Yeah. It's the source of the radiation.

541
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:43,237
David, this is Camile.
I think we found our bomb.

542
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:46,934
David, come in?

543
00:30:54,318 --> 00:30:57,048
This is Camile Wray.
Is anybody reading this?

544
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,552
Too much interference.

545
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:03,589
So much for plan A.

546
00:31:04,428 --> 00:31:07,591
We're gonna have to do this on our own.

547
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:12,025
The Alliance uses a pretty simple
design for its naquadria bombs.

548
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:14,629
The tricky part is,
it'll be protected by a hologram shell,

549
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,607
so whoever disarms it
will have to do so by feel.

550
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:21,072
The trigger wire is a slightly
thinner gauge, probably threaded.

551
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:22,713
It's the only way to distinguish it.

552
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,314
How do we know
any of what you're saying is true?

553
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:26,378
I've worked with these devices before.

554
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:27,918
That's not what I meant.

555
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:34,019
I didn't know about the attack, Colonel.
If I did, I would have warned you.

556
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:37,389
- Sir, I think he's telling the truth.
- Oh, I know you do.

557
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:44,259
Well, it won't matter anyway if Rush
can't get those stones to disconnect.

558
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:46,770
Maybe not. If it really is this simple,

559
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:48,703
maybe it's something
that can be explained quickly,

560
00:31:48,774 --> 00:31:50,332
like, say, in a few seconds?

561
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:51,737
An FTL jump.

562
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:54,602
We deliberately interrupt the connection.

563
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,608
We can't do that. We just dropped out.

564
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:58,376
We jump this soon,
we're gonna damage the engines.

565
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,844
Catastrophic, or is it
something we can live with?

566
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,752
Something we can live with, I think,

567
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:06,485
but it would be a one-shot deal.

568
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:08,458
Once we're back in FTL,
if we force an early drop,

569
00:32:08,527 --> 00:32:10,495
we're gonna blow the engines completely.

570
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:12,723
We're talking about 10,
maybe 12 seconds at the most.

571
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:14,625
What do you think, enough time?

572
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:17,631
Yeah, I think I can get the message across.

573
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:24,131
It must be on a timer.

574
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:28,138
The pilot probably wanted to give himself
a chance to get to a safe distance.

575
00:32:28,814 --> 00:32:30,111
How long?

576
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:34,079
No way to know for sure,
but it's been a while since the crash.

577
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,846
- So it could go off any second.
- Yeah.

578
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:40,050
It's possible that it was damaged,
and it's not gonna go off at all.

579
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:42,422
Or it could go off any second.

580
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,293
I'm gonna try something.

581
00:32:55,374 --> 00:32:57,171
I think it's some kind of hologram.

582
00:33:11,757 --> 00:33:14,282
The bomb's underneath. I can feel it.

583
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,730
We're gonna have to do this blind.

584
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,562
Do what, exactly?

585
00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:25,967
I haven't quite figured that part out yet.

586
00:33:30,343 --> 00:33:32,311
Senator, there you are.

587
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:37,013
We need you.
We're going to try and force an FTL jump.

588
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:40,051
Yes, I know, based on the word
of some Alliance soldier.

589
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:42,950
Look, I'm not sure we have a lot of choice.

590
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:44,215
I shouldn't even be here.

591
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:45,980
You know, I had people
on my own committee

592
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:47,423
telling me this was a waste of time,

593
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:49,984
that our only priority
should be the Alliance threat,

594
00:33:50,463 --> 00:33:51,623
and I didn't listen to them.

595
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:55,030
Look, I know you're worried
about people back home.

596
00:33:55,101 --> 00:33:58,559
<i>I am too, but you're wrong
about Destiny.</i>

597
00:34:00,473 --> 00:34:02,407
You know, the other Rush
said that in his timeline

598
00:34:02,475 --> 00:34:04,739
I was one of the people
who volunteered to stay.

599
00:34:04,911 --> 00:34:07,903
And you really think
you would have done that?

600
00:34:09,782 --> 00:34:13,775
My father died so that we could all go on.

601
00:34:13,853 --> 00:34:15,912
I have to believe that it was for a reason.

602
00:34:16,355 --> 00:34:18,721
I feel like I'm part of something here.

603
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:20,616
Something important.

604
00:34:24,664 --> 00:34:31,035
Okay, there's a large cylindrical piece,
and some kind of gasket on the end.

605
00:34:32,772 --> 00:34:34,103
Oh.

606
00:34:34,173 --> 00:34:37,302
And there's a lot of wires. I don't know!

607
00:34:37,377 --> 00:34:40,904
I mean, I could start
pulling at things randomly, but...

608
00:34:43,617 --> 00:34:47,951
Listen. Outer shell is holographic.
Inside crown is panel, remove with pin.

609
00:34:48,021 --> 00:34:50,387
The trigger wire is slightly thinner,
threaded, coarse.

610
00:34:50,457 --> 00:34:51,890
Don't pull the wire, it will detonate.

611
00:34:52,392 --> 00:34:54,451
Pop the linchpin
by applying pressure to the base, and...

612
00:34:57,364 --> 00:35:00,060
A pin. A pin, we need a pin.

613
00:35:01,368 --> 00:35:02,392
I got one.

614
00:35:04,504 --> 00:35:06,802
What happened? Did they understand it?

615
00:35:06,974 --> 00:35:08,236
I don't know.

616
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:11,100
<i>Colonel Young, this is
Rush in the communications lab.</i>

617
00:35:11,178 --> 00:35:12,577
<i>There's something you need to see.</i>

618
00:35:12,646 --> 00:35:14,136
I'm on my way.

619
00:35:16,883 --> 00:35:17,941
I got it.

620
00:35:18,018 --> 00:35:21,351
Now, the trigger wire is threaded.
Find it, but don't pull.

621
00:35:21,421 --> 00:35:23,116
Yeah, I know, it will blow up.

622
00:35:24,057 --> 00:35:25,820
Okay. Okay, now what?

623
00:35:26,627 --> 00:35:27,719
You didn't hear?

624
00:35:29,563 --> 00:35:33,897
No, I missed the last part.
I was hoping that you...

625
00:35:41,508 --> 00:35:42,736
Oh, God.

626
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:45,410
So, what are we looking at?

627
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,377
Well, this is the enhanced
command signal.

628
00:35:48,982 --> 00:35:52,418
It's now embedded within the frequencies
of the mind transfer itself.

629
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:55,511
Wait, are you saying you can
shut down the connection?

630
00:35:55,589 --> 00:35:58,524
Oh, yeah.
And I would have done a lot earlier

631
00:36:01,395 --> 00:36:04,296
if Dr. Covel hadn't been
sabotaging our efforts.

632
00:36:04,564 --> 00:36:06,896
- What?
- He altered one of the key algorithms.

633
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:08,229
I checked.

634
00:36:13,373 --> 00:36:14,897
Okay, I did it.

635
00:36:16,311 --> 00:36:20,213
You have to understand
that when we went back,

636
00:36:20,281 --> 00:36:22,181
and I saw that Geiger counter?

637
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:25,613
The radiation levels,
they're not survivable.

638
00:36:26,621 --> 00:36:30,819
- What are you saying?
- Our bodies, they're as good as dead,

639
00:36:30,992 --> 00:36:35,861
and I just panicked,
and I needed some time to think.

640
00:36:36,164 --> 00:36:38,928
You know what happens when someone
dies at the end of a connection.

641
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,398
No, no, no, because Dr. Perry
was in a weakened condition.

642
00:36:41,602 --> 00:36:44,503
It is possible that a healthy person
could have survived.

643
00:36:44,772 --> 00:36:46,069
So, wait a minute, what did you do?

644
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,802
You decided to help yourself
to this new body? Is that what you did?

645
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:53,040
Why do they get to live and we don't?
They put us in this position!

646
00:36:53,681 --> 00:36:55,342
It was easy for them to take a risk,

647
00:36:55,416 --> 00:36:58,010
because they weren't going
to have to suffer the consequences!

648
00:37:00,421 --> 00:37:01,649
Colonel...

649
00:37:03,157 --> 00:37:06,649
Colonel Young,
could you get Varro down here?

650
00:37:07,095 --> 00:37:10,690
He can go over the instructions again,
and you can send us back.

651
00:37:10,798 --> 00:37:11,856
I'm not going.

652
00:37:13,134 --> 00:37:14,601
You don't have a choice.

653
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:18,936
We should try again.
Okay, we know which wire is the trigger.

654
00:37:19,173 --> 00:37:20,697
He said not to pull it.

655
00:37:20,775 --> 00:37:22,504
So we find another way to release it.

656
00:37:22,577 --> 00:37:24,943
Yeah, and if we're wrong,
this bomb blows up!

657
00:37:25,012 --> 00:37:28,470
It's gonna blow up anyway, right?
So what do we have to lose?

658
00:37:28,549 --> 00:37:30,107
But what about all the people out there,

659
00:37:30,184 --> 00:37:33,915
the people that we have to assume
are being evacuated from this area?

660
00:37:33,988 --> 00:37:36,684
Every second gives more of them a chance

661
00:37:36,758 --> 00:37:42,560
to get as far away from here as possible.

662
00:37:44,432 --> 00:37:45,899
You're right.

663
00:37:50,438 --> 00:37:56,274
So we just wait for it to happen.

664
00:38:20,235 --> 00:38:22,066
You know,

665
00:38:22,671 --> 00:38:27,540
I'm sorry we never
got along better, Ronald.

666
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:31,871
It's just we see things differently.

667
00:38:32,047 --> 00:38:38,509
I mean, you like to take action,
and I like to talk things through.

668
00:38:38,821 --> 00:38:44,282
Well, we're here now,
and we're not going anywhere,

669
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:46,418
so let's talk.

670
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:57,832
I can't think of anything else to say.

671
00:39:09,318 --> 00:39:10,751
I'm sorry...

672
00:39:16,158 --> 00:39:17,819
Remember, don't pull the wire.

673
00:39:18,794 --> 00:39:20,227
Oh, I've got it.

674
00:39:20,496 --> 00:39:22,123
You're sure? You're ready for this?

675
00:39:32,307 --> 00:39:34,673
Just one more thing, Colonel.

676
00:39:35,143 --> 00:39:37,442
Could you tell Chloe that I'm proud of her?

677
00:39:38,548 --> 00:39:39,708
Of course.

678
00:40:30,133 --> 00:40:31,430
Have you heard anything?

679
00:40:33,136 --> 00:40:34,398
Not yet.

680
00:40:35,772 --> 00:40:37,433
We've been back for hours.

681
00:40:38,575 --> 00:40:40,008
I know.

682
00:40:40,076 --> 00:40:43,807
We're gonna keep someone on the stones
24/7 until we get a connection.

683
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,279
If we get a connection.

684
00:40:52,789 --> 00:40:55,690
I heard you have a friend who lives in DC.

685
00:40:57,226 --> 00:40:58,659
Sharon.

686
00:40:59,395 --> 00:41:02,990
She's more than a friend, actually.

687
00:41:06,102 --> 00:41:08,900
I wish I could talk to her
one more time, you know?

688
00:41:09,038 --> 00:41:11,472
Tell her how much she means to me.

689
00:41:11,808 --> 00:41:13,105
Yeah.

690
00:41:16,012 --> 00:41:17,639
I've been thinking about my mom.

691
00:41:20,918 --> 00:41:25,184
You know, things haven't really been
that good between us.

692
00:41:27,491 --> 00:41:31,086
She never really wanted me
to join the military.

693
00:41:36,934 --> 00:41:42,702
Last time I saw her, I didn't really say
everything that I wanted to say.

694
00:41:47,611 --> 00:41:51,672
She's your mother, Ron. She knows.

695
00:41:56,286 --> 00:41:59,380
Anyway, I'm sure this
will all get resolved,

696
00:41:59,456 --> 00:42:03,950
and you can go
and tell her yourself soon enough.

697
00:42:05,362 --> 00:42:06,522
Right.

698
00:42:08,766 --> 00:42:10,165
Soon enough.

699
00:43:29,347 --> 00:43:30,336
English - US - SDH
