1
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:08,623
<i>I may be on the verge of discovering
the true nature of Destiny's mission.</i>

2
00:00:09,868 --> 00:00:12,962
<i>You've had control of this ship
the whole time!</i>

3
00:00:13,037 --> 00:00:14,470
Why wouldn't you tell anyone?

4
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:17,565
The Lucian Alliance is planning
an attack on Earth.

5
00:00:18,042 --> 00:00:21,136
<i>I killed Riley.
I suffocated him with my own hands.</i>

6
00:00:21,212 --> 00:00:23,441
You are a good commander.

7
00:00:23,514 --> 00:00:26,278
<i>There is no mission other
than getting these people home.</i>

8
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,547
<i>It was never about going home, it's
about getting us to where we're going.</i>

9
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,054
That is the mission.

10
00:00:32,122 --> 00:00:34,488
<i>I've just been going over
the shuttle's navigational data</i>

11
00:00:34,591 --> 00:00:36,957
<i>trying to figure out the path
you took back to Destiny.</i>

12
00:00:37,027 --> 00:00:39,257
<i>It seems you were there,
and then you were here.</i>

13
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:40,353
<i>Nothing in between.</i>

14
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,762
Every square inch of this thing
is in perfect factory condition.

15
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:43,925
<i>There's hundreds
of these things!</i>

16
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:45,832
<i>There's no way we're going to be
able to shoot them all down!</i>

17
00:00:45,903 --> 00:00:47,370
How's that damage report coming?

18
00:00:47,437 --> 00:00:48,904
I'll arrange a briefing
when we're ready,

19
00:00:48,972 --> 00:00:50,030
but it's not going to be pretty.

20
00:00:50,107 --> 00:00:51,836
<i>I'm supposed to
be back to normal.</i>

21
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:54,002
<i>You managed to retain
some of the knowledge you gained.</i>

22
00:00:54,077 --> 00:00:55,169
<i>I should think that's a good thing.</i>

23
00:00:55,245 --> 00:00:56,837
Because I can still be useful.

24
00:00:56,914 --> 00:00:59,348
Everyone on this ship is useful.

25
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,741
We all belong here.

26
00:01:04,086 --> 00:01:06,816
All right, somebody say something.
How bad is it?

27
00:01:06,889 --> 00:01:09,357
It isn't any one thing,
it's the accumulation.

28
00:01:09,425 --> 00:01:11,552
This ship just wasn't up
to fighting a battle like that.

29
00:01:11,627 --> 00:01:14,960
A big chunk of the life support
is still down, too.

30
00:01:15,164 --> 00:01:16,688
Well, you can repair it, right?

31
00:01:16,766 --> 00:01:17,960
With what?

32
00:01:18,034 --> 00:01:20,195
Even if we knew how,
we don't have the spare parts.

33
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:23,736
I mean, I'm talking about things
that are broken and burnt out,

34
00:01:23,806 --> 00:01:25,330
that I don't even know what they do.

35
00:01:25,408 --> 00:01:28,866
Now, if life support was our only problem
we might be able to figure something out.

36
00:01:28,945 --> 00:01:31,140
But there are dozens of systems
on the brink of failure.

37
00:01:31,214 --> 00:01:32,681
Weapons, shields...

38
00:01:32,748 --> 00:01:34,716
Well, they're operating.

39
00:01:35,084 --> 00:01:36,779
And at mission critical levels?

40
00:01:37,853 --> 00:01:40,320
We are down to one last everything.

41
00:01:40,622 --> 00:01:41,884
There's practically no redundancy.

42
00:01:41,957 --> 00:01:43,083
"Practically no redundancy."

43
00:01:43,191 --> 00:01:45,989
- Wasn't funny the first three times!
- Well, I'm very tired.

44
00:01:46,061 --> 00:01:48,461
Okay, we know what the problems are.
What are the solutions?

45
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,800
Well, what I think we're trying to say...

46
00:01:53,868 --> 00:01:56,200
We make do as best we can
and carry on with the mission.

47
00:01:56,271 --> 00:01:58,535
Well, it doesn't sound like
that's what they were trying to say.

48
00:01:58,607 --> 00:02:00,404
You're talking like we have a choice here.

49
00:02:00,475 --> 00:02:02,306
- Actually...
- Eli, please...

50
00:02:02,377 --> 00:02:04,607
Ginn and I figured out

51
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:08,581
<i>how to dial the ninth chevron back to Earth
while Destiny recharges in a star.</i>

52
00:02:09,517 --> 00:02:11,985
- Without blowing up the ship, you mean?
- Yeah.

53
00:02:12,053 --> 00:02:13,350
- No.
- Here we go.

54
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:16,116
Look, Eli's solution however brilliant,

55
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,590
fails to consider the thousand things
that could go wrong

56
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:20,627
when attempting to open
a wormhole in a star.

57
00:02:20,694 --> 00:02:21,888
I can show you the simulation.

58
00:02:21,962 --> 00:02:24,624
More to the point, it could cause
the same kind of overload

59
00:02:24,698 --> 00:02:25,960
that happened on Icarus.

60
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:28,024
Well, who cares if we're not even
going to be here?

61
00:02:28,102 --> 00:02:29,330
Well, I do, Lieutenant.

62
00:02:29,403 --> 00:02:31,633
Along with anyone else
who cares to remain aboard this ship.

63
00:02:31,705 --> 00:02:34,173
Rush, come on, man.
Nobody in their right mind would stay.

64
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:36,641
You said you understood
how important this mission was.

65
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,473
- I did.
- So what's changed?

66
00:02:38,545 --> 00:02:40,274
Nicholas, you know what's changed.

67
00:02:40,347 --> 00:02:42,645
Look, I was all aboard with this,
you know that,

68
00:02:42,716 --> 00:02:44,946
but if the ship can't fly,
there is no mission.

69
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:46,111
It's not like we're just giving up here.

70
00:02:46,186 --> 00:02:47,517
Well, that's exactly what we're doing.

71
00:02:47,588 --> 00:02:49,180
Well, fortunately for the
people on this ship,

72
00:02:49,256 --> 00:02:50,382
the decision is not yours to make.

73
00:02:50,457 --> 00:02:52,425
Well, thankfully it's not
your bloody decision either...

74
00:02:52,493 --> 00:02:54,050
- Rush!
- We can get through this!

75
00:02:54,127 --> 00:02:55,594
They are just being defeatist!

76
00:02:55,662 --> 00:02:58,893
My first responsibility
is the safety of these people.

77
00:02:59,999 --> 00:03:01,057
I'm sorry.

78
00:03:03,536 --> 00:03:04,764
Yeah, right.

79
00:03:30,296 --> 00:03:32,024
- Oh, whoa.
- Stand aside, Sergeant.

80
00:03:33,632 --> 00:03:36,965
- I can't do that. Colonel's orders.
- Since when?

81
00:03:37,336 --> 00:03:38,735
Just now.

82
00:03:40,205 --> 00:03:41,194
Did he say why?

83
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:43,167
I didn't ask.

84
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,203
Okay, could you tell me where else
I've been banned from?

85
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:48,541
Save me wasting my time.

86
00:03:48,613 --> 00:03:50,774
Pretty much any place
that you can push buttons.

87
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,474
Ah.

88
00:03:52,884 --> 00:03:54,943
And I've got people
where all the buttons are.

89
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:02,758
<i>Destiny's course is
taking us toward a star</i>

90
00:04:02,828 --> 00:04:05,388
roughly 18 hours ahead,
we assume to recharge.

91
00:04:05,464 --> 00:04:07,329
We should be ready.

92
00:04:07,399 --> 00:04:09,491
Oh, we've been ready for a long time.

93
00:04:09,567 --> 00:04:10,761
I'm ready, and I just got here.

94
00:04:10,868 --> 00:04:12,495
I can only imagine what it's like for you.

95
00:04:20,544 --> 00:04:22,307
Hi. We've been expecting you.

96
00:04:22,813 --> 00:04:24,713
Well, it seems you can predict
my every move.

97
00:04:24,782 --> 00:04:27,512
Well, I had to make sure you didn't
lock us out of the dialing programs.

98
00:04:27,752 --> 00:04:30,482
The thought never crossed my mind.

99
00:04:32,256 --> 00:04:34,156
I see the elders have gathered.

100
00:04:36,594 --> 00:04:39,791
You should know
Eli is using the stones right now

101
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:42,059
to run his calculations
by the best people on Earth.

102
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,656
They'll tell him what I told him.

103
00:04:43,734 --> 00:04:45,759
The work is brilliant,
but what works on paper

104
00:04:45,836 --> 00:04:48,167
does not necessarily work within a star.

105
00:04:48,238 --> 00:04:50,570
Well, Eli said that he's taken that
into consideration.

106
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,039
Eli is not an astrophysicist.

107
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:57,445
Inside a star there are magnetic fields,

108
00:04:57,514 --> 00:05:00,244
enormous pressures, solar flares,

109
00:05:00,316 --> 00:05:04,309
conditions that make events
unpredictable by any mathematics.

110
00:05:05,155 --> 00:05:08,647
Now, will Eli's connection to Earth work?

111
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:09,851
Possibly.

112
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:12,554
But what happens the moment
that wormhole has been established

113
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:13,789
is anybody's guess.

114
00:05:13,863 --> 00:05:16,058
It could blow a hole in the fabric
of space-time.

115
00:05:16,132 --> 00:05:17,656
He's out of his freaking mind,
you know that?

116
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:21,328
All right.
So, what are you asking us to do?

117
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:24,267
Let me talk to the crew.

118
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:26,603
At least some of them understand
how important it is

119
00:05:26,675 --> 00:05:28,074
to remain on this ship.

120
00:05:28,143 --> 00:05:29,735
Nobody is going to agree to that!

121
00:05:29,812 --> 00:05:34,340
You say you have no choice but to leave.
I have no choice but to stay.

122
00:05:36,552 --> 00:05:38,281
We're going to brief
everyone in the Gate Room

123
00:05:38,353 --> 00:05:39,581
the minute we come out of FTL.

124
00:05:39,655 --> 00:05:41,680
You can address them then.

125
00:05:42,991 --> 00:05:46,722
It would carry far more weight
if you were standing alongside me.

126
00:05:48,997 --> 00:05:50,294
I can do that.

127
00:05:57,105 --> 00:05:58,436
Thank you.

128
00:06:04,045 --> 00:06:05,239
You're not serious.

129
00:06:06,447 --> 00:06:07,971
Oh, I think he is.

130
00:06:15,423 --> 00:06:17,687
We've run the simulation
a dozen times. It works.

131
00:06:17,758 --> 00:06:21,159
So, the gamer came up
with power flow algorithm?

132
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:22,594
Eli, yeah.

133
00:06:22,964 --> 00:06:25,558
I gotta say, you know,
when we tried to solve this back on Earth,

134
00:06:25,633 --> 00:06:28,568
there were a lot of
smart people in that room.

135
00:06:28,636 --> 00:06:29,967
Yeah, well, don't tell him I said this,

136
00:06:30,037 --> 00:06:32,631
but he's arguably the smartest person
I've ever met...

137
00:06:33,274 --> 00:06:34,571
You all right?

138
00:06:34,642 --> 00:06:37,076
- I'm fine. I'm back.
- What did they say?

139
00:06:38,212 --> 00:06:39,644
The math works, so we're on.

140
00:06:41,948 --> 00:06:45,213
Who was the smartest person
you were just talking about?

141
00:06:46,486 --> 00:06:47,544
Einstein.

142
00:06:51,191 --> 00:06:52,215
Einstein?

143
00:06:52,826 --> 00:06:54,817
Yeah, he was... He was pretty smart.

144
00:06:55,362 --> 00:06:57,421
But don't ever tell him you said that?

145
00:06:57,697 --> 00:07:01,155
All right, come on,
let's go tell the Colonel the news.

146
00:07:30,963 --> 00:07:33,864
- Hey, T.J., can you give us a minute?
- Yeah.

147
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:37,701
Can you keep this ship flying?

148
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:38,828
Yeah, with help.

149
00:07:38,904 --> 00:07:41,338
Then I need to know an absolute
minimum number of personnel

150
00:07:41,407 --> 00:07:42,396
you need to do it.

151
00:07:43,342 --> 00:07:44,934
Well, as many as possible, obviously.

152
00:07:45,044 --> 00:07:46,102
I need a number.

153
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,906
I'll say a dozen.

154
00:07:49,014 --> 00:07:50,038
Plus you and me?

155
00:07:54,018 --> 00:07:55,781
No, including us.

156
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,944
So, 10.

157
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,458
Yeah, look, I've written down
most of what I intend to say.

158
00:08:01,526 --> 00:08:02,993
If you've got anything
you might want to add...

159
00:08:03,061 --> 00:08:05,461
<i>Everett,
is Rush in the Gate Room with you?</i>

160
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,724
Yeah, what is it?

161
00:08:06,798 --> 00:08:08,060
<i>I need both of you on the bridge.</i>

162
00:08:08,132 --> 00:08:09,531
We don't have time for this just now.

163
00:08:09,601 --> 00:08:11,933
David, we were just gonna talk to the crew.
Can it wait?

164
00:08:12,136 --> 00:08:14,502
<i>Negative! Get up here. Trust me.</i>

165
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,136
We have time.

166
00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:20,602
Yeah. Time they might need to decide.

167
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:23,003
Just keep everyone here.
We'll be right back.

168
00:08:23,514 --> 00:08:24,811
Uh, sure.

169
00:08:33,924 --> 00:08:35,186
What is it?

170
00:08:36,026 --> 00:08:37,357
It was in orbit around the star.

171
00:08:37,427 --> 00:08:39,895
<i>Destiny picked it up
when it turned towards us,</i>

172
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:41,965
and then we got the radio broadcast.

173
00:08:42,032 --> 00:08:43,090
From who?

174
00:08:43,934 --> 00:08:45,128
You.

175
00:08:46,603 --> 00:08:47,661
I don't understand.

176
00:08:47,804 --> 00:08:51,331
Neither do we. Wait for it.

177
00:08:53,677 --> 00:08:54,803
Wait for what?

178
00:08:54,878 --> 00:08:58,006
<i>I repeat, this is Dr.
Nicholas Rush calling the Destiny.</i>

179
00:08:58,081 --> 00:09:01,539
<i>I'm aboard the shuttle headed your way.
Please respond.</i>

180
00:09:01,618 --> 00:09:04,781
Well, isn't this an
interesting turn of events?

181
00:09:04,855 --> 00:09:06,015
What is this?

182
00:09:06,123 --> 00:09:08,387
Well, I wouldn't know, Colonel.
How about you tell me?

183
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,255
Well, it's not a recording,
if that's what you're thinking.

184
00:09:11,327 --> 00:09:12,817
It's a subspace broadcast,

185
00:09:12,895 --> 00:09:14,954
and beyond the fact
that it sounds exactly like Rush,

186
00:09:15,031 --> 00:09:18,933
I can tell that that's our shuttle,
and it's on an intercept course.

187
00:09:19,001 --> 00:09:22,402
<i>Even though according to this, the
shuttle is still docked with Destiny.</i>

188
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:24,433
<i>Again, this is Dr. Rush.</i>

189
00:09:24,507 --> 00:09:26,566
<i>I need assistance
with the docking procedure.</i>

190
00:09:26,642 --> 00:09:28,041
<i>I know you can hear me.</i>

191
00:09:30,813 --> 00:09:32,144
Have we responded yet?

192
00:09:32,214 --> 00:09:33,408
No, not yet.

193
00:09:33,482 --> 00:09:36,576
Well, best not to keep me waiting.

194
00:09:41,257 --> 00:09:44,454
Hello, this is also Dr. Nicholas Rush.
How can we be of assistance?

195
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:49,024
<i>Tell them not to try
and dial Earth. It won't work.</i>

196
00:09:49,097 --> 00:09:50,894
<i>If they go through with it,
they're all going to die.</i>

197
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,627
This is Colonel Young.
Dr. Rush is sitting right next to me.

198
00:09:53,702 --> 00:09:56,762
Yes, obviously. We've just spoken.

199
00:09:56,838 --> 00:10:01,434
The only reasonable explanation is that
somehow I've come back through time.

200
00:10:02,444 --> 00:10:04,036
Reasonable explanation?

201
00:10:04,112 --> 00:10:07,172
<i>I couldn't be sure until I
seen you dropping out of FTL,</i>

202
00:10:07,248 --> 00:10:10,684
which happened roughly 12 hours ago
in my timeline.

203
00:10:10,752 --> 00:10:13,277
And we're supposed to
just take your word for this?

204
00:10:13,722 --> 00:10:17,818
Shortly after we dropped out of FTL,
Colonel, you asked me for a number.

205
00:10:17,892 --> 00:10:19,883
I told you 10, plus two.

206
00:10:26,633 --> 00:10:27,657
Twelve?

207
00:10:27,735 --> 00:10:30,704
That's well calculated, Mr. Volker,
but I think you're missing the point here.

208
00:10:31,238 --> 00:10:33,103
Is that true?
Did you just have that conversation?

209
00:10:33,173 --> 00:10:35,539
Yeah. Yeah, we did.

210
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,654
It's weird.
I was completely stoked about this mission.

211
00:10:50,724 --> 00:10:52,157
Yeah, we all were.

212
00:10:52,226 --> 00:10:54,490
All of a sudden I can't wait to see my kid.

213
00:10:54,895 --> 00:10:57,989
Wow. Gosh, and I thought
the hardest thing was going to be

214
00:10:58,065 --> 00:10:59,259
introducing you to my mom.

215
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,994
Okay, that makes me more nervous
than going through the dang gate.

216
00:11:02,869 --> 00:11:07,670
Hey, when we get back,
we're all still gonna hang out, right?

217
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,971
- Yeah, of course we will.
- We will have a reunion every year.

218
00:11:11,244 --> 00:11:13,178
I was thinking more along
the lines of Fridays.

219
00:11:14,013 --> 00:11:16,277
Depends on whether
you're stationed Earth-side.

220
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:19,245
I can guarantee you
that Earth will be my station.

221
00:11:19,418 --> 00:11:20,817
But you're joining Stargate Command.

222
00:11:20,887 --> 00:11:22,946
Like they're gonna ask me.

223
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,151
They'll ask you, Eli.

224
00:11:26,225 --> 00:11:29,820
You'll be right up there
with the other SGC brainiacs,

225
00:11:29,896 --> 00:11:31,887
like Dr. Jackson and Colonel Carter,

226
00:11:31,964 --> 00:11:35,092
and, uh, what was that guy's name
who kept staring at your...

227
00:11:35,168 --> 00:11:36,635
Ugh, McKay.

228
00:11:36,702 --> 00:11:39,226
Yeah, McKay.
They'll ask you right when we get back.

229
00:11:39,304 --> 00:11:40,999
<i>Lieutenant Scott, come in.</i>

230
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,735
Yes, sir, is there a problem?

231
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:46,903
<i>Yeah. Join up with Greer,
head to Shuttle Bay 2.</i>

232
00:12:09,267 --> 00:12:10,359
Open it.

233
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,268
Easy!

234
00:12:23,347 --> 00:12:25,838
Don't listen to him!
He's gonna try and kill you all!

235
00:12:34,124 --> 00:12:35,921
What in the hell?

236
00:12:35,993 --> 00:12:37,460
T.J., this is Young.

237
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:40,087
Yes, sir, the gang's all here.

238
00:12:40,164 --> 00:12:43,759
<i>Yeah, they're going to have to wait.
We need you in the infirmary.</i>

239
00:12:58,715 --> 00:13:01,377
- How did you get the burn?
- There was an overload.

240
00:13:02,585 --> 00:13:04,917
I couldn't stop it.

241
00:13:04,988 --> 00:13:07,582
Explosions all over the ship
one after another.

242
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:11,856
The air became so toxic,
I had no choice but to abandon.

243
00:13:11,928 --> 00:13:15,386
And at which point, you somehow
went back 12 hours in time?

244
00:13:15,465 --> 00:13:19,094
No, no, no, that would
have to happen inside the star.

245
00:13:19,168 --> 00:13:23,332
The ship itself must have passed
very near a solar flare,

246
00:13:23,406 --> 00:13:26,341
in the exact moment
we locked the ninth chevron address.

247
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:30,436
A temporal event, like we've seen,
cause time travel through wormholes.

248
00:13:31,614 --> 00:13:33,137
It somehow affected the entire ship.

249
00:13:34,249 --> 00:13:37,412
One of those unpredictable things
I remember warning you about.

250
00:13:42,824 --> 00:13:44,223
What are you smiling at?

251
00:13:44,293 --> 00:13:45,590
Well, you should know.

252
00:13:45,661 --> 00:13:48,596
What, fascinating, is it?

253
00:13:48,664 --> 00:13:51,132
Well, you wouldn't think so if you'd
been through what I've been through.

254
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,757
Well, I won't have to now, will I?

255
00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:57,362
Look, we can still do this
if we could just learn from your mistakes.

256
00:13:57,439 --> 00:14:00,499
My mistakes? The only mistake
was trying it in the first place!

257
00:14:00,575 --> 00:14:02,065
No, no, wait a second, she's right.

258
00:14:02,144 --> 00:14:03,668
Just because it went wrong
the first time round...

259
00:14:03,745 --> 00:14:06,179
Wait, isn't it the same time again?

260
00:14:06,248 --> 00:14:07,647
No, not entirely.

261
00:14:07,716 --> 00:14:10,275
We'd end up with two of us
staying behind next time.

262
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:12,683
If we kept going long enough,
we'd soon have an entire crew.

263
00:14:12,753 --> 00:14:15,119
We still have an hour
before we run Eli's program.

264
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:16,178
Tell us what happened.

265
00:14:17,825 --> 00:14:20,885
Up to the point you received
my radio signal, you know what happened.

266
00:14:20,962 --> 00:14:22,190
I need a number.

267
00:14:23,564 --> 00:14:24,758
I'll say a dozen.

268
00:14:24,832 --> 00:14:25,821
Plus you and me?

269
00:14:29,904 --> 00:14:31,872
No, including us.

270
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:32,928
So, 10.

271
00:14:34,642 --> 00:14:37,042
Yeah, look, I've written down
most of what I intend to say.

272
00:14:37,111 --> 00:14:38,601
If you've got anything
you might want to add...

273
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:41,910
So, I'll speak when you're done.
But just so we're clear,

274
00:14:41,983 --> 00:14:43,780
if we don't get the 10 volunteers...

275
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:45,250
We will.

276
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:47,041
Okay.

277
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:52,657
You were true to your word, Colonel.

278
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,619
You stood alongside me.

279
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:58,528
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I could have your attention, please?

280
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,594
Dr. Rush would like to say a few words.

281
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:08,140
My friends...

282
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:15,907
Well, yes, perhaps that's an overstatement,

283
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:19,247
but we are at least shipmates,

284
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:23,653
who have, up until now,
shared great adversity.

285
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,755
I know a lot of you, probably most of you,

286
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:32,388
also share the hope of going home.

287
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:37,424
It is a fact that the
conditions inside a star

288
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:41,030
bode very poorly for the sustained
viability of a wormhole,

289
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,131
and I owe it to you all to tell you that.

290
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,369
Stop trying to scare people
and get on with this.

291
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,504
The Ancients did not devote

292
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:54,609
the efforts of an entire generation
to build this ship on a whim.

293
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,321
<i>Neither was Destiny named on a whim.</i>

294
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:01,949
Over a million years ago,

295
00:16:02,026 --> 00:16:05,052
the Ancients discovered
a complex structure

296
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:07,962
buried deep within
the background radiation,

297
00:16:08,032 --> 00:16:10,500
the fingerprints of an intelligence

298
00:16:10,568 --> 00:16:14,664
that existed very near the beginning
of time itself.

299
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:19,403
<i>Destiny was launched
in search of that intelligence.</i>

300
00:16:19,477 --> 00:16:21,707
Who knows how close we are to finding it?

301
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:26,512
How close we are to learning,
in the Ancients' words,

302
00:16:26,584 --> 00:16:28,711
"The destiny of all things."

303
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:33,149
I don't pretend to know
when that's going to be,

304
00:16:33,224 --> 00:16:36,216
in which stars it will happen,

305
00:16:36,294 --> 00:16:39,729
or even how that will change
our view of the universe.

306
00:16:40,964 --> 00:16:45,025
<i>I only know that Destiny
has come this far,</i>

307
00:16:45,102 --> 00:16:47,502
and if we abandon her now,

308
00:16:50,774 --> 00:16:52,867
there'll be no coming back.

309
00:16:55,112 --> 00:16:57,876
All of that knowledge will be lost forever.

310
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:04,985
I believe this journey
is the reason I'm here,

311
00:17:05,055 --> 00:17:07,250
but I can't hope to do it alone.

312
00:17:08,658 --> 00:17:10,717
I ask you to come with me.

313
00:17:14,097 --> 00:17:19,932
Now, I believe that those of you
who want to go home

314
00:17:20,002 --> 00:17:21,333
deserve that chance.

315
00:17:21,403 --> 00:17:26,204
But I joined Stargate Command for a reason,

316
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:29,574
so I, too, am willing to stay aboard.

317
00:17:32,014 --> 00:17:38,647
What we are looking for are 10 volunteers,

318
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:40,154
so I am asking,

319
00:17:40,222 --> 00:17:44,682
those of you who want to be here,

320
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,489
please step forward.

321
00:18:30,471 --> 00:18:32,495
All right, listen to me!

322
00:18:32,573 --> 00:18:35,303
You've already accomplished
the damn mission!

323
00:18:36,243 --> 00:18:38,643
Our goal was to investigate
the ninth chevron address,

324
00:18:38,712 --> 00:18:40,373
and you've done that.

325
00:18:41,582 --> 00:18:43,777
Now, I do not deny that
there once was a mission,

326
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:46,410
but if it was as important
as Rush claims it to be,

327
00:18:46,486 --> 00:18:48,454
they sure as hell couldn't
expect us to do it.

328
00:18:48,989 --> 00:18:52,982
There is no noble voyage
to save the universe or to meet God,

329
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,654
or whatever it is that
Rush has sold you on!

330
00:18:55,729 --> 00:18:58,596
There is only the day that this ship dies!

331
00:18:58,732 --> 00:19:00,757
David, we don't know that.

332
00:19:01,735 --> 00:19:03,999
I've got a good mind to try
to take you all back by force.

333
00:19:04,504 --> 00:19:05,835
Good luck with that.

334
00:19:11,644 --> 00:19:13,703
Those of you still taking part
in the evacuation

335
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:15,838
are going to form two lines.

336
00:19:16,649 --> 00:19:18,742
Everything we carry with us
becomes a projectile

337
00:19:18,818 --> 00:19:20,046
in a nine-chevron transit,

338
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:23,885
so we are going home with the clothes
on our backs, nothing more.

339
00:19:23,956 --> 00:19:28,518
Eli has warned them to expect us,
but it seems that a radio signal

340
00:19:28,594 --> 00:19:31,188
does not reach across
a nine chevron connection,

341
00:19:31,264 --> 00:19:34,392
so I'll go first to warn them
that we're on our way.

342
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:38,096
You will follow in three-second intervals,
two at a time.

343
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,899
Eli, are we ready?

344
00:19:40,406 --> 00:19:43,898
Yeah, the program's all set.
You're good to go.

345
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:55,548
Fifteen minutes, people, and we go home!

346
00:19:56,988 --> 00:20:00,480
And 15 minutes after that, you were dead.

347
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:06,756
If all those people stayed aboard,
why were you the only survivor?

348
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,389
I told you, there was an overload.

349
00:20:08,466 --> 00:20:11,435
It doesn't matter.
We have a second chance now.

350
00:20:12,203 --> 00:20:14,068
You just need to tell us what went wrong,

351
00:20:14,139 --> 00:20:15,367
what can we do differently.

352
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,274
Eli's program is based on precise timing
in the recharging process.

353
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:20,936
A time which is fast approaching.

354
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:24,413
All right, so you dialed
the ninth chevron and...

355
00:20:24,482 --> 00:20:27,245
And it worked. We made the connection.

356
00:20:54,778 --> 00:20:55,972
Chevron nine is locked!

357
00:21:01,452 --> 00:21:03,282
Wait three seconds, then follow me!

358
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:09,955
- No, no, wait, wait!
Stop!

359
00:21:11,761 --> 00:21:13,729
- What is it?
- The wormhole's unstable.

360
00:21:13,796 --> 00:21:14,785
See for yourself.

361
00:21:14,864 --> 00:21:16,331
- Well, shut it down.
- I can't.

362
00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:18,492
One of the mains blew out,
my program can't compensate.

363
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,900
We'll have to configure
the power levels on the fly.

364
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,598
Yes, Eli, that's what I'm doing.
I've almost got it.

365
00:21:23,673 --> 00:21:25,766
Everybody, stand by!

366
00:21:30,513 --> 00:21:33,107
That's as stable as we're gonna get.

367
00:21:33,182 --> 00:21:34,672
Okay, go, go, go!

368
00:21:48,597 --> 00:21:49,723
It's beginning to overload!

369
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:51,425
Well, we were supposed to be gone by now!

370
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,797
We can't stay ahead of this!

371
00:21:56,638 --> 00:21:58,037
We're losing her!

372
00:21:59,341 --> 00:22:01,502
That's it, everyone, we're going through!
Let's go!

373
00:22:01,576 --> 00:22:03,976
All right, you heard him.
Let's go! Come on!

374
00:22:08,183 --> 00:22:10,913
Eli, there's nothing more you can do.

375
00:22:17,025 --> 00:22:18,491
Eli, get the hell out of here!

376
00:22:21,829 --> 00:22:24,297
- Rush...
- I can't maintain a stable connection,

377
00:22:24,365 --> 00:22:26,162
and argue with you at the same time.
Now, please go.

378
00:22:27,735 --> 00:22:28,724
Go!

379
00:22:49,557 --> 00:22:53,254
I don't really know how
long I stayed there.

380
00:22:53,327 --> 00:22:54,851
It felt like hours.

381
00:22:56,029 --> 00:23:00,989
<i>I kept waiting for the end to come,
but Destiny fought to stay alive.</i>

382
00:23:02,435 --> 00:23:06,667
How are you sure that we...
They all didn't make it?

383
00:23:08,975 --> 00:23:11,569
I didn't say they all didn't make it.

384
00:23:36,869 --> 00:23:39,702
I'm Dr. Rush.
How many of them made it through?

385
00:23:39,771 --> 00:23:42,137
I'm sorry, sir. Only one, hours ago.

386
00:23:42,975 --> 00:23:46,706
He's been waiting to switch with someone
to see why the others didn't follow.

387
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:02,655
The connection was made,

388
00:24:02,728 --> 00:24:05,128
but you were the only one
who made it through to Earth.

389
00:24:18,142 --> 00:24:20,542
We were told we'd be leaving
for Earth by now.

390
00:24:20,611 --> 00:24:21,805
What's happening?

391
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:23,437
Some funky, funky stuff, man.

392
00:24:24,482 --> 00:24:27,042
<i>Lieutenant Scott, come in.</i>

393
00:24:27,118 --> 00:24:29,746
Sir, you are cutting it awful close here.

394
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,152
Stand down, Lieutenant,
we've decided not to go ahead.

395
00:24:32,223 --> 00:24:34,589
- You've got to be kidding me.
Sir?

396
00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:37,992
<i>We have reason to believe the evacuees
will not make it through alive.</i>

397
00:24:38,062 --> 00:24:40,223
Send everyone to their quarters.

398
00:24:40,298 --> 00:24:41,629
Understood.

399
00:24:51,775 --> 00:24:54,710
- You made the right decision.
- Yeah, about bloody time.

400
00:24:54,778 --> 00:24:56,803
I want to use the stones
to confirm his story.

401
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,939
Well, we've never used
the stones inside a star,

402
00:24:59,015 --> 00:25:00,812
and I don't think now is
the time to start it,

403
00:25:00,884 --> 00:25:01,873
but I'll tell you what,

404
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:04,250
you can go talk to yourself
once we're safely on the other side.

405
00:25:04,321 --> 00:25:05,583
Safely.

406
00:25:05,655 --> 00:25:07,816
I think now we all need
to be on the bridge.

407
00:25:08,491 --> 00:25:12,518
Oh, well, at least I'll have someone
to engage in a decent conversation.

408
00:25:27,843 --> 00:25:28,969
There it is.

409
00:25:29,478 --> 00:25:32,276
Well, I think that's confirmation,
don't you?

410
00:25:32,348 --> 00:25:34,145
We're altering course and accelerating.

411
00:25:34,216 --> 00:25:36,081
But we're close enough
to get a decent look at her.

412
00:26:09,751 --> 00:26:12,276
There but for the grace of God, huh?

413
00:26:12,353 --> 00:26:13,547
It's my fault.

414
00:26:14,956 --> 00:26:18,357
Everybody on that ship died because of me.

415
00:26:19,827 --> 00:26:23,558
Yeah, well, the only reason
we're even in this situation

416
00:26:23,631 --> 00:26:25,189
is because you were all trying to save me.

417
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,760
Do you guys see what I see?

418
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:29,325
What?

419
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,268
The damage is confined mostly
to the engineering spaces.

420
00:26:32,774 --> 00:26:34,799
The main living compartments look intact.

421
00:26:35,376 --> 00:26:36,365
So?

422
00:26:36,944 --> 00:26:38,571
I've got an idea.

423
00:26:41,081 --> 00:26:43,879
Out of the way, out of the way!
Move, move, move!

424
00:26:49,423 --> 00:26:51,653
You just said it was
falling back toward the star.

425
00:26:51,725 --> 00:26:54,250
- That was me, actually.
- Okay...

426
00:26:54,327 --> 00:26:57,057
I'm telling you,
we need to get over to that ship.

427
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:00,190
It might be worth the risk if we can
salvage ammunition, food, supplies...

428
00:27:00,267 --> 00:27:02,929
No, no, that's not what
he's talking about...

429
00:27:03,003 --> 00:27:06,029
- Well, what is it, then?
- Spare parts. I had the same idea.

430
00:27:06,106 --> 00:27:09,234
I ran the whole way, too, so...

431
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,501
Hmm.

432
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,845
How much time do we have
before we're out of range?

433
00:27:15,916 --> 00:27:18,577
Well, we can't take a shuttle,
the other ship is too close to the star,

434
00:27:18,651 --> 00:27:20,278
<i>and Destiny is accelerating away.</i>

435
00:27:20,753 --> 00:27:23,551
We can arrange a short FTL jump,
use the stargate.

436
00:27:23,823 --> 00:27:25,950
It's the same gate. Can it dial itself?

437
00:27:26,392 --> 00:27:28,019
I don't see why not.

438
00:27:28,094 --> 00:27:30,892
<i>Destiny's address isn't based
on a fixed point in space.</i>

439
00:27:30,963 --> 00:27:32,760
We'll have to input the
distance calculation,

440
00:27:32,832 --> 00:27:36,791
but you guys should be able
to work that out, right?

441
00:27:36,869 --> 00:27:39,167
Yeah, between me, Eli, and me.

442
00:27:40,139 --> 00:27:42,664
All right, well, let's, uh,
let's start putting together a list.

443
00:27:42,742 --> 00:27:43,834
Yeah.

444
00:27:45,277 --> 00:27:46,471
I'd like to lead the team over there.

445
00:27:46,545 --> 00:27:48,843
I should go as well.
I'm the only one who knows

446
00:27:48,914 --> 00:27:50,245
which systems were affected
by the overload.

447
00:27:50,316 --> 00:27:53,012
Listen, Rush, I don't even know
if that's what I should call you.

448
00:27:53,152 --> 00:27:54,210
Well, it is my name.

449
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,647
Fine. What I'm trying to say is that
you've been through hell and back.

450
00:27:57,722 --> 00:27:58,780
You don't got to do this.

451
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:01,324
The man wants to help, Everett,
let him help.

452
00:28:01,392 --> 00:28:03,326
We're gonna need all hands for this.

453
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,492
Okay.

454
00:28:16,975 --> 00:28:18,966
These are priority number one!

455
00:28:19,043 --> 00:28:21,034
We want as many
as we can get our hands on.

456
00:28:21,112 --> 00:28:23,706
This one's burnt out. This one's good.

457
00:28:23,782 --> 00:28:25,409
Now, they're in every console, power relay,

458
00:28:25,483 --> 00:28:27,849
and pretty much every piece of equipment
aboard the ship.

459
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,944
Open 'em up, pull 'em out and move on.

460
00:28:30,021 --> 00:28:31,113
What do you call those things?

461
00:28:31,189 --> 00:28:33,622
I don't know..."Things that make it go."

462
00:28:33,957 --> 00:28:37,290
We should find concentrations
of working parts in the bridge,

463
00:28:37,361 --> 00:28:39,989
control interface
and neural interface rooms.

464
00:28:40,063 --> 00:28:43,055
Number two, these things,
and don't ask me what they're called.

465
00:28:43,133 --> 00:28:45,158
I'm not even sure how they work.

466
00:28:45,235 --> 00:28:47,863
We also have to get our hands
on the other repair robot,

467
00:28:47,938 --> 00:28:49,200
and shield emitter relays.

468
00:28:49,273 --> 00:28:50,740
We'll get everything on the list.

469
00:28:50,808 --> 00:28:53,675
If there's still time, we'll move on
to our secondary objectives.

470
00:28:53,744 --> 00:28:54,972
Yeah, how much time do we have?

471
00:28:55,512 --> 00:28:57,139
We'll assess that once we're aboard.

472
00:28:57,214 --> 00:28:59,648
The conditions will be difficult
and they will be dangerous,

473
00:28:59,716 --> 00:29:02,844
but make no mistake,
we need to salvage these things

474
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,286
if we are going to survive.

475
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,050
Dial the gate. Everyone step back.

476
00:29:15,731 --> 00:29:16,720
Send the Kino.

477
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,408
It's getting hot already,
but the air is still breathable.

478
00:29:35,484 --> 00:29:36,644
I'd call it a green light.

479
00:29:37,253 --> 00:29:38,618
Let's move.

480
00:30:05,247 --> 00:30:07,044
Form into your teams and standby.

481
00:30:14,122 --> 00:30:15,646
Okay, I'm reading power and life support

482
00:30:15,724 --> 00:30:18,192
in both the bridge
and Control Interface Room.

483
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,784
Forty minutes till the shield fails.

484
00:30:20,395 --> 00:30:21,589
Then that's the time we have.

485
00:30:21,663 --> 00:30:23,722
Lieutenant, that means your team
heads straight to the armory.

486
00:30:23,798 --> 00:30:24,822
Got it.

487
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,424
You know your assignments, let's go!

488
00:30:28,168 --> 00:30:30,500
This is Telford. We are proceeding.
40 minutes on the clock.

489
00:30:30,571 --> 00:30:31,902
Okay, let's go.

490
00:30:32,973 --> 00:30:35,271
- David, be careful.
- Will do.

491
00:30:57,464 --> 00:30:59,898
Someone should report
to Homeworld Command,

492
00:30:59,967 --> 00:31:01,366
explain what's been going on.

493
00:31:01,435 --> 00:31:02,697
Well, you go ahead, and when you're back,

494
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:04,760
you can explain it to me.

495
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,366
They must think we're all dead.

496
00:31:09,475 --> 00:31:11,602
- It didn't happen.
- Yeah, it did.

497
00:31:11,678 --> 00:31:12,940
Not to us, Eli.

498
00:31:13,012 --> 00:31:17,073
You can say anything you like.
Tell me to take one timeline at a time,

499
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:21,246
but if Rush wasn't sent back
by a freak of physics,

500
00:31:21,321 --> 00:31:23,289
we'd all be dead by now.

501
00:31:46,411 --> 00:31:48,140
I'll start here.

502
00:31:48,213 --> 00:31:50,374
Let's make this quick. Spread out.

503
00:31:50,449 --> 00:31:52,314
Over here, guys.

504
00:31:56,388 --> 00:31:58,822
Want to try to get that alarm off?

505
00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:16,004
Start at the back!

506
00:32:31,155 --> 00:32:32,713
Guess we're not going in there.

507
00:32:54,011 --> 00:32:56,945
So, this must be pretty weird
for you two, huh?

508
00:32:57,013 --> 00:32:58,207
Yes.

509
00:33:02,118 --> 00:33:05,053
Half the ones I'm pulling are burnt out
from the overload.

510
00:33:05,121 --> 00:33:06,679
I'll take what we can get.

511
00:33:06,756 --> 00:33:08,917
Go get your CO2 nodes.
We need to breathe, too.

512
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,957
Penhall, you're with me.

513
00:33:15,031 --> 00:33:17,829
That's half time, start packing it up!

514
00:33:18,802 --> 00:33:21,669
Get back to the stargate,
quickly as you can. Go!

515
00:33:25,742 --> 00:33:28,472
- Gettin' hot, huh?
- Yeah, but it's a dry heat.

516
00:33:37,786 --> 00:33:39,845
All right, that's it,
we're out of here. Move.

517
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:45,483
Get back to the Gate Room. Double time!

518
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,791
- How we doing?
- We eat tonight.

519
00:33:50,866 --> 00:33:52,993
- Excellent. Get out of here.
- Pack it up.

520
00:33:54,303 --> 00:33:55,736
Come on, let's go.

521
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,701
All right, that's it, let's go!

522
00:34:13,588 --> 00:34:15,146
What do you think?

523
00:34:15,223 --> 00:34:16,656
I think it's not on our list.

524
00:34:21,095 --> 00:34:25,327
It could double the amount of weapons
we could bring online.

525
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:26,798
Do we even have time for this?

526
00:34:27,835 --> 00:34:29,530
Colonel, we've come across
a piece of equipment

527
00:34:29,604 --> 00:34:32,266
that could significantly increase
our weapons capability,

528
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,568
but we're up against the clock.

529
00:34:33,641 --> 00:34:35,973
<i>For that,
we should risk it!</i>

530
00:34:36,043 --> 00:34:37,374
For once, he agrees with me.

531
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:43,072
Okay, I'll go and I'll bring back
the proper tools.

532
00:34:43,151 --> 00:34:44,379
Be careful not to touch the damaged one.

533
00:34:45,086 --> 00:34:46,485
About 1000 volts running through that.

534
00:34:46,554 --> 00:34:47,714
Do you think I might know that?

535
00:35:05,438 --> 00:35:09,067
Didn't mean to sneak up on you. This is it?

536
00:35:09,142 --> 00:35:12,908
Yeah. The others took the parts
we had back to the Gate Room.

537
00:35:12,979 --> 00:35:16,779
My younger self is coming back to help,
but I don't want to wait for him.

538
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:18,147
You don't trust him either, huh?

539
00:35:20,086 --> 00:35:22,680
- So what went wrong?
- What are you talking about?

540
00:35:23,857 --> 00:35:25,518
Not that I think you would
kill them all deliberately.

541
00:35:25,592 --> 00:35:27,286
I tried to save them!

542
00:35:27,693 --> 00:35:29,593
You don't think I buy that story?

543
00:35:29,662 --> 00:35:33,291
Rush valiantly keeping the gate open
while the ship explodes all around him?

544
00:35:33,399 --> 00:35:34,593
I don't care what you think.

545
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,629
It wouldn't be the first time
you sabotaged the ship

546
00:35:36,702 --> 00:35:37,930
to make an ass out of me, would it?

547
00:35:38,003 --> 00:35:39,095
The last time we tried to dial Earth

548
00:35:39,171 --> 00:35:41,264
from inside a star comes to mind,
among others.

549
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,831
- So, what went wrong?
- The wormhole was unstable!

550
00:35:43,909 --> 00:35:45,467
I'm talking about what really happened.

551
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:47,136
Their blood is on your hands, not mine.

552
00:35:47,213 --> 00:35:50,205
They would all have made it home,
but you did something!

553
00:35:50,282 --> 00:35:51,772
I was trying to buy them some time!

554
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,011
Oh, and there's not a single person
left alive to confirm that...

555
00:35:54,086 --> 00:35:56,281
Get your hands off of me!
You're the coward!

556
00:35:56,355 --> 00:35:57,982
You're the one
who didn't believe in the mission!

557
00:35:58,057 --> 00:36:00,355
You're the one that killed them!

558
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:07,186
Oh, no.

559
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:13,529
Oh, no.

560
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:40,763
All right, right over here!

561
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:43,928
Hey, Rush, where's your other, uh...

562
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,400
He's found something
for the weapons systems.

563
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:46,458
- There's no time!
- We still have time.

564
00:36:46,536 --> 00:36:48,595
- I'm just going back to help.
- All right, I'll go with you!

565
00:36:48,672 --> 00:36:52,631
Dial the gate and keep it open for us.
T.J., get these people out of here.

566
00:36:53,777 --> 00:36:55,404
Don't stay too long!

567
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:58,039
All right, everybody, move out,
we're going to dial the gate!

568
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:00,682
They're dialing back.

569
00:37:01,218 --> 00:37:03,846
Good. That was fast.

570
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,444
I wasn't finished reporting,

571
00:37:05,522 --> 00:37:07,854
but when Colonel Telford found out
that we were still here,

572
00:37:07,924 --> 00:37:10,654
he insisted that he be allowed
to use the stones

573
00:37:10,727 --> 00:37:14,254
to switch with someone, preferably himself.

574
00:37:14,331 --> 00:37:15,423
That's weird.

575
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:17,524
Yeah, well, that can wait.
At least they know we're alive.

576
00:37:28,511 --> 00:37:29,773
Oh, no.

577
00:37:47,963 --> 00:37:49,487
Lieutenant Scott, where the hell are you?

578
00:37:49,565 --> 00:37:51,089
<i>Going after something
that's supposed to double</i>

579
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:52,395
<i>the weapons capability, sir.</i>

580
00:37:52,468 --> 00:37:56,199
Negative. You don't have time for that.
I need you to locate Colonel Telford.

581
00:37:56,272 --> 00:37:57,465
He's not answering his radio.

582
00:37:57,539 --> 00:37:59,973
Roger that, sir, we're
comin' right around...

583
00:38:01,543 --> 00:38:03,067
Scott, say again? You were cut off.

584
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,405
We found the Colonel, sir. He's dead.

585
00:38:13,955 --> 00:38:15,217
Where's Rush?

586
00:38:16,391 --> 00:38:18,916
He's right beside me.
I don't know where the other one is.

587
00:38:18,993 --> 00:38:20,085
I do.

588
00:38:20,729 --> 00:38:22,253
Hey, hey, Rush!

589
00:38:24,232 --> 00:38:26,029
Sir, Rush just ran off on me.

590
00:38:26,101 --> 00:38:27,932
<i>- Let him go.
- Sir!</i>

591
00:38:28,002 --> 00:38:29,765
You only have a few minutes
before the shield fails.

592
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:31,829
Let him go, that is an order, Lieutenant.

593
00:38:54,161 --> 00:38:55,458
It was an accident.

594
00:38:56,897 --> 00:39:00,890
I believe you, but they won't.

595
00:39:01,935 --> 00:39:03,027
No.

596
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:08,339
Tell me, when you, uh, dialed Earth,

597
00:39:10,144 --> 00:39:11,668
what really happened?

598
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,604
I told you what happened.

599
00:39:19,952 --> 00:39:24,651
And so now you're trying to decide
whether or not to sit in that chair.

600
00:39:24,724 --> 00:39:26,089
Well, wouldn't you, in my place?

601
00:39:28,327 --> 00:39:31,296
I'm not sure if even the knowledge
of the Ancients can help you now.

602
00:39:34,634 --> 00:39:37,398
Well, I really don't have anything
to lose at this point.

603
00:39:39,672 --> 00:39:41,333
Imagine what I could learn.

604
00:39:41,974 --> 00:39:43,498
Well, you won't have much time.

605
00:39:43,876 --> 00:39:47,505
Well, time's relative.
We've just proved that, haven't we?

606
00:39:50,115 --> 00:39:51,275
So, what are you waiting for?

607
00:39:53,385 --> 00:39:54,716
I need your help.

608
00:40:16,174 --> 00:40:17,505
Thank you.

609
00:40:18,443 --> 00:40:19,637
Goodbye.

610
00:40:56,146 --> 00:40:58,273
Come on, come on, come on!

611
00:41:18,468 --> 00:41:19,457
You're welcome.

612
00:41:21,404 --> 00:41:23,838
I'm okay, I'm okay.

613
00:41:27,043 --> 00:41:28,271
Nicholas.

614
00:41:29,012 --> 00:41:30,138
Yeah?

615
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:33,681
Where's the other Rush?

616
00:41:35,218 --> 00:41:37,846
- I don't know.
- You told Scott you knew where he went.

617
00:41:37,921 --> 00:41:40,355
I was wrong.
I went looking for him, couldn't find him.

618
00:41:40,423 --> 00:41:42,549
Maybe he decided to go down with his ship.

619
00:41:43,492 --> 00:41:44,652
That doesn't sound like me.

620
00:41:44,826 --> 00:41:48,728
Still, you must, uh...
You must be pleased about one thing.

621
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:49,821
What's that?

622
00:41:49,898 --> 00:41:52,662
Well, we can fix the ship,
get on with the mission.

623
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:56,930
Yeah, of course.

624
00:42:00,742 --> 00:42:02,710
Get on with the mission.

625
00:43:26,726 --> 00:43:27,715
English - US - SDH
