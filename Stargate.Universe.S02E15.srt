1
00:00:04,093 --> 00:00:08,189
<i>I may be on the verge of discovering
the true nature ofDestiny's mission.</i>

2
00:00:09,932 --> 00:00:12,924
<i>You've had control of this ship
the whole time!</i>

3
00:00:13,002 --> 00:00:14,401
Why wouldn't you tell anyone?

4
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,496
The Lucian Alliance is planning
an attack on Earth.

5
00:00:18,007 --> 00:00:21,033
<i>I killed Riley.
I suffocated him with my own hands.</i>

6
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,101
You are a good commander.

7
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:26,171
<i>There is no mission other
than getting these people home.</i>

8
00:00:26,315 --> 00:00:29,511
<i>It was never about going home, it's
about getting us to where we're going.</i>

9
00:00:29,618 --> 00:00:31,882
That is the mission.

10
00:00:32,454 --> 00:00:34,354
<i>Ginn was strangled by Simeon.</i>

11
00:00:34,422 --> 00:00:37,949
<i>And we received confirmation
that Dr. Perry died on Earth.</i>

12
00:00:38,026 --> 00:00:39,015
<i>I think we
have a connection.</i>

13
00:00:39,094 --> 00:00:41,562
<i>You're aboard the Destiny.
I'm Colonel Young. Who are you?</i>

14
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:42,719
I'm Ginn.

15
00:00:42,864 --> 00:00:45,799
If Ginn is in Chloe's body,
whose body is Chloe connected to?

16
00:00:45,867 --> 00:00:48,859
- Chloe?
- No, Amanda Perry.

17
00:00:49,304 --> 00:00:51,772
<i>I do have another idea.
The neural interface chair.</i>

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,637
<i>We can isolate each consciousness</i>

19
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:55,539
<i>and upload them into Destiny's
memory bank.</i>

20
00:00:56,611 --> 00:00:57,908
It worked.

21
00:00:58,046 --> 00:00:59,035
Thank you.

22
00:00:59,381 --> 00:01:01,110
<i>I know it's only temporary.</i>

23
00:01:01,182 --> 00:01:02,945
<i>But for now, it's
the best we can do.</i>

24
00:01:06,521 --> 00:01:08,682
Mr. Ambassador,

25
00:01:08,757 --> 00:01:12,454
when we first spoke of using
your planet's core as the power source

26
00:01:12,527 --> 00:01:16,861
to dial the nine chevron address,
it was a scientific mystery.

27
00:01:17,399 --> 00:01:19,127
Now it has become a necessity.

28
00:01:19,199 --> 00:01:20,689
It was always your intention
to send people.

29
00:01:20,768 --> 00:01:21,757
Not these people.

30
00:01:22,102 --> 00:01:23,626
Not so unprepared.

31
00:01:23,704 --> 00:01:27,003
If we could open a supply line
of equipment and relief personnel...

32
00:01:27,174 --> 00:01:29,904
- Mr. Woolsey...
- The planets with the required properties

33
00:01:29,977 --> 00:01:32,207
to do this are exceedingly rare.

34
00:01:32,646 --> 00:01:35,206
What's more,
99% of the work is already done.

35
00:01:35,282 --> 00:01:38,308
Your facility draws power from the core,
the Stargate is in place...

36
00:01:38,385 --> 00:01:39,716
Twice this has been attempted,

37
00:01:39,787 --> 00:01:43,154
and twice the planets were destroyed
by a catastrophic chain reaction.

38
00:01:43,223 --> 00:01:46,283
The overload at Icarus was a direct result
of the enemy bombardment.

39
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,349
- In the second case...
- We acknowledge

40
00:01:47,428 --> 00:01:48,986
there were mitigating factors
in both cases.

41
00:01:49,063 --> 00:01:53,966
Nevertheless, our scientists believe Dr.
Rush's solution is inherently dangerous.

42
00:01:54,034 --> 00:01:57,663
Which is why we asked you
to come here, sir. We have a new solution.

43
00:02:06,981 --> 00:02:09,540
Ambassador Ovirda, Dr. Rodney McKay.

44
00:02:10,383 --> 00:02:14,012
Ambassador, gentlemen.
This will just take a second to boot up.

45
00:02:14,287 --> 00:02:15,584
There isn't anywhere I
can plug in, is there?

46
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:17,481
Ah, it'll be fine.

47
00:02:24,263 --> 00:02:26,493
Knight to queen's bishop five.

48
00:02:38,211 --> 00:02:40,076
Move it yourself.

49
00:02:41,447 --> 00:02:42,812
Very funny.

50
00:02:44,717 --> 00:02:45,706
You're not concentrating.

51
00:02:45,885 --> 00:02:48,649
Well, I couldn't beat you
when you were a flesh and blood person.

52
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:49,779
What chance do I have now?

53
00:02:50,823 --> 00:02:51,881
I'm a person, Nick.

54
00:02:52,091 --> 00:02:54,286
Of course you are.

55
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,457
I mean... What I meant to say,
what I should have said,

56
00:02:58,764 --> 00:03:00,322
is that you're more than that.

57
00:03:00,932 --> 00:03:02,126
I'm still me.

58
00:03:02,768 --> 00:03:03,928
What are you doing right now?

59
00:03:04,236 --> 00:03:05,396
I'm here with you.

60
00:03:05,704 --> 00:03:06,693
And?

61
00:03:08,473 --> 00:03:12,807
And analyzing the structure
you found in the database,

62
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:15,711
and accessing the ship's sensors
so I can study the nearest...

63
00:03:15,781 --> 00:03:17,271
Wow.

64
00:03:20,752 --> 00:03:23,277
Okay. You have a point.

65
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:26,856
So much more
than a flesh and blood person.

66
00:03:27,826 --> 00:03:30,056
Then why is that the only thing
I dream about?

67
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:36,690
I have the same dream, and you're in it.

68
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:48,100
There is a way.

69
00:04:02,293 --> 00:04:03,624
Okay, good to go.

70
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:07,790
Sorry. Now, I'm sure we're all familiar
with the old adage,

71
00:04:07,865 --> 00:04:10,095
- "It's all in the algorithm," so...
- Doctor.

72
00:04:11,035 --> 00:04:12,764
- I'm going to stop you there.
- All I said was "so."

73
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:13,826
I'm not a scientist.

74
00:04:13,904 --> 00:04:15,132
No, that's not a problem.
I dumbed it down.

75
00:04:15,372 --> 00:04:16,430
There's no point in wasting our time.

76
00:04:16,774 --> 00:04:18,435
No, I can talk very, very fast.

77
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:19,669
Let me ask you this.

78
00:04:19,743 --> 00:04:21,142
If our roles were reversed,

79
00:04:21,212 --> 00:04:24,113
would you be so blithe
as to put Earth's population at risk?

80
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,307
There's no risk. That's the point.

81
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:28,442
Hopefully once our own scientists have
had a chance to go over your work,

82
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,645
they'll reach the same conclusion.

83
00:04:29,787 --> 00:04:30,776
There's no time for that.

84
00:04:31,388 --> 00:04:33,322
<i>- Colonel...
- The Lucian Alliance wants Destiny.</i>

85
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,982
They know that your facility
can get them there

86
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,119
and you know damn well
that they will not take no for an answer.

87
00:04:38,328 --> 00:04:40,592
There's an excellent argument
to dismantle the facility altogether.

88
00:04:40,763 --> 00:04:43,561
Don't think that that will stop them.
They will move in faster.

89
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,258
<i>They will do anything to
get to the Destiny,</i>

90
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:47,997
and won't give a damn if they blow up
your planet in the process.

91
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:49,402
Then don't let them.

92
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:54,003
If we were allowed to show you that
Dr. McKay's dialing solution is safe.

93
00:04:54,077 --> 00:04:56,671
That is the price of your protection
from the Lucian Alliance?

94
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,845
As a life-long practitioner of diplomacy,

95
00:04:58,915 --> 00:05:03,113
you must understand that sovereign states
act in their own interest.

96
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:06,049
The defense of a supply line, for example.

97
00:05:07,023 --> 00:05:08,115
For example.

98
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:13,825
If and when our scientists
reach the same conclusion as Dr. McKay...

99
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:16,331
No, no, no, it could take months for them
to understand the science.

100
00:05:16,432 --> 00:05:18,263
Then that is how long
you will have to wait.

101
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:20,325
The Alliance won't be as patient.

102
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,032
I have no choice
but to hope that you're wrong.

103
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:27,504
Good day, gentlemen.

104
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,346
The Lucian Alliance got to them.

105
00:05:39,688 --> 00:05:41,019
He just proved that to me.

106
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,625
We have to move.

107
00:05:48,864 --> 00:05:50,092
He didn't even look at my work.

108
00:05:50,165 --> 00:05:51,962
Because he wouldn't have understood it
in the first place.

109
00:05:52,034 --> 00:05:54,468
You saw my presentation.
A cat could understand it.

110
00:05:54,536 --> 00:05:56,299
And he knows
their government will only listen

111
00:05:56,371 --> 00:05:58,430
to the assurances of their own experts.

112
00:05:58,507 --> 00:06:00,168
We would do the same.

113
00:06:00,242 --> 00:06:01,937
They've already made a deal
with the Lucian Alliance.

114
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,307
I seriously doubt that.

115
00:06:03,412 --> 00:06:04,845
I can prove it.

116
00:06:05,647 --> 00:06:08,309
- David, how'd it go?
- Pretty much like I expected.

117
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,782
Dr. McKay,
your reputation precedes you.

118
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,409
Some of it even good.

119
00:06:12,888 --> 00:06:15,321
- And you are?
Sorry, communication stones.

120
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:17,550
<i>This is actually Colonel Young,
commander of the Destiny.</i>

121
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,252
You know Woolsey.

122
00:06:20,027 --> 00:06:21,995
You said something about proof?

123
00:06:22,063 --> 00:06:24,054
Not exactly, but close enough.

124
00:06:24,498 --> 00:06:27,729
We've parked a dozen or so
listening satellites around Langara.

125
00:06:27,802 --> 00:06:28,894
The communications are encrypted

126
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,870
in a Lucian Alliance cipher
we haven't broken,

127
00:06:30,938 --> 00:06:32,496
but there's enough back and forth
to suggest

128
00:06:32,573 --> 00:06:34,700
that some sort of negotiation
has been going on for some time.

129
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:36,306
Does the IOA know this?

130
00:06:36,377 --> 00:06:37,776
General O'Neill briefed the chairman

131
00:06:37,845 --> 00:06:40,177
and the president this morning
in an emergency meeting.

132
00:06:40,248 --> 00:06:42,648
We are in an undeclared war
with the Alliance.

133
00:06:42,984 --> 00:06:45,179
Now, if the Langarans have already sided
with them, they can launch

134
00:06:45,253 --> 00:06:47,744
<i>another attack on Destiny
at almost any point.</i>

135
00:06:47,922 --> 00:06:49,219
Without the benefit of my solution.

136
00:06:49,924 --> 00:06:51,551
Which would make
dialing the ninth chevron

137
00:06:51,626 --> 00:06:53,287
a hell of a lot more dangerous
for the Langarans.

138
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:55,955
So we're protecting them from themselves,
is that it?

139
00:06:56,264 --> 00:06:58,323
If that's how you want to put it, sure.

140
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:00,128
The General's authorized
a mission to Langara.

141
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:01,190
What sort of mission?

142
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:03,634
We're calling it a "proof of concept,"
but before we get into that,

143
00:07:03,703 --> 00:07:05,261
we'll need McKay
to run through his presentation.

144
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:06,965
- Oh, okay.
- Not here.

145
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,814
Who's this?

146
00:07:21,888 --> 00:07:23,378
That's a good question. Where's Rush?

147
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:26,448
He sent Mr. Brody in his place.
He said you wouldn't care.

148
00:07:26,726 --> 00:07:28,421
Well, I don't. Doesn't mean
he can do whatever he wants.

149
00:07:28,495 --> 00:07:29,519
What's wrong?

150
00:07:29,596 --> 00:07:31,996
Rush was supposed to switch with you
and go over your data on Earth.

151
00:07:32,065 --> 00:07:33,464
- I thought I was here to talk to Rush.
- No, no, no,

152
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:34,522
you're here to talk to Eli.

153
00:07:34,601 --> 00:07:36,228
You convince him, you've convinced me.

154
00:07:36,603 --> 00:07:38,161
- Lieutenant, would you mind?
- Yes, sir.

155
00:07:38,538 --> 00:07:39,937
I'll take care of it.

156
00:07:40,006 --> 00:07:41,837
Rush, this is Young. Where are you?

157
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,637
- I'm up here.
- Right, of course.

158
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,873
We met at Stargate Command.
It's Vanessa, right?

159
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:47,935
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

160
00:07:48,581 --> 00:07:50,776
- After you.
- No, ladies first.

161
00:07:54,186 --> 00:07:55,380
I'll go.

162
00:07:57,489 --> 00:07:58,649
Hey.

163
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:02,021
He ran into me, literally, a while ago
in a hurry somewhere.

164
00:08:02,094 --> 00:08:03,083
He didn't say anything?

165
00:08:03,162 --> 00:08:05,062
He said to tell you
he was taking the day off.

166
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,030
- What does that mean?
- That's what I said.

167
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:08,930
- We just found him.
- His vitals are stable.

168
00:08:09,001 --> 00:08:11,196
There's some kind of program running
that I've never seen before.

169
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,828
Don't ask 'cause I don't got a clue.

170
00:08:12,905 --> 00:08:14,532
Haven't you heard? He's taking the day off.

171
00:08:14,606 --> 00:08:17,336
Looks more like he's taking a nap!
I'm reading delta waves.

172
00:08:17,843 --> 00:08:19,970
Stage four sleep. Very deep.

173
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:22,479
So now I say, "Wake the bastard up,"
and you tell me it's dangerous.

174
00:08:23,182 --> 00:08:24,171
Well, it is.

175
00:08:24,249 --> 00:08:27,184
All right, well, let's find out what the
hell he's doing, and report back to me.

176
00:08:30,656 --> 00:08:34,490
You are in an immersive
simulation program.

177
00:08:35,661 --> 00:08:37,652
<i>It's already in the
Destiny's database.</i>

178
00:08:37,996 --> 00:08:39,827
In fact, some of you have
already experienced it.

179
00:08:39,898 --> 00:08:42,229
- Colonel Young's no-win scenario.
- Hmm.

180
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:51,071
It was already so capable
of hyper-realistic sensory input,

181
00:08:52,276 --> 00:08:56,303
all I had to do was find a way
that we could experience it together.

182
00:08:57,382 --> 00:08:59,680
And that's where the chair comes in.

183
00:08:59,751 --> 00:09:03,312
In a way, you're outside
of your physical body right now.

184
00:09:05,022 --> 00:09:07,217
This would've been no fun at all
if it was only in your head.

185
00:09:07,592 --> 00:09:09,685
This way we can feel each other's touch.

186
00:09:13,898 --> 00:09:18,528
You must have had to put in
some kind of conditions

187
00:09:18,603 --> 00:09:20,662
in order for the scenario to play out.

188
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:23,505
That was the easy part.

189
00:09:23,574 --> 00:09:26,441
The parameters are so simple that you
should be able to come and go as you wish.

190
00:09:26,677 --> 00:09:29,669
So it's just the two of us, then,
in our own little world.

191
00:09:30,248 --> 00:09:33,705
We have the whole matrix of the ship
to ourselves.

192
00:09:34,451 --> 00:09:38,285
I think we could even take a shuttle
somewhere if we really wanted to.

193
00:09:38,355 --> 00:09:41,950
Oh, really?
Well, maybe we'll try that sometime.

194
00:09:43,794 --> 00:09:45,591
- Not now.
- Definitely not now.

195
00:09:53,003 --> 00:09:54,732
Greer, are you nuts?

196
00:09:54,805 --> 00:09:57,103
You just donated a damn kidney.

197
00:09:57,207 --> 00:09:58,765
I just needed some exercise.

198
00:09:58,842 --> 00:10:02,471
There you are!
Sorry, Colonel, he snuck out.

199
00:10:02,546 --> 00:10:04,480
Listen to me, Ronald,
you're no good to me dead.

200
00:10:04,548 --> 00:10:06,379
I need you to get back to the infirmary.

201
00:10:07,751 --> 00:10:08,740
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

202
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:10,252
Yes, sir.

203
00:10:12,355 --> 00:10:14,118
No, no, no. See, this is where
you are completely wrong.

204
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:15,556
It is impossible to make that deduction

205
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:16,956
because it falls outside
of the boundary conditions.

206
00:10:17,027 --> 00:10:18,619
This changes the boundary conditions!

207
00:10:18,695 --> 00:10:19,753
It doesn't work that way!

208
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,356
If you make the change, yes, it does!
Read the writing on the wall, man.

209
00:10:23,432 --> 00:10:26,128
Listen, kid, one semester at MIT
does not make you...

210
00:10:26,202 --> 00:10:28,466
Gentlemen! I take it there are problems
with this?

211
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:29,660
What?

212
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:32,064
He thinks we're talking about your
nine chevron dialing solution.

213
00:10:32,141 --> 00:10:34,541
No, no, no, no, no, we've moved on.

214
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:35,838
Very, very bright, this kid.

215
00:10:35,911 --> 00:10:38,209
I mean, in many ways
he reminds me of me at that age.

216
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,214
Of course, I was carrying
around a lot less...

217
00:10:40,282 --> 00:10:42,648
- Hair?
So, it'll work?

218
00:10:43,385 --> 00:10:46,650
- Yeah, yeah. I wish I'd thought of it.
- Thank you.

219
00:10:46,922 --> 00:10:48,753
Great. Just to be clear,
without blowing up the planet?

220
00:10:49,091 --> 00:10:52,458
- I'd say the odds of that are...
- Statistically zero.

221
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:54,518
Good.

222
00:10:54,597 --> 00:10:56,861
Now, Rush's original calculations
were sound, don't get me wrong.

223
00:10:56,932 --> 00:10:59,332
It's just that he was using a trinary
instead of a quad base,

224
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:00,629
- which threw off...
- I don't really care,

225
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:02,762
just as long as Eli says we're good to go.

226
00:11:03,272 --> 00:11:04,261
Yeah. Yeah, we're good.

227
00:11:04,507 --> 00:11:06,168
- Let's go.
- I just got here!

228
00:11:06,242 --> 00:11:07,300
Well, you can come back anytime.

229
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:10,674
In fact, we pull this off,
you can come back in person.

230
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:14,148
- This is not over, mister.
- Bring it!

231
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,252
Brody bought McKay's solution.
- Of course he did.

232
00:11:20,321 --> 00:11:23,222
Look, he didn't eat any citrus
when he was in my body, did he?

233
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,451
'Cause I am not feeling well.

234
00:11:24,526 --> 00:11:26,824
I assume this means you're going ahead
with your mission.

235
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,192
I don't see that there's a choice.

236
00:11:28,363 --> 00:11:30,126
Of course there is!

237
00:11:30,265 --> 00:11:33,166
Clearly the Alliance is putting
something substantial on the table.

238
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,498
If we go to them with some sort
of a peace offering of our own...

239
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,971
General O'Neill believes the Alliance
will move in a matter of days,

240
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,134
whether they're invited or not
by the Langaran Government.

241
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:44,371
He also believes the Langarans
would prefer siding with us

242
00:11:44,445 --> 00:11:46,345
- if given the choice.
- I agree wholeheartedly.

243
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,506
Well, the goal of our mission

244
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:50,949
is to make that choice easier by proving
that Dr. McKay's solution is safe.

245
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:52,008
Oh, it's safe!

246
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,678
Our secondary goal would be to determine

247
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,188
whether or not they've already made a deal

248
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,621
- with the other side.
- And if we find that out?

249
00:11:56,691 --> 00:11:58,920
Well, then we will act accordingly.

250
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:02,726
<i>The Lucian Alliance is not going to be
allowed to attack Destiny again.</i>

251
00:12:05,165 --> 00:12:06,792
I think I can speak for
both of us when I say

252
00:12:06,867 --> 00:12:10,564
that if your intention is
to take their facility by force,

253
00:12:10,637 --> 00:12:11,661
we'll have no part of it.

254
00:12:12,272 --> 00:12:13,534
No, of course not, Mr. Woolsey.

255
00:12:14,141 --> 00:12:17,269
We're going to give them a peace offering.

256
00:12:22,382 --> 00:12:23,371
T.J., any change?

257
00:12:24,084 --> 00:12:27,212
I don't think he's asleep.
He's in something closer to a coma.

258
00:12:27,287 --> 00:12:29,050
- What's wrong with this guy?
You know what, T. J?

259
00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:31,647
This timing sucks, but Scott and I,
we've got to do this thing.

260
00:12:31,725 --> 00:12:34,717
You're in charge. Keep a defense
team in the Gate Room at all times.

261
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,729
- Yes, sir.
- I also need you to check in on Greer.

262
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,128
- I ran into him in the corridor this morning.
- What?

263
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:40,189
- Yeah, he didn't look good.
- No, he shouldn't be walking around.

264
00:12:40,267 --> 00:12:41,529
Right.

265
00:12:42,736 --> 00:12:44,067
Aside from "taking the day off,"

266
00:12:44,137 --> 00:12:46,628
did Rush say anything that
might give us a clue as to why he did this?

267
00:12:47,107 --> 00:12:48,403
- Not to me.
Maybe he couldn't bring

268
00:12:48,474 --> 00:12:50,499
himself to see how McKay
improved on his work.

269
00:12:50,576 --> 00:12:53,204
Look, I'm not saying he doesn't have an ego
the size of a bus,

270
00:12:53,512 --> 00:12:56,606
but Rush would kill
to bring people and supplies from Earth.

271
00:12:56,682 --> 00:13:00,482
So, what was so important?

272
00:13:01,053 --> 00:13:03,715
I'm sure he planned to tell me
at our next heart-to-heart.

273
00:13:05,024 --> 00:13:06,548
Just do me a favor, get him on his feet

274
00:13:06,626 --> 00:13:08,526
so I can knock him on his ass
when I'm back.

275
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,193
Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you.

276
00:13:16,268 --> 00:13:18,395
Does it have to be so hot in here?

277
00:13:18,471 --> 00:13:21,497
It's not. You have a fever, which means
you're fighting another infection.

278
00:13:22,008 --> 00:13:25,136
Good to know. I'll fight harder.

279
00:13:25,978 --> 00:13:28,538
I wish it worked that way.

280
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,978
It does.

281
00:13:32,051 --> 00:13:33,143
Here.

282
00:13:37,656 --> 00:13:44,084
See, I feel better already.
How's Volker?

283
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,328
Great, for a guy who's sporting
someone else's kidney.

284
00:13:48,433 --> 00:13:51,163
I really didn't expect you
to be the one who got sick.

285
00:13:51,236 --> 00:13:52,828
Better me than him.

286
00:13:54,172 --> 00:13:57,300
- Why's that?
- 'Cause I'm strong.

287
00:13:59,544 --> 00:14:00,841
Yeah, you are.

288
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,005
But no more walking around, okay?
You need to sleep.

289
00:14:05,984 --> 00:14:07,349
That's an order.

290
00:14:09,054 --> 00:14:10,043
Yes, ma'am.

291
00:14:16,828 --> 00:14:19,353
I got nothing. You?

292
00:14:19,431 --> 00:14:23,561
There's hardly any brain activity at all,
it's like he's not even...

293
00:14:26,704 --> 00:14:28,569
Go back in the logs as far as you can.

294
00:14:29,173 --> 00:14:31,038
His present physical state
has nothing to do with this.

295
00:14:33,143 --> 00:14:34,269
Holy crap.

296
00:14:34,344 --> 00:14:37,108
Yeah. That is one hell of an upload.

297
00:14:37,181 --> 00:14:39,615
<i>Over 900 terabytes were transferred
into Destiny's memory.</i>

298
00:14:40,517 --> 00:14:42,109
Eli, what am I looking at?

299
00:14:42,786 --> 00:14:46,722
The complete and unabridged
consciousness of one Nicholas Rush.

300
00:14:48,692 --> 00:14:50,353
<i>Feels strange with
no one else around.</i>

301
00:14:51,328 --> 00:14:54,491
Thanks a lot.

302
00:14:54,565 --> 00:14:58,092
You know what I mean.
It must be different for you, too.

303
00:14:58,869 --> 00:15:01,895
Yeah, it's hard to explain.

304
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,834
I mean, there are hours
when I feel oblivious to the fact

305
00:15:05,909 --> 00:15:07,638
- that there are even other people aboard.
- Yeah?

306
00:15:07,711 --> 00:15:12,512
Like when I'm looking outside of the ship,
taking in the galaxy around us,

307
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:16,248
and then at other times I can pore
through data in fractions of a second

308
00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:18,287
that would take me hours
to read if I was...

309
00:15:19,655 --> 00:15:21,247
If you were a...

310
00:15:22,492 --> 00:15:23,481
What, a person, you mean?

311
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,051
I much prefer being here with you.

312
00:15:26,496 --> 00:15:28,487
I mean, physically here.

313
00:15:29,932 --> 00:15:34,562
Existing as consciousness is lonely.

314
00:15:36,105 --> 00:15:39,074
Now, you needn't be lonely ever again.

315
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,904
You have no idea how happy it makes me
to hear you say that.

316
00:15:48,217 --> 00:15:50,185
In fact,

317
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:55,748
<i>if there was a way for me to interact
with Destiny's real systems,</i>

318
00:15:56,993 --> 00:15:59,188
we could spend even more time together.

319
00:15:59,262 --> 00:16:00,854
But we can't.

320
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,989
The system is isolated.

321
00:16:03,065 --> 00:16:07,660
It wouldn't be much of a simulation if it
had real-world repercussions, would it?

322
00:16:07,736 --> 00:16:09,636
We'd best let Eli and Ginn know
for their sake.

323
00:16:10,806 --> 00:16:13,775
For now is it okay if
we keep it our secret?

324
00:16:13,842 --> 00:16:15,434
Yeah, of course.

325
00:16:17,712 --> 00:16:18,701
I really need to go now.

326
00:16:20,816 --> 00:16:22,408
Do you have to?

327
00:16:23,218 --> 00:16:25,584
Well, for one, I've been away long enough

328
00:16:25,654 --> 00:16:27,645
for Colonel Young
to start getting hysterical.

329
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,288
And another is, I have to work.

330
00:16:33,328 --> 00:16:37,856
So, is there a door somewhere,
or do I just click my heels together?

331
00:16:40,068 --> 00:16:42,036
It's even easier than that.

332
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:53,812
All you need to do is sit, close your eyes,
and when you open them, you'll be back.

333
00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:55,006
Yeah!

334
00:16:55,216 --> 00:16:59,653
And the shouting and the pointing
and the demanding of answers shall begin.

335
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,312
I cannot wait.

336
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:06,115
But you'll be back soon, won't you?

337
00:17:07,962 --> 00:17:11,921
Well, you can always come visit me
in the real world.

338
00:17:17,938 --> 00:17:20,839
I know it's not the same thing, but...

339
00:17:20,908 --> 00:17:24,207
Hey, at least you know I love you
for your mind as well as your body.

340
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:30,976
Yes.

341
00:17:32,453 --> 00:17:34,250
Go, sit.

342
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:40,688
- I'll come say good night to you later.
- I'll see you then.

343
00:17:56,643 --> 00:18:01,205
Amanda, it didn't work.

344
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,404
Defensive positions!

345
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,258
- I am unarmed.
Mr. Woolsey!

346
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:49,357
You are not expected.

347
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:52,158
I am here at the request of my government,

348
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:56,360
bearing gifts for both the ambassador
and your chief administrator.

349
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,764
Should I call him for you, sir?

350
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:02,607
Not yet. What sort of gifts?

351
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,069
Symbols of our friendship.

352
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:09,412
Artifacts carved by the Ancients
themselves over a million years ago.

353
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,715
I would prefer it if you didn't.

354
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,775
You don't think I would allow you
to give something like this

355
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:15,877
to Administrator Halpurn

356
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:17,512
without looking it over first.

357
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:20,590
All right.

358
00:19:27,164 --> 00:19:30,759
- Well, Captain? Is it acceptable?
- Looks fine to me.

359
00:19:31,135 --> 00:19:33,296
Then may I present it to the administrator?

360
00:19:33,371 --> 00:19:36,340
- Absolutely.
- Excellent. I know the way.

361
00:19:44,882 --> 00:19:46,076
Ahhh!

362
00:19:46,884 --> 00:19:49,148
<i>- What is this?
- You're on board the Destiny.</i>

363
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,653
I promise you, you won't be harmed,

364
00:19:50,721 --> 00:19:53,918
and you will be returned
to your own body shortly.

365
00:20:04,035 --> 00:20:06,094
Woolsey! What are you doing here?

366
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,159
He's brought a gift, sir.

367
00:20:07,238 --> 00:20:08,262
For you and the ambassador.

368
00:20:08,806 --> 00:20:10,467
I've already inspected it,
I'm sure it's harmless.

369
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:11,867
Captain, what you should have done is

370
00:20:11,941 --> 00:20:14,432
instruct Mr. Woolsey
to return home immediately.

371
00:20:14,511 --> 00:20:18,675
At least read the inscription
on the bottom of the stone. Please.

372
00:20:23,486 --> 00:20:25,113
How is this possible?

373
00:20:25,655 --> 00:20:26,644
That I can't tell you, sir.

374
00:20:28,058 --> 00:20:29,457
Just stay calm.

375
00:20:29,893 --> 00:20:31,656
This shouldn't take too long.

376
00:20:34,998 --> 00:20:36,397
We pulling this off?

377
00:20:36,933 --> 00:20:38,798
- So far so good, sir.
What the hell am I wearing...

378
00:20:38,868 --> 00:20:41,598
SG-1 teams four and five
should be arriving in five minutes.

379
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:44,871
Well, let's go welcome
them to our facility.

380
00:20:53,016 --> 00:20:54,347
It should have worked.

381
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:57,352
Well, there's no point
in panicking just yet.

382
00:20:58,321 --> 00:20:59,345
Maybe you should try it again.

383
00:21:00,657 --> 00:21:01,645
I have tried.

384
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:06,523
Maybe I can shut the simulation down
another way.

385
00:21:06,595 --> 00:21:07,857
No, no, Amanda,
that's a really good thought,

386
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,591
but you can't do that from in here.

387
00:21:09,665 --> 00:21:13,328
This system's isolated.
You told me so yourself.

388
00:21:13,402 --> 00:21:18,430
In fact, nothing you're doing at the moment
is having any effect whatsoever.

389
00:21:20,676 --> 00:21:21,938
I don't know
how I could have been so stupid.

390
00:21:23,011 --> 00:21:26,105
Well, now, that's one thing you're not.

391
00:21:26,882 --> 00:21:27,906
It's probably just a glitch.

392
00:21:29,251 --> 00:21:35,281
Probably, but I can't leave,
and you can't fix it from here, so...

393
00:21:35,824 --> 00:21:38,156
Right.

394
00:21:38,961 --> 00:21:39,950
You'll be all right?

395
00:21:40,996 --> 00:21:42,793
I'll be fine. You go.

396
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:53,666
Ginn! Ginn!

397
00:21:53,741 --> 00:21:55,971
Eli! She's in the ship's memory.

398
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:58,510
It's not like she can hear you
any better or worse out there.

399
00:21:58,579 --> 00:21:59,705
Then why isn't she answering me?

400
00:21:59,981 --> 00:22:01,676
Why are you so sure she can help us?

401
00:22:01,749 --> 00:22:03,478
I think I know what Rush is doing.

402
00:22:03,985 --> 00:22:06,419
Because Ginn and I had the same idea,
and I think they talk.

403
00:22:07,221 --> 00:22:09,018
- What?
- In their Ascension research,

404
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,182
the Ancients experimented

405
00:22:10,258 --> 00:22:12,453
with the transfer of human consciousness
all the time.

406
00:22:12,527 --> 00:22:14,620
- I mean, it's how the stones work, right?
- We have no clue.

407
00:22:14,729 --> 00:22:16,663
Why would he do that?

408
00:22:19,133 --> 00:22:21,795
Okay, so this is a little...

409
00:22:24,172 --> 00:22:28,040
Night before last,
Ginn was visiting me in my quarters.

410
00:22:28,109 --> 00:22:31,442
We were talking, and I said something like,

411
00:22:31,512 --> 00:22:33,173
"Wouldn't it be great
if we could do more than talk?"

412
00:22:33,548 --> 00:22:36,415
- You mean actual physical contact.
- Yeah.

413
00:22:38,219 --> 00:22:41,153
- Oh, you mean...
- Yes, yes, that's what I meant.

414
00:22:41,221 --> 00:22:46,056
Honestly, I was just thinking out loud,
but the suggestion did not go over well.

415
00:22:46,126 --> 00:22:47,115
Well, Eli, she just died

416
00:22:47,194 --> 00:22:49,856
and had her consciousness uploaded
to the ship's memory,

417
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,454
and you're just thinking
about getting your...

418
00:22:51,531 --> 00:22:54,557
What? No! No, no, no, no.

419
00:22:54,634 --> 00:22:55,828
That part she was all for.

420
00:22:57,704 --> 00:22:58,693
Then why?

421
00:23:01,608 --> 00:23:04,338
- Because she said it would be dangerous.
- Why?

422
00:23:05,278 --> 00:23:08,145
You don't think uploading a human
consciousness and back again

423
00:23:08,215 --> 00:23:10,342
is a little dangerous?

424
00:23:15,088 --> 00:23:20,082
When I tried to talk her into it anyway,
she got mad, or depressed,

425
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,721
or some combination of the two,
and I haven't seen her since.

426
00:23:26,366 --> 00:23:30,301
I'm sure the discoveries we make will be
of great benefit to both of our worlds.

427
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:32,303
Well, the ambassador and I
couldn't agree more.

428
00:23:33,205 --> 00:23:35,196
We're happy to help in any way we can.

429
00:23:35,274 --> 00:23:37,469
Our people will be dialing in momentarily.

430
00:23:37,543 --> 00:23:38,737
Of course.

431
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:42,312
We have agreed

432
00:23:42,381 --> 00:23:47,318
to attempt dialing the Stargate's
nine chevron address immediately.

433
00:23:48,153 --> 00:23:54,023
This will be done to prove the viability
and the safety of such a connection

434
00:23:54,693 --> 00:23:58,424
so that we will be able
to provide ongoing support to their people

435
00:23:59,198 --> 00:24:00,859
on the other side.

436
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,937
Now, I am confident that
there is no danger. Captain?

437
00:24:08,207 --> 00:24:10,698
A team from Earth will be arriving shortly.

438
00:24:10,776 --> 00:24:14,303
We will give them
our complete support and cooperation.

439
00:24:14,847 --> 00:24:16,508
Stow your weapons.

440
00:24:16,815 --> 00:24:19,044
These people are allies.

441
00:24:20,151 --> 00:24:22,415
- Dismissed!
- Captain, what's going on?

442
00:24:25,223 --> 00:24:27,919
Well, I overheard them.
They've offered to share in everything.

443
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,387
Information, technology...

444
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,190
The administrator said drawing
that much power could overload the core,

445
00:24:32,664 --> 00:24:34,859
- rip open the planet's crust.
- Yeah, he's good.

446
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:36,561
What?

447
00:24:37,535 --> 00:24:39,264
He was bargaining.

448
00:24:44,676 --> 00:24:46,109
I'm sorry I was gone so long.

449
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:49,179
I've been having quite
the existential time of it, actually.

450
00:24:49,247 --> 00:24:52,944
Trying to perceive the difference
between this place and the real world,

451
00:24:53,184 --> 00:24:55,982
and if there is one, well,
I haven't found it.

452
00:24:58,389 --> 00:24:59,515
So you'll still come back, then?

453
00:25:00,325 --> 00:25:02,054
Well, I have to go away first
in order to come back.

454
00:25:03,094 --> 00:25:04,686
Well, that shouldn't be a problem anymore.

455
00:25:05,363 --> 00:25:06,830
Never a doubt.

456
00:25:08,065 --> 00:25:09,862
What was the problem?

457
00:25:10,901 --> 00:25:13,597
Actually, it was Ginn.

458
00:25:14,071 --> 00:25:16,539
Ginn? What has she got
to do with this, then?

459
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:20,140
I don't think she approves of this.

460
00:25:20,243 --> 00:25:22,074
- None of her bloody business.
- I know.

461
00:25:23,013 --> 00:25:27,109
But somehow her disapproval
manifested itself in keeping you here.

462
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:35,019
- Colonel Telford, gentlemen, welcome.
- McKay.

463
00:25:35,425 --> 00:25:36,653
Dr. Rodney McKay.

464
00:25:40,797 --> 00:25:42,094
Right.

465
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,931
With your permission, Administrator,
we'll get started.

466
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:48,596
The facility is at your disposal.

467
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:50,228
McKay, put us to work.

468
00:25:50,741 --> 00:25:53,369
Right, you and your team check
to make sure the power relays

469
00:25:53,443 --> 00:25:55,673
are still connected to the Stargate
while I hook up

470
00:25:55,746 --> 00:25:58,305
their woefully antiquated excuse
for a mainframe.

471
00:26:02,985 --> 00:26:05,545
I want somebody
on every entrance of this building.

472
00:26:05,621 --> 00:26:06,610
It's a big building, sir.

473
00:26:06,989 --> 00:26:09,787
Well, use their own people if you have to.

474
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,662
Should we have another go, then?

475
00:26:30,546 --> 00:26:31,672
Bye.

476
00:26:32,148 --> 00:26:33,479
We'll see.

477
00:26:49,197 --> 00:26:50,357
He's back, he's back!

478
00:26:50,432 --> 00:26:52,229
There's no need to shout. They can see me.

479
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,790
What the hell were you thinking?

480
00:26:53,868 --> 00:26:55,927
I thinking I'm rather hungry.
How long have I been away?

481
00:26:56,004 --> 00:26:57,596
Almost 12 hours.

482
00:26:58,473 --> 00:26:59,462
That seems about right.

483
00:26:59,908 --> 00:27:02,342
If you're going to do something
like this, you should tell someone.

484
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:03,399
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

485
00:27:03,478 --> 00:27:04,536
Young is pretty pissed!

486
00:27:04,612 --> 00:27:05,943
Yeah, well, he can shout at me later.

487
00:27:06,014 --> 00:27:07,948
How could you be so blasé about this?

488
00:27:08,016 --> 00:27:09,040
You could have died in there.

489
00:27:09,117 --> 00:27:11,915
You can shout at me
on the way to the mess if you like.

490
00:27:17,292 --> 00:27:18,953
I don't believe it.

491
00:27:19,027 --> 00:27:21,928
Amanda said it was some kind of
subconscious act of disapproval.

492
00:27:22,864 --> 00:27:24,422
Ginn would never hurt anyone.

493
00:27:24,499 --> 00:27:26,865
It doesn't matter anyway. I'm back.

494
00:27:28,102 --> 00:27:29,296
What was it like?

495
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:39,902
Entirely personal.

496
00:27:45,352 --> 00:27:47,081
We're not going to be able
to keep up this charade forever.

497
00:27:47,154 --> 00:27:48,143
How long is this gonna take?

498
00:27:48,222 --> 00:27:49,484
I gave you my best guess in the briefing.

499
00:27:49,556 --> 00:27:51,387
You also said you'd reassess
once we got here.

500
00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:54,120
Well, the facility is already drawing
power from the naquadria core,

501
00:27:54,194 --> 00:27:55,855
which speeds things up considerably.

502
00:27:55,996 --> 00:27:58,487
On the other hand,
this is more or less 1940s technology,

503
00:27:58,565 --> 00:28:00,032
which can slow things down.

504
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,762
Then again, there's the "They don't
build things like they used to" factor.

505
00:28:02,836 --> 00:28:04,531
One hour or two, McKay. Which is it?

506
00:28:04,605 --> 00:28:08,837
If we end this conversation right now,
I can still manage the former.

507
00:28:08,909 --> 00:28:11,844
- Sheppard's right.
- About what?

508
00:28:18,051 --> 00:28:21,043
Perhaps now would be a good time
to undertake our secondary objective.

509
00:28:21,822 --> 00:28:24,619
By all means.
I'll show you to my office.

510
00:29:03,629 --> 00:29:06,621
How can you possibly control
the power flow from so small a device?

511
00:29:06,699 --> 00:29:08,599
Because, technically speaking,
as far as you're concerned,

512
00:29:08,868 --> 00:29:10,426
I'm from the future.

513
00:29:10,803 --> 00:29:12,464
Dr. McKay appreciates your help.

514
00:29:16,341 --> 00:29:18,639
- What is it with genius and social skills?
- Hmm?

515
00:29:19,544 --> 00:29:21,842
Never mind. We're good to go
as far as the Stargate is concerned.

516
00:29:21,913 --> 00:29:25,110
Good, good. Just loading the program,
so 10 minutes, tops.

517
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,017
I'll just come right out and ask.

518
00:29:27,085 --> 00:29:29,053
Once we've proven we can do this,

519
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,645
<i>would you be interested
in joining Destiny's crew?</i>

520
00:29:32,223 --> 00:29:33,281
Well, I never actually...

521
00:29:33,358 --> 00:29:35,258
I know that you can pretty much
write your own ticket

522
00:29:35,327 --> 00:29:36,726
as far as assignments are concerned,

523
00:29:37,028 --> 00:29:38,723
but there isn't a more exciting mission
out there.

524
00:29:39,064 --> 00:29:41,589
Well, there is the niggling issue
of not being able to get home.

525
00:29:41,666 --> 00:29:44,726
Not yet,
but we get the right people aboard,

526
00:29:44,803 --> 00:29:46,395
<i>return Destiny
to its former glory...</i>

527
00:29:46,471 --> 00:29:47,460
If that's even possible.

528
00:29:47,572 --> 00:29:48,800
That why I need you.

529
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:52,900
I thought Colonel Young was in command.

530
00:29:55,313 --> 00:29:58,009
Let me rephrase. That's why we need you.

531
00:30:08,826 --> 00:30:10,054
Mandy!

532
00:30:10,628 --> 00:30:11,993
I just wanted to make sure
you got back all right.

533
00:30:12,963 --> 00:30:14,658
- Home again.
- I'm glad.

534
00:30:15,265 --> 00:30:17,130
- I was worried.
- I know you were.

535
00:30:17,201 --> 00:30:20,500
The last thing I would ever want is...

536
00:30:27,478 --> 00:30:29,002
What the hell was that?

537
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:30,842
An emergency shutdown
of the FTL drive.

538
00:30:32,616 --> 00:30:34,709
- Ginn!
- I don't think there will be any damage,

539
00:30:34,785 --> 00:30:35,911
but I needed the distraction.

540
00:30:36,954 --> 00:30:38,819
Dr. Rush is in danger.

541
00:30:38,889 --> 00:30:40,356
I know, we've been trying to get him out,

542
00:30:40,424 --> 00:30:42,119
and I've been looking for you.

543
00:30:44,662 --> 00:30:45,651
It was a mistake.

544
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:49,395
She didn't do it intentionally,
but there's no way out of the simulation.

545
00:30:49,733 --> 00:30:50,722
Who are we talking about?

546
00:30:51,335 --> 00:30:52,562
Dr. Perry.

547
00:30:52,635 --> 00:30:56,036
I tried to reach out to you sooner,
but she keeps stopping me,

548
00:30:56,105 --> 00:30:58,164
or suppressing me.

549
00:30:58,241 --> 00:31:01,699
It's hard to explain. It's taking all
of my concentration just to be here.

550
00:31:02,211 --> 00:31:03,303
Why would she do that?

551
00:31:03,379 --> 00:31:05,244
She's trying to buy time
to solve the problem

552
00:31:05,314 --> 00:31:08,545
in her initial programming
of the simulation, but she can't.

553
00:31:08,885 --> 00:31:11,046
The only way to end this
is from the outside.

554
00:31:13,356 --> 00:31:14,789
You have to do it, Eli.

555
00:31:16,492 --> 00:31:19,518
- How?
- You have to...

556
00:31:20,163 --> 00:31:24,065
Ginn! Ginn...

557
00:31:32,075 --> 00:31:33,440
Hey, what happened?

558
00:31:33,509 --> 00:31:37,377
I sensed a potential overload
in one of the FTL drive modules.

559
00:31:37,447 --> 00:31:39,711
I was able to stop it
with an emergency shutdown.

560
00:31:39,782 --> 00:31:40,771
Very good.

561
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:47,753
So, should I leave you to your work
or can we sit and talk a while?

562
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:50,257
Well, I should work, really.

563
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,390
- I'll see you soon.
- Sure.

564
00:32:12,881 --> 00:32:13,870
We have a problem.

565
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:17,516
- You couldn't find proof?
- Oh, I found proof, all right.

566
00:32:17,586 --> 00:32:18,848
That for the past several months,

567
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,888
the Langarans have steadfastly refused

568
00:32:20,956 --> 00:32:22,821
to have anything
to do with the Lucian Alliance.

569
00:32:23,325 --> 00:32:25,054
It doesn't take that long to say "no."

570
00:32:25,127 --> 00:32:27,595
In each exchange they've been
offered more, much more,

571
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:31,059
and each time they refused,
apparently out of concern

572
00:32:31,132 --> 00:32:34,158
for jeopardizing their alliance with us.
I told you...

573
00:32:34,235 --> 00:32:36,066
Woolsey, we had damn good reason
to suspect...

574
00:32:36,137 --> 00:32:38,503
Yes, because of our spy satellites.

575
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,505
This changes nothing.

576
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:54,781
I believe it's for you, Administrator.

577
00:32:58,626 --> 00:33:01,459
This is Administrator Halpurn.

578
00:33:01,529 --> 00:33:04,987
Sir, I don't know who you've spoken to,
but there is nothing to be concerned about.

579
00:33:05,065 --> 00:33:06,362
Everything...

580
00:33:07,034 --> 00:33:08,661
Ambassador?

581
00:33:11,438 --> 00:33:12,427
They're on their way.

582
00:33:25,251 --> 00:33:28,687
Shouldn't you be trying to get me
out of the neural interface chair?

583
00:33:28,755 --> 00:33:31,781
I might, if you were still
in the neural interface chair,

584
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:33,186
but seeing as how...

585
00:33:35,228 --> 00:33:36,889
- What are you doing?
- Nothing to be concerned about.

586
00:33:36,963 --> 00:33:38,863
You're dialing the shield strength back
all over the ship.

587
00:33:39,098 --> 00:33:40,326
Yeah, not to worry.

588
00:33:40,466 --> 00:33:42,297
No, you... Stop! Stop!

589
00:33:42,368 --> 00:33:46,236
Listen! If the shield strength drops
below 4%, the ship will rip itself apart!

590
00:33:46,306 --> 00:33:47,330
You'll be fine.

591
00:33:47,407 --> 00:33:48,499
No! No, I won't!

592
00:33:54,514 --> 00:33:56,448
Why are you doing this?

593
00:33:56,516 --> 00:33:59,178
Because I haven't left the simulation yet,
have I?

594
00:33:59,252 --> 00:34:00,913
It's time for me to find a way out myself.

595
00:34:00,987 --> 00:34:01,976
This isn't the way...

596
00:34:02,055 --> 00:34:04,455
Look, all simulations require parameters,

597
00:34:04,524 --> 00:34:07,254
conditions beyond which the programmed
scenario can no longer continue.

598
00:34:07,594 --> 00:34:10,255
If this doesn't stop it,
I don't know what will.

599
00:34:10,462 --> 00:34:12,555
No, Nick, this is really happening.

600
00:34:12,631 --> 00:34:14,155
You're going to kill everyone on this ship.

601
00:34:16,268 --> 00:34:17,758
I don't think so.

602
00:34:45,731 --> 00:34:48,757
David, we need to reconsider
what we're doing.

603
00:34:49,034 --> 00:34:50,695
"Better to beg forgiveness
than ask for permission."

604
00:34:50,769 --> 00:34:51,758
That's what my dad used to always say.

605
00:34:51,837 --> 00:34:54,806
That only made sense when we could
achieve the dial-out before we got caught.

606
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,329
We still can.

607
00:34:57,809 --> 00:34:59,901
McKay, what are you waiting for?

608
00:34:59,977 --> 00:35:02,810
The program is running.

609
00:35:07,618 --> 00:35:10,212
Listen to me, Everett, I need
to get back there, and you need supplies.

610
00:35:10,288 --> 00:35:12,552
Sir, there's a sizable force
gathering outside the building.

611
00:35:12,857 --> 00:35:13,983
Chevron one is encoded.

612
00:35:15,993 --> 00:35:19,019
If I could have your attention, please!

613
00:35:19,096 --> 00:35:20,290
For safety reasons,

614
00:35:20,364 --> 00:35:25,324
I need all Langaran personnel
to leave this room immediately. Thank you.

615
00:35:25,603 --> 00:35:27,127
There's no time.

616
00:35:27,204 --> 00:35:28,796
We should stop now and dial Earth.

617
00:35:28,973 --> 00:35:30,702
No! We can't quit now,
not when we're this close.

618
00:35:30,775 --> 00:35:32,902
This will be a diplomatic disaster.

619
00:35:33,311 --> 00:35:36,838
I give a damn about those people
on that ship, I make no apologies for that.

620
00:35:36,914 --> 00:35:39,246
If we stop now,
we give up any chance of helping them!

621
00:35:39,317 --> 00:35:41,376
And if we don't stop,
people will get hurt, David.

622
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:43,951
We've got two trained SG units,
plus you and me.

623
00:35:44,021 --> 00:35:46,182
All we need to do is hold them off
until we can make a connection.

624
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,154
Chevron two encoded!

625
00:35:51,561 --> 00:35:53,256
- Then what?
We stand down.

626
00:35:53,563 --> 00:35:55,030
We explain what happened,
the whole thing,

627
00:35:55,098 --> 00:35:57,225
but at least we will have proven to them
that it works.

628
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,927
Chevron three encoded!

629
00:36:00,637 --> 00:36:01,626
Sir?

630
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,729
Do not fire!

631
00:36:04,808 --> 00:36:08,744
I repeat, do not fire unless fired upon!

632
00:36:09,245 --> 00:36:11,577
Everett, I do not want to hurt anyone
any more than you do,

633
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,876
but we've only got one shot at this.

634
00:36:12,949 --> 00:36:15,008
- You want to get back that bad?
Not just for my sake.

635
00:36:15,385 --> 00:36:17,012
<i>This place can be
Destiny's lifeline.</i>

636
00:36:17,187 --> 00:36:19,314
Chevron four encoded.

637
00:36:19,389 --> 00:36:22,517
We know what you're attempting to do,
and it will not be tolerated!

638
00:36:22,592 --> 00:36:24,082
Ambassador, the Earth's delegation

639
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,890
has convinced me that there is no danger.

640
00:36:26,963 --> 00:36:28,794
I don't know who you are,

641
00:36:28,865 --> 00:36:31,299
but Administrator Halpurn
would never agree to this.

642
00:36:32,068 --> 00:36:33,558
Chevron five encoded!

643
00:36:33,636 --> 00:36:35,228
Our forces have been instructed
to open fire

644
00:36:35,305 --> 00:36:38,034
if the dialing process
reaches the eighth chevron.

645
00:36:38,107 --> 00:36:40,507
We just want to prove to you
that it can be done, that's all!

646
00:36:40,676 --> 00:36:42,075
The choice is yours.

647
00:36:48,751 --> 00:36:50,616
- Power levels?
- Well within my predictions.

648
00:36:50,853 --> 00:36:51,911
- So it would have worked?
- Absolutely.

649
00:36:52,821 --> 00:36:55,915
Chevron six is locked, by the way,
and I would not be standing there.

650
00:36:55,991 --> 00:36:57,219
They won't shoot.

651
00:36:58,227 --> 00:37:01,196
Colonel, look, I may just be
the brilliant scientist

652
00:37:01,263 --> 00:37:03,458
relegated to shouting out the obvious
in terms of chevrons here,

653
00:37:03,532 --> 00:37:08,560
but while I'm stating the obvious,
this mission is already a failure.

654
00:37:08,637 --> 00:37:09,626
It's only going to get worse.

655
00:37:16,578 --> 00:37:17,567
Thank you.

656
00:37:22,317 --> 00:37:23,306
Shut it down.

657
00:37:37,532 --> 00:37:38,931
There's no way
to shut down the simulation.

658
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,228
Why not?
- Because Perry's the one

659
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:41,290
who programmed the parameters.

660
00:37:41,369 --> 00:37:43,564
Unconsciously or not,
she's keeping him there.

661
00:37:43,638 --> 00:37:45,196
- So what are we doing?
- Ginn told me

662
00:37:45,273 --> 00:37:46,831
the only way to do it's from the outside.

663
00:37:47,909 --> 00:37:50,503
Dr. Perry pulled her away from me
before she got the words out,

664
00:37:50,578 --> 00:37:53,775
but I'm pretty sure I know
what she was gonna say.

665
00:38:01,055 --> 00:38:02,215
Why did you do that, Nick?

666
00:38:03,891 --> 00:38:05,256
To prove that it wasn't real.

667
00:38:07,628 --> 00:38:08,617
Why did you lie to me?

668
00:38:09,197 --> 00:38:10,425
I thought it was some kind of glitch.

669
00:38:10,498 --> 00:38:13,058
I thought it was something
that I could repair.

670
00:38:13,367 --> 00:38:16,494
They could just keep your body alive
while I found a way.

671
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:18,094
You wouldn't have to worry.

672
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:19,931
So what do we do?

673
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,906
It's out of my hands now.
Ginn finally got through to Eli.

674
00:38:25,445 --> 00:38:27,242
It was never her fault, was it?

675
00:38:28,949 --> 00:38:29,938
No.

676
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:35,284
It was an innocent mistake in programming
the parameters of the simulation.

677
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:37,755
It was so simple
that nothing could go wrong.

678
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,291
What were the parameters?

679
00:38:39,626 --> 00:38:40,615
I don't blame you.

680
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,784
For what?

681
00:38:44,131 --> 00:38:46,725
Amanda, what were they?

682
00:38:47,501 --> 00:38:49,264
That we love each other.

683
00:38:51,705 --> 00:38:52,933
That's all.

684
00:38:54,608 --> 00:38:56,769
That was the only thing
that needed to happen,

685
00:38:56,843 --> 00:38:59,937
and then you could have come and gone
as you wished.

686
00:39:00,614 --> 00:39:02,241
I love you, Nick.

687
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,444
- But you don't...
- No!

688
00:39:04,518 --> 00:39:06,985
No, no, of course I do.

689
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,778
That can't be the problem.

690
00:39:08,854 --> 00:39:10,446
It's not something you can will to be true.

691
00:39:10,956 --> 00:39:12,184
But it is true.

692
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:15,382
I love you.

693
00:39:16,428 --> 00:39:18,089
This wasn't fair to you to begin with.

694
00:39:18,164 --> 00:39:20,792
I've felt this way about you
for most of my life.

695
00:39:20,866 --> 00:39:24,461
No, no. Amanda, please listen to me,
here, now.

696
00:39:24,537 --> 00:39:27,301
I mean, not the verdict
of some bloody program.

697
00:39:27,673 --> 00:39:28,970
You don't have much time.

698
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:30,269
Eli has

699
00:39:30,342 --> 00:39:33,072
already started deleting the memory
where our consciousness is stored.

700
00:39:33,812 --> 00:39:34,904
You and Ginn?

701
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:36,570
It's the strangest feeling...

702
00:39:36,649 --> 00:39:38,344
- Well, stop him!
- I can't.

703
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:39,748
No, try! Protect yourself!

704
00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:45,321
I know you blame yourself for my death,
but don't. Okay?

705
00:39:47,626 --> 00:39:50,652
Because if that hadn't happened,
then I never would have felt this.

706
00:39:52,798 --> 00:39:56,392
I do love you. I swear it.

707
00:40:00,171 --> 00:40:01,365
Goodbye.

708
00:40:17,956 --> 00:40:18,980
Is that you?

709
00:40:21,593 --> 00:40:23,220
- Yeah, it's us.
Yeah.

710
00:40:24,229 --> 00:40:25,218
How'd the mission go?

711
00:40:25,296 --> 00:40:26,820
They've agreed to release our people

712
00:40:26,898 --> 00:40:30,356
in exchange for the defense of their planet
from the Lucian Alliance,

713
00:40:30,435 --> 00:40:33,336
also the removal of the Stargate
from their power facility.

714
00:40:33,404 --> 00:40:35,838
So, mission not accomplished.

715
00:40:37,141 --> 00:40:38,802
- Speaking of letting prisoners free...
Oh.

716
00:40:40,345 --> 00:40:41,835
They seemed decent enough.

717
00:40:41,913 --> 00:40:44,574
I didn't think there'd be harm
in showing them the ship and crew

718
00:40:44,648 --> 00:40:46,115
that they were trying to help.

719
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,242
I hope that was all right.

720
00:40:48,585 --> 00:40:50,109
Lieutenant, in the grand scheme of things,

721
00:40:50,187 --> 00:40:54,123
I think that was the best decision
any of us has made all day.

722
00:41:01,498 --> 00:41:04,296
What happened? How did I get here?

723
00:41:05,535 --> 00:41:07,127
You've actually been back
for a couple of days.

724
00:41:07,204 --> 00:41:10,469
It just took you that long
to come out of the coma.

725
00:41:13,277 --> 00:41:15,507
Eli, what the hell did you do?

726
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,180
What the hell did I do?

727
00:41:19,416 --> 00:41:23,443
I transferred the memory
where they were stored into quarantine.

728
00:41:23,754 --> 00:41:26,780
They're cut off
from the rest of the ship now, and us.

729
00:41:28,058 --> 00:41:29,548
- They?
- There was no other way.

730
00:41:29,626 --> 00:41:32,720
That's what Ginn said,
so that's what I did.

731
00:41:35,097 --> 00:41:36,325
To save you.

732
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:41,998
No, Eli!

733
00:41:42,471 --> 00:41:43,904
Forget it.

734
00:41:46,742 --> 00:41:48,403
You need to rest.

735
00:41:50,546 --> 00:41:52,980
In fact, you're lucky to be alive.

736
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,479
Listen to her, Doc.

737
00:41:57,787 --> 00:41:59,618
She knows what she's talking about.

738
00:43:28,308 --> 00:43:29,297
