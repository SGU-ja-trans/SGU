none of this was my fault.

This ship could be the most important
discovery mankind has made

34
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:41,890
since the stargate itself.

35
00:02:43,064 --> 00:02:47,763
You know, the lcarus Project was
something your father truly believed in.

What difference does it make if we all die?

A number of people died
during the attack on the base.

l'm sure some had more value than others.

l'd like to know a little more about him.

61
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:31,461
No matter how tired he was,
or how long he'd worked,

62
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:38,871
or what was going on in his life,
he always had time to listen to me.

63
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:43,369
l'd go on and on.

64
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:46,745
He never preached.

65
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:53,451
He never told me what to do,
even though sometimes l wished he would.

66
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:58,154
He would just listen.

67
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:03,088
And then he would tell me
that he loved me.

68
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:11,301
The best part was if l'd had a fight
with my mom, he never took sides.

69
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:12,931
Hmm.

70
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:17,571
Oh, God. My mom.

Don't you even care?

83
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:43,258
Of course l do, and l'm also trying to learn
as much as l can, as quickly as l can.

nine separate searches

of solving our life-support issues.

Translated from Ancient.

91
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:22,463
l've also discovered
that they were never here.

92

l thought this was an Ancient ship.

93
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,777
lt is, but they sent it out unmanned,

94
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:33,038
planning to use the gate to get here

95
00:08:33,147 --> 00:08:35,911
when it was far enough
out into the universe,

96
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:39,577
but they probably learned to Ascend
before that time.

97
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,085
Learned to what?

98
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:44,385
Ascension.

99
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:49,885
lt's a process whereby
consciousness converts to energy

100
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:52,830
that no longer requires physical form.

lt wasn't even that hard to find.
lt's right here in the dialing program.

00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:29,300
-You're sure?
-Yes, it's an eight-symbol address.

108
00:09:46,598 --> 00:09:48,657
You mean you can dial this thing
back to Earth?

109
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,960
There's no point of origin indicated,

110
00:09:50,102 --> 00:09:52,127
but still,
there's only 36 symbols on this gate.

111

117
00:10:05,017 --> 00:10:06,541

Where did that come from?

120
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,990
l just want to know who to blame for this.

121
00:10:15,394 --> 00:10:20,263
They're a human coalition
made up from various Milky Way planets,

122
00:09:40,225 --> 00:09:43,217
lt wasn't even that hard to find.
lt's right here in the dialing program.

00:09:43,328 --> 00:09:46,263

-Yes, it's an eight-symbol address.

when the Goa'uld were defeated.

A street gang with starships.

How'd they find out about lcarus?

127
00:10:30,575 --> 00:10:32,805
Wasn't it supposed to be, like,
double secret?

128
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:36,642
l suspect there was a leak somewhere.
Someone working on the inside.

129
00:09:46,365 --> 00:09:48,424
You mean you can dial this thing
back to Earth?

130

There's no point of origin indicated,

131

but still,
there's only 36 symbols on this gate.

132

The legend surrounding the ninth chevron

133
00:10:40,085 --> 00:10:42,713
has been floating around our galaxy
for some time now.

134
00:10:43,522 --> 00:10:47,515
We found that it meant various things
to different cultures.

135
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:50,992
Some said
it was a key to the universe itself.

136
00:10:51,229 --> 00:10:54,528
And once unlocked,
you would gain untold power.

137
00:09:52,004 --> 00:09:55,098
l'm assuming the ninth symbol represents
some X-factor distance equation.

138

Well, l don't care. Start dialing.

139
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,364
Now, if the Lucian Alliance
knew that we'd discovered

140
00:10:57,502 --> 00:11:01,370
the address and a means to dial,
they'd want it.

141

146
00:11:16,388 --> 00:11:18,549
Why you risked everything to get here.

00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:23,525

to send all these people home safely

and then return
with a properly skilled team

-Colonel Young. You're up.
-Nice to see you, too, Rush.

162

the address for home.

167

is marginal at best.

168
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:45,480
RlLEY: With respect, Doctor, l know enough
to recognize a reference to Earth.

169
00:10:45,615 --> 00:10:48,049
He says the address wasn't
that hard to find, Rush.

170
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:50,278
No, no. This is a complete
waste of power we may need.

All we need is the right point of origin.

to operate the main systems.

-Well, l've only just learned myself,

-Even if it doesn't work,

need to see us at least try.

00:11:11,308 --> 00:11:13,105
So, what, you're going to drain
what little power we have

180
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,404

181
00:11:14,511 --> 00:11:15,739

Colonel, it looks like
we've dropped out of FTL.

187
00:11:39,503 --> 00:11:42,529
-RlLEY: Because we were draining power?
-No, no.

188

lf l'm right, the gate should
begin to dial any moment.

How did you know that?

190
00:11:57,354 --> 00:12:02,553
The ship detected a stargate on a planet
within range that may have what we need.

191
00:12:02,692 --> 00:12:06,389
What? How the hell
are there even stargates out here?

192
00:12:07,531 --> 00:12:11,797
The Ancients sent out a number
of unmanned ships ahead of this one.

193
00:12:12,068 --> 00:12:15,367
They're programed
to gather data, resources,

194
00:12:15,505 --> 00:12:19,032
to manufacture stargates
and deposit them in habitable worlds.

195

is relayed back here to help plot the course.

You're telling me
that this ship knows we're in trouble?

197

Yes, because l told it we were.

198
00:12:28,418 --> 00:12:31,581
Essentially, we're flying on autopilot.

199
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:34,087
This ship may have stopped
when it was within range of a stargate

200

regardless of our need.

201
00:12:36,293 --> 00:12:37,521

on the other side of that wormhole?

203

An educated guess, yes.

204

RlLEY: Sir, you can't do that.
We have no idea what's on the other side.

We can use the Kino to find out.

-What have we got?

BROD Y: Looks like four other addresses
came up here, too.

214
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:28,534
They could be other planets within range.

215
00:13:28,645 --> 00:13:30,306
Maybe we should think about
dialing them up and seeing...

216

No, no, no, they're locked out.

217

The ship chose this one.

218
00:13:34,084 --> 00:13:36,951
The stargate is open,
all we have to do is step through.

219

anything we've seen before.

Yeah, the water may be gone now,

291
00:18:42,881 --> 00:18:46,715
but this desert was formed by
H2O evaporating on a playa floor,

292
00:18:46,819 --> 00:18:50,220
causing gypsum to be deposited
in a fine crystalline form called selenite.

PALMER: lf this sand is high enough
in calcite concentration,

296
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:07,230
the solution would absorb the acid.

297

342
00:21:44,714 --> 00:21:46,147
We're still alive because of what he did.

343
00:21:46,249 --> 00:21:49,377
-Look, for what it's worth...
-Well, it's worth a lot.

344
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:51,885
You know, as long as we're still here,
l promise you...

345
00:21:52,022 --> 00:21:55,458
Colonel, l've edited enough
of my father's speeches

346
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:56,617
to know what you're going to say.

347
00:20:57,501 --> 00:20:59,731
-They allow us to...
-Yeah, l know what they are.

348
00:20:59,836 --> 00:21:03,932
Good. Well, l'm about to use one of them
to report to my superiors on Earth,

349
00:21:56,726 --> 00:21:59,786
You don't have a clue
what l was going to say, because l don't.

350
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,894
We...

351
00:22:06,036 --> 00:22:09,995
We brought along an Ancient device.
Communication stones.

352
00:22:10,106 --> 00:22:12,336
-They allow us to...
-Yeah, l know what they are.

353
00:22:12,442 --> 00:22:16,538
Good. Well, l'm about to use one of them
to report to my superiors on Earth,

354
00:21:04,074 --> 00:21:06,065
tell them our situation.

355
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,671
tell them our situation.

356
00:22:23,887 --> 00:22:25,684
l want to tell her myself.

357
00:21:11,281 --> 00:21:13,078
l want to tell her myself.

358
00:21:26,648 --> 00:21:29,173
You've been sitting here
since Rush made contact.

359
00:21:29,284 --> 00:21:30,683
Let somebody else take a shift.

360
00:21:31,219 --> 00:21:32,243
(EXHALES )

361
00:21:32,387 --> 00:21:33,911
l'm not leaving this chair.

362
00:21:34,623 --> 00:21:36,056
l've been on this project
for the last six months,

363
00:21:36,157 --> 00:21:37,852
and l'll be damned if...

364
00:21:40,629 --> 00:21:41,891
Colonel?

365
00:21:49,971 --> 00:21:51,700
This is strange.

366
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,275
MEHTA: Dr. Rush, is that you?

367
00:21:58,179 --> 00:21:59,373
No, it's Colonel Young.

368
00:21:59,481 --> 00:22:02,143
l need you to put me in a room
with General O'Neill.

369
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,814
l'm going to need you, too.

370
00:22:10,258 --> 00:22:11,987
JOHANSEN: Sir, l told you not to get up.

371
00:22:12,127 --> 00:22:13,389
(BREATHlNG HEAVlLY)

372
00:22:14,996 --> 00:22:16,088
TELFORD: What did he do to himself?

373
00:22:16,197 --> 00:22:18,427
He's got cracked ribs,
more bruises than l can count

374
00:22:18,533 --> 00:22:21,127
and a concussion
that resulted in neuropraxia.

375
00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:23,829
-Oh, that's just great.
-Chloe?

376
00:22:23,972 --> 00:22:26,406
-Dr. Mehta.
-Can you help me, please?

377

(GROANlNG)

378
00:22:31,646 --> 00:22:35,514
You know, l had some of my
favorite arguments with your father.

379
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:38,084
Are you saying you won some?

380
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,817
Depends on who you ask.

381
00:22:44,993 --> 00:22:48,156
Listen, Major Green'll be escorting you
to see your mother.

382
00:22:49,331 --> 00:22:53,631
-Please give her my condolences.
-Thank you.

383
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,500
Yeah.

384
00:23:02,143 --> 00:23:04,941
So, how is it going out there really?

385
00:23:05,046 --> 00:23:08,607
l don't know what Rush has told you.
We may not have much time left.

386
00:23:08,717 --> 00:23:10,651
The ship's very old. lt's falling apart.

387
00:23:11,353 --> 00:23:12,877
-Fix it.
-We're trying.

388
00:23:13,021 --> 00:23:15,922
Even if we can get the life support working,
we don't have much food and water.

389
00:23:16,024 --> 00:23:18,686
-Then go get some.
-We're not supposed to be there, sir.

390
00:23:18,827 --> 00:23:20,886
These are the wrong people
in the wrong place,

391
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:23,293
and as a group, they're just not qualified.

392
00:23:23,398 --> 00:23:24,524
Oh, please.

393
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:27,157
l wasn't qualified to lead that first team
through the stargate...

394
00:23:27,302 --> 00:23:30,271
-l understand that, sir.
-ln the past dozen years or so,

395
00:23:30,372 --> 00:23:33,671
we've sent hundreds of teams
through that thing...

396
00:23:35,577 --> 00:23:36,635
(SlGHS )

397
00:23:36,745 --> 00:23:38,838
And l think the bottom line is,

398
00:23:40,148 --> 00:23:41,843
none of us are qualified.

399
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,377
l just think we're going to get
to a point very soon

400
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:47,454
where everyone onboard
should get a chance to say goodbye.

401
00:23:49,858 --> 00:23:50,847
Understood.

402
00:24:07,042 --> 00:24:08,066
Save it.

403
00:24:09,878 --> 00:24:11,505
FRANKLlN: That's not very smart.

404
00:24:11,613 --> 00:24:13,706
Temperatures like these,
the human body needs at least...

405
00:24:13,848 --> 00:24:16,180
GREER: Walk, don't talk.
