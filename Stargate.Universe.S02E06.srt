1
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:05,446
<i>This is what Destiny intended from
the moment it entered the star system.</i>

2
00:00:05,515 --> 00:00:08,483
<i>That ship is the best chance
we have of getting home.</i>

3
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:11,419
- Are we done?
- We'll never be done.

4
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:14,118
<i>You shouldn't have
left him on the planet.</i>

5
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:15,782
<i>You think I don't know that?</i>

6
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:19,386
<i>Everyone thinks we're safe.
They think that they'll never find us again.</i>

7
00:00:19,462 --> 00:00:21,431
Why did you take
one of our people prisoner?

8
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:24,430
<i>We're not safe, are we?</i>

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,492
They're coming!
- Who's coming?

10
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,197
<i>Lucian Alliance,
they're coming to take Destiny.</i>

11
00:00:28,272 --> 00:00:30,102
<i>There's only one way
this is going to end if we wait.</i>

12
00:00:30,174 --> 00:00:31,835
<i>I'm not
surrendering this ship.</i>

13
00:00:32,743 --> 00:00:35,109
I'm pregnant. It's yours.

14
00:00:35,714 --> 00:00:38,045
<i>Emily!
I'm barely keeping it together,</i>

15
00:00:38,115 --> 00:00:40,676
and the only thing that's keeping me
from going out of my mind is you.

16
00:00:40,752 --> 00:00:42,686
You made your choice, Everett.

17
00:00:42,754 --> 00:00:44,585
You really should talk to someone.

18
00:00:44,656 --> 00:00:48,752
<i>Look, I lost my baby.
And now maybe she's in a better place.</i>

19
00:00:48,827 --> 00:00:52,264
<i>You found the keys to controlling
all ofDestiny's systems.</i>

20
00:00:52,331 --> 00:00:53,763
And you're not going
to tell anyone?

21
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:55,895
Riley is not going to make it, sir.

22
00:00:57,904 --> 00:00:59,337
Look, I'm already healing.

23
00:00:59,672 --> 00:01:02,197
<i>A transfusion of Chloe's blood
could help save his life.</i>

24
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:05,208
<i>And pass whatever the
aliens did to her on to him.</i>

25
00:01:29,404 --> 00:01:31,635
We've run a series
of comparative blood tests

26
00:01:31,707 --> 00:01:35,073
using various pathogens we've encountered
and isolated along the way.

27
00:01:35,143 --> 00:01:39,308
While Chloe's blood continues
to show atypical antibiotic properties,

28
00:01:40,382 --> 00:01:43,044
Lieutenant Scott's seems
to have gone back to normal.

29
00:01:44,753 --> 00:01:45,845
Sir.

30
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:51,184
I'm just saying I think it's safe
to let him out of isolation.

31
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,895
That's fine. I'll have him released.

32
00:01:56,066 --> 00:01:58,534
- You okay?
- Emily wants a divorce.

33
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,304
I just got back, and I don't know.

34
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:05,068
I guess I should have seen it coming,

35
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:10,079
but is it even legal to sign papers
in someone else's body?

36
00:02:10,748 --> 00:02:12,648
I wouldn't know.

37
00:02:13,017 --> 00:02:14,848
Well, I guess it doesn't matter.

38
00:02:16,821 --> 00:02:18,050
Thanks.

39
00:02:20,092 --> 00:02:21,581
Wait, uh...

40
00:02:22,995 --> 00:02:25,361
Maybe we should talk.
After everything that's happened,

41
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,888
we haven't had the chance.

42
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:31,467
Is there anything
that you and I could possibly say

43
00:02:31,536 --> 00:02:32,833
that's going to make it any better?

44
00:02:33,673 --> 00:02:35,140
Maybe that's not the point.

45
00:02:35,475 --> 00:02:37,237
Well, then, what is?

46
00:03:00,834 --> 00:03:03,132
Eli.
- Hey.

47
00:03:04,372 --> 00:03:08,968
I don't know if you've met Ginn,
one of our guests from the Lucian Alliance.

48
00:03:09,077 --> 00:03:13,343
She's been cooperating, providing intel
on Alliance activity in the Milky Way,

49
00:03:13,415 --> 00:03:17,010
but I think she may be able
to help us on the ship as well.

50
00:03:17,085 --> 00:03:20,613
I spent over a year studying
Ancient systems to prepare for the trip.

51
00:03:20,689 --> 00:03:23,180
I was particularly interested
in some of your theories

52
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:24,988
on dialing while inside a star.

53
00:03:26,695 --> 00:03:27,923
Wow.

54
00:03:28,064 --> 00:03:30,056
Do you still think there's a chance
you could make it work?

55
00:03:31,368 --> 00:03:33,961
To be honest,
I wasn't really making much progress,

56
00:03:34,036 --> 00:03:35,766
so I kind of put it aside.

57
00:03:36,306 --> 00:03:39,298
Well, maybe with Ginn's help,
that can change.

58
00:03:41,278 --> 00:03:42,540
I guess it's worth a shot.

59
00:03:43,413 --> 00:03:45,848
Good. I'll leave you to it.

60
00:03:51,055 --> 00:03:52,113
Have a seat.

61
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,782
Thanks.

62
00:03:57,795 --> 00:03:59,923
- They let you out.
- Yeah.

63
00:04:00,966 --> 00:04:03,934
So you're not changing.

64
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:06,630
Well, T.J. says I'm pretty much
back to normal.

65
00:04:06,738 --> 00:04:11,471
I guess everyone was a little afraid
I'd poisoned you with my alien blood.

66
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,706
You're not contagious.
They're just keeping you here because...

67
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:20,252
Because I might black out and sabotage
the ship without even knowing it.

68
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:21,911
You saved my life.

69
00:04:22,489 --> 00:04:25,117
If you were just some alien monster,
you would've left me to die out there

70
00:04:25,191 --> 00:04:26,784
and no one would have known any better.

71
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,991
My skin's changing.

72
00:04:30,965 --> 00:04:32,057
Look.

73
00:04:34,767 --> 00:04:39,000
It's coarse. Like, it's getting hard.

74
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,636
And it's growing.

75
00:04:45,312 --> 00:04:46,575
It doesn't matter.

76
00:04:48,283 --> 00:04:49,875
Listen. Hey.

77
00:04:51,987 --> 00:04:55,150
We're going to find a way out of this,
I promise.

78
00:05:12,976 --> 00:05:14,636
<i>Colonel
Young, come in.</i>

79
00:05:19,016 --> 00:05:20,984
<i>Colonel Young, this is Brody
in the Control Interface Room.</i>

80
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:22,609
<i>Please respond.</i>

81
00:05:27,258 --> 00:05:28,885
This is Young. Go ahead.

82
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,824
<i>We've got a bit of a situation here.</i>

83
00:05:32,497 --> 00:05:33,987
I'm on my way.

84
00:05:36,434 --> 00:05:37,902
- What do we got?
- Nine alien ships.

85
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,699
They just dropped out of hyperspace.
They've got us surrounded.

86
00:05:40,772 --> 00:05:42,468
Looks like the same ones
who took Rush and Chloe.

87
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:45,669
We left them behind in another galaxy.
How the hell did they find us out here?

88
00:05:45,744 --> 00:05:48,144
We're getting a message.

89
00:05:49,648 --> 00:05:51,013
Oh, my God.

90
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:53,615
They want us to hand over Chloe.

91
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:56,183
What if all this time they were slowly
changing her to one of them,

92
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,087
- and now they want her back?
- She's not one of them.

93
00:05:58,158 --> 00:05:59,648
She was gathering intelligence.

94
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,989
She may not have known it
but that's what she was doing.

95
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,962
All the more reason not
to let them anywhere near her.

96
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,089
- How long till we jump?
- Forty-four minutes.

97
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,857
Power weapons.

98
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:24,481
I don't think that's the response
they were looking for.

99
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,052
Return fire.

100
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:35,056
Watch your heads.
All right, let's move! This is not a drill!

101
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,121
Sergeant, you get these people
to designated areas.

102
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,599
I'm gonna go and check observation.

103
00:06:38,668 --> 00:06:41,068
All right. Come on, come on, come on.
Let's go, let's go. Come on!

104
00:06:44,207 --> 00:06:45,196
What are you doing?

105
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:47,033
We're under attack.

106
00:06:48,712 --> 00:06:50,872
I can see that.

107
00:06:51,214 --> 00:06:52,647
You can't take on this many ships.

108
00:06:52,715 --> 00:06:54,946
<i>They want Destiny more than anything.
They wouldn't destroy us.</i>

109
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:57,486
Well, not intentionally,
but they'd have to collapse the shields

110
00:06:57,553 --> 00:06:59,784
in order to board us,
and that's a risky proposition.

111
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:42,163
Colonel, this is Scott.
You need to seal the entire section

112
00:07:42,235 --> 00:07:43,600
around the observation deck.

113
00:07:44,204 --> 00:07:46,468
- Why?
- Seal it now! Now!

114
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,546
<i>Scott! What's going on?</i>

115
00:08:01,222 --> 00:08:03,452
We've got secondary explosions
in the engineering area.

116
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,715
Scott, come in!

117
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:07,318
Power's overloading in the sublight drive.
It's going critical.

118
00:08:07,396 --> 00:08:08,885
Emergency shutdown!

119
00:08:14,737 --> 00:08:15,762
It's too late.

120
00:08:45,469 --> 00:08:47,699
The plan is to get the repair robot working

121
00:08:47,772 --> 00:08:51,037
on the large domed room we found
when we first came aboard the ship.

122
00:08:51,108 --> 00:08:53,077
If the structural integrity
can be restored,

123
00:08:53,145 --> 00:08:55,511
it can be used as a new home
for hydroponics.

124
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,808
Do we know how long it would be

125
00:08:56,882 --> 00:08:58,941
before the room can hold
atmospheric pressure?

126
00:08:59,084 --> 00:09:00,847
Well, we've crunched some numbers,
and we think...

127
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,444
What about the weapons systems?

128
00:09:02,655 --> 00:09:04,451
Still half a dozen gun batteries
that are offline.

129
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:06,320
Well, you told us to postpone the work

130
00:09:06,391 --> 00:09:08,952
until we had a greater understanding
of the grid that powers the system...

131
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:10,120
With that many positions down,

132
00:09:10,196 --> 00:09:13,188
entire sections of this ship
are vulnerable to attack.

133
00:09:13,266 --> 00:09:17,101
Wasn't Dr. Kemp recently injured
working on this problem?

134
00:09:17,171 --> 00:09:20,196
Yeah, there was an unexpected surge
in one of the conduits.

135
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:22,968
There's also the risk
of a much more catastrophic overload...

136
00:09:23,043 --> 00:09:24,670
Irrelevant. Fix it.

137
00:09:24,745 --> 00:09:27,714
- We don't even know what's wrong with it.
- Weapons are a priority.

138
00:09:27,781 --> 00:09:30,113
A new home for hydroponics can wait.

139
00:09:30,384 --> 00:09:31,874
Dismissed.

140
00:09:41,396 --> 00:09:43,990
- What was that?
- Don't start, Camile.

141
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:48,134
That work is dangerous.
You shut it down for a reason.

142
00:09:48,204 --> 00:09:50,638
We need to be able to defend ourselves.

143
00:09:50,706 --> 00:09:53,174
After everything that we've been through,
that should be obvious.

144
00:09:53,242 --> 00:09:56,234
Yeah, you know what? You're right.
We have been through a lot.

145
00:09:57,046 --> 00:09:58,139
You, especially.

146
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,813
Is this you acting as ship's therapist now?

147
00:10:02,284 --> 00:10:04,310
I know you, Everett.

148
00:10:04,387 --> 00:10:06,514
You hold yourself responsible
for everything,

149
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:09,582
including what happened
to T.J. and the baby.

150
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:12,856
But if it's starting to cloud
your judgment, I need to know.

151
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:15,563
I'm fine.

152
00:10:27,111 --> 00:10:28,545
I brought you some food.

153
00:10:29,615 --> 00:10:31,138
I'm not hungry.

154
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:35,520
Okay, then how about some company?

155
00:10:39,224 --> 00:10:41,920
I've been working
on some fairly interesting equations.

156
00:10:43,495 --> 00:10:45,760
I thought you may want to take a look.

157
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:48,862
You've got to be kidding me.

158
00:10:52,205 --> 00:10:53,969
I'm not the one keeping you in here.

159
00:10:55,008 --> 00:10:58,136
- I tried to help you.
- What, with the chair?

160
00:10:59,647 --> 00:11:02,013
Was that even real or was it just for show?

161
00:11:02,248 --> 00:11:04,113
Of course it was real.

162
00:11:08,155 --> 00:11:11,022
You know, it's pointless trying
to deny the advantages of your situation.

163
00:11:12,493 --> 00:11:15,088
I mean, just ask Lieutenant Scott.

164
00:11:15,163 --> 00:11:19,532
If the chair had worked,
well, he'd be dead right now.

165
00:11:19,601 --> 00:11:22,092
Do you even know
what's really happening to me?

166
00:11:23,238 --> 00:11:27,902
Obviously you're undergoing
quite significant physiological changes,

167
00:11:27,976 --> 00:11:29,238
most notably in your brain.

168
00:11:32,181 --> 00:11:34,740
I haven't given up hope
of finding a solution.

169
00:11:34,984 --> 00:11:36,747
But in the meantime,

170
00:11:37,153 --> 00:11:40,282
I would've thought you would at least
want to try and keep yourself occupied.

171
00:11:43,092 --> 00:11:46,551
My research has taken
a very interesting turn.

172
00:11:48,465 --> 00:11:50,159
I may be on the verge

173
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:54,694
<i>of discovering the true nature
of Destiny's mission.</i>

174
00:11:58,575 --> 00:12:02,012
See, here. These numbers haven't been
corrected for gravitational time dilation.

175
00:12:02,647 --> 00:12:07,084
Obviously it depends on the size of the star,
but it could make a pretty big difference.

176
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:09,142
Huh. How'd I miss that?

177
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,687
Well, your math is always perfect,

178
00:12:11,757 --> 00:12:15,317
but sometimes you lose sight
of the context.

179
00:12:17,563 --> 00:12:20,589
Like I said, I've been studying your work.

180
00:12:22,368 --> 00:12:23,858
You didn't have anything better to do?

181
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:30,306
I like numbers and equations.
I always have, ever since I was little.

182
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:33,778
They don't lie.

183
00:12:38,385 --> 00:12:40,683
When I was a kid, I wanted to be a vet.

184
00:12:42,156 --> 00:12:43,885
Animal doctor. Uh...

185
00:12:44,692 --> 00:12:49,026
So, my mom bought me a hamster,
you know, to teach responsibility.

186
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,696
I left the cage door open
and my dad stepped on him.

187
00:12:54,201 --> 00:12:55,463
That was the end of that career.

188
00:12:55,536 --> 00:12:57,801
Well, I'm sure you would have made
a very good doctor.

189
00:13:02,411 --> 00:13:07,509
Anyway, if it wasn't for the, uh, hamster?

190
00:13:08,484 --> 00:13:10,951
It's like a small rodent.

191
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,221
Well, if it wasn't for him,
none of us would be here.

192
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:21,793
Never thought of that. That's really weird.

193
00:13:23,834 --> 00:13:24,822
I don't...

194
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,314
<i>Colonel
Young, come in.</i>

195
00:13:48,526 --> 00:13:50,892
<i>Colonel Young, this is Brody
in the Control Interface Room.</i>

196
00:13:50,962 --> 00:13:52,224
<i>Please respond.</i>

197
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,299
This is Young.

198
00:13:56,935 --> 00:13:58,961
<i>We've got a bit of a situation here.</i>

199
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,771
They want us to hand over Chloe.

200
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,276
What if all this time they were slowly
changing her to one of them,

201
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,835
- and now they want her back?
- She's not one of them.

202
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:12,177
Colonel. What should we do?

203
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:16,656
- Maybe we should power the weapons?
- No, that won't work.

204
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,325
We've still got 44 minutes
until the next jump.

205
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:20,552
We have to do something.

206
00:14:26,601 --> 00:14:27,794
That was a warning shot.

207
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,094
We're getting another message.

208
00:14:31,072 --> 00:14:33,438
It says if we don't comply,
they'll destroy us.

209
00:14:33,508 --> 00:14:35,567
<i>They're bluffing. They want
Destiny more than anything.</i>

210
00:14:36,544 --> 00:14:38,409
- What's happening?
- We're surrounded by alien ships.

211
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:40,675
They want us to hand over Chloe.

212
00:14:40,749 --> 00:14:43,047
I suggest we shut down
all non-essential systems,

213
00:14:43,118 --> 00:14:45,279
devote every scrap of power to the shields.

214
00:14:46,188 --> 00:14:47,951
Let's do that. Let's do it.

215
00:14:56,065 --> 00:14:58,260
I don't think that's the response
they were looking for.

216
00:14:58,334 --> 00:15:00,894
It doesn't matter.
The shields are holding.

217
00:15:11,782 --> 00:15:14,376
They don't have enough firepower.
We're going to make it to the jump.

218
00:15:15,052 --> 00:15:16,519
We've got more ships incoming.

219
00:15:23,727 --> 00:15:26,458
I'm now reading 15 ships total.
They're all firing.

220
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,769
I thought we agreed that
they didn't want to destroy us!

221
00:15:30,836 --> 00:15:34,567
Not intentionally. They'd have to collapse
the shields in order to board the ship.

222
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,308
We have secondary explosions
in the engineering area.

223
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:42,677
Power's overloading
in the sublight drive. It's going critical.

224
00:15:42,748 --> 00:15:44,978
Emergency shutdown. Now!

225
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,914
It's too late.

226
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,316
- Colonel...
- Well, you wanted to be a shrink.

227
00:16:17,386 --> 00:16:18,852
Now here's your chance.

228
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,587
What are you talking about?
What's going on?

229
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,554
I think I might be going insane.

230
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:28,555
You've been drinking.

231
00:16:28,631 --> 00:16:31,225
That's not the problem.
That's just one of the symptoms.

232
00:16:31,434 --> 00:16:34,800
No, what I'm saying is
that maybe now's not the best time.

233
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,839
Yeah. All right.

234
00:16:36,907 --> 00:16:39,842
Well, I, uh...

235
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,539
I've been having
this recurring dream,

236
00:16:43,613 --> 00:16:46,207
only it's more than a dream.

237
00:16:46,283 --> 00:16:50,481
It's real. It's about as real as it gets.

238
00:16:51,187 --> 00:16:53,088
Okay. What's it about?

239
00:16:53,624 --> 00:16:57,721
The aliens from the other galaxy,
they catch up to us.

240
00:16:57,795 --> 00:17:00,889
They surround the ship,
and then they ask me to hand over Chloe.

241
00:17:01,499 --> 00:17:05,231
And, now, the first time,
I try to fight them off,

242
00:17:05,304 --> 00:17:07,134
the ship gets destroyed.

243
00:17:07,205 --> 00:17:12,473
The second time, I go into a defensive
shell, but the ship still gets destroyed.

244
00:17:12,545 --> 00:17:14,011
Wait a minute.

245
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,879
Is that why you ordered Park and her team
to resume work on the weapons grid?

246
00:17:18,952 --> 00:17:20,146
Because of this dream?

247
00:17:20,219 --> 00:17:23,154
Listen. There's something else
going on here.

248
00:17:24,023 --> 00:17:26,583
I mean, this is like no dream
I've ever had before.

249
00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:30,117
I mean, I can feel the floor under my feet.

250
00:17:30,196 --> 00:17:33,189
I can smell the sweat
of the people around me, Camile.

251
00:17:34,635 --> 00:17:37,195
Yeah, yeah. It's a no-win scenario.

252
00:17:38,405 --> 00:17:39,963
It seems like the only way out would be

253
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,668
for you to do the one thing
that you don't want to do.

254
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,377
I don't think it's that simple.

255
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:52,219
Have you even spoken to Chloe since
you've confined her in her quarters?

256
00:17:52,754 --> 00:17:53,778
No.

257
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,390
Well, maybe that would be
a good place to start.

258
00:18:01,763 --> 00:18:03,128
Hey.

259
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:09,161
Wow, another visitor.
Hmm. I've never been so popular.

260
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:11,832
Well, listen, you know, I'm sorry
that I haven't come to see you before.

261
00:18:11,907 --> 00:18:13,101
I've been busy.

262
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:19,471
Also, it's hard for me.

263
00:18:21,318 --> 00:18:23,445
Because of what you might have to do.

264
00:18:27,991 --> 00:18:31,792
You know, I...
I was feeling sorry for myself,

265
00:18:32,363 --> 00:18:33,989
being stuck in this room,

266
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,228
but then I remembered
how everyone looked at me

267
00:18:39,304 --> 00:18:42,101
when they found out I was still infected.

268
00:18:43,674 --> 00:18:45,165
I think I'm better off in here.

269
00:18:45,911 --> 00:18:48,845
Really? You know that the people
on this ship care about you.

270
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,512
They're afraid of me.

271
00:18:53,385 --> 00:18:54,785
I'm afraid of me.

272
00:18:56,989 --> 00:18:58,422
Nobody's given up hope here.

273
00:18:58,724 --> 00:19:00,124
I know.

274
00:19:01,394 --> 00:19:06,764
But if there's no solution, if I keep changing,
sooner or later, you won't have a choice.

275
00:19:16,744 --> 00:19:19,474
Hey. Sorry.

276
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,619
- So?
- So, what?

277
00:19:27,889 --> 00:19:29,253
When are you gonna make a move?

278
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,018
What are you talking about?

279
00:19:33,095 --> 00:19:35,120
Ginn. The girl's into you.

280
00:19:36,231 --> 00:19:39,723
And you know this from watching us
work together for, what, two days?

281
00:19:39,801 --> 00:19:41,394
I knew after 10 minutes.

282
00:19:42,071 --> 00:19:43,470
The girl loves math, Eli.

283
00:19:47,176 --> 00:19:50,407
And if ever you were gonna have
a chance with anyone, this is probably it.

284
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,913
Thanks.

285
00:19:55,585 --> 00:19:56,917
Tell you what.

286
00:19:57,788 --> 00:20:01,781
The next time we're together,
I'll arrange to get called away.

287
00:20:05,729 --> 00:20:08,425
Okay. But don't make it too obvious.

288
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,694
Obvious is good.

289
00:20:17,609 --> 00:20:19,099
Time to man up.

290
00:20:35,427 --> 00:20:37,760
<i>Colonel
Young, come in.</i>

291
00:20:39,131 --> 00:20:41,361
<i>Colonel Young, this is Brody
in the Control Interface Room.</i>

292
00:20:41,433 --> 00:20:42,867
<i>Please respond.</i>

293
00:20:49,042 --> 00:20:51,875
- What's happening?
We're surrounded by alien ships.

294
00:20:51,945 --> 00:20:55,312
They want us to hand over Chloe.

295
00:20:55,615 --> 00:20:57,777
I suggest shutting down
all non-essential systems,

296
00:20:57,852 --> 00:20:59,945
devote every scrap of power to the shields.

297
00:21:00,254 --> 00:21:02,814
No, that's not going to work.
More ships are coming.

298
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:04,924
Well, how could you possibly know that?

299
00:21:04,992 --> 00:21:07,587
If we power the weapons or the shields
or provoke them in any way,

300
00:21:07,663 --> 00:21:10,063
they will open fire and destroy all of us.

301
00:21:12,466 --> 00:21:14,128
So, what do we do?

302
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,204
I guess it's time.

303
00:21:31,287 --> 00:21:33,483
<i>Colonel, this is Brody.
You were right.</i>

304
00:21:33,557 --> 00:21:36,218
<i>Another half-dozen ships
just dropped out of hyperspace.</i>

305
00:21:36,392 --> 00:21:38,918
<i>- Are they sending over a shuttle?
- It's on its way.</i>

306
00:21:41,332 --> 00:21:43,926
Dial back the shield strength
over the hull breach.

307
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:24,308
- What did you do?
- I didn't have a choice.

308
00:22:24,378 --> 00:22:25,902
You son of a bitch!

309
00:22:26,213 --> 00:22:27,339
Lieutenant, no!

310
00:22:28,248 --> 00:22:29,409
No!

311
00:22:32,286 --> 00:22:35,017
<i>Colonel, we've got a problem.
More alien shuttles are approaching.</i>

312
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:36,249
<i>A lot more.</i>

313
00:22:42,263 --> 00:22:44,527
<i>Colonel Young,
are you reading me? Colonel?</i>

314
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:45,861
This is Scott. What's happening?

315
00:22:45,967 --> 00:22:49,403
<i>This is Rush. Power's down all over
the ship, including shields.</i>

316
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,563
<i>We can't restore them.</i>

317
00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:53,233
<i>Chloe must have discovered how
and passed along the information.</i>

318
00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:56,244
Get down to the armory,
break out every weapon we've got.

319
00:22:56,312 --> 00:22:58,610
Organize defense teams.
We're about to be boarded.

320
00:22:59,415 --> 00:23:00,713
Yes, sir.

321
00:23:10,927 --> 00:23:12,952
<i>We've got another
hull breach near the infirmary!</i>

322
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:14,291
<i>Fall back to my position!</i>

323
00:23:14,364 --> 00:23:17,129
<i>This is Rush. We have to defend
the Gate Room at all costs!</i>

324
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,498
<i>There's too many!
We can't hold them!</i>

325
00:23:43,962 --> 00:23:45,429
Colonel?

326
00:23:46,332 --> 00:23:48,630
Hey. Hey, what are you doing here?

327
00:23:49,868 --> 00:23:53,737
Picking up a batch Brody made for me.
Extra strong. I use it for disinfectant.

328
00:23:57,377 --> 00:23:58,401
You don't look so good.

329
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:02,142
Yeah, I know.
I guess it's that obvious, huh?

330
00:24:05,218 --> 00:24:10,418
Everett, what if I told you that the baby,
our baby, is still alive?

331
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,320
I mean, I don't know.
Why would... Why would you do that?

332
00:24:14,428 --> 00:24:15,622
Because I saw her.

333
00:24:16,931 --> 00:24:19,456
Because I held her in my arms
and she's beautiful...

334
00:24:19,534 --> 00:24:22,196
- T.J.
- It's like nothing you can imagine.

335
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,534
We were on the planet
where we left Caine and the others,

336
00:24:24,606 --> 00:24:26,665
and the aliens there,
they said that they would take care of her.

337
00:24:26,741 --> 00:24:27,970
Caine promised me.

338
00:24:28,977 --> 00:24:31,138
- Then they sent me back here.
- You never left the ship.

339
00:24:31,212 --> 00:24:32,441
I know...

340
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:37,083
Look, I know. I know what it sounds like and
that's why I didn't say anything before,

341
00:24:37,153 --> 00:24:39,212
because I knew that
you would think I was crazy.

342
00:24:39,955 --> 00:24:42,982
But I'm not. I'm not crazy,

343
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,850
and it wasn't a dream.

344
00:24:45,928 --> 00:24:48,193
Why is it so hard to believe
after everything that we've seen

345
00:24:48,265 --> 00:24:50,290
- since we've been here...
- Hey, listen to me!

346
00:24:51,701 --> 00:24:56,764
Just because you want something to be true
it doesn't mean it is, T.J. Okay?

347
00:24:57,875 --> 00:25:00,365
Okay. You listen to me.

348
00:25:02,446 --> 00:25:05,007
I can see where you're going.

349
00:25:05,917 --> 00:25:08,181
I know, because I almost went there.

350
00:25:09,687 --> 00:25:11,814
I'm afraid that you won't come back.

351
00:25:14,793 --> 00:25:16,089
I'm sorry.

352
00:25:24,403 --> 00:25:25,893
That's weird.

353
00:25:26,605 --> 00:25:27,594
What?

354
00:25:27,673 --> 00:25:29,232
The computer's using a ton of memory

355
00:25:29,309 --> 00:25:31,833
running a program
I've never even seen before.

356
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,744
Maybe some kind of auto-diagnostic?
I don't...

357
00:25:34,814 --> 00:25:37,578
I have to ask. What are all these pictures?

358
00:25:38,752 --> 00:25:41,151
Oh, those are stills from my movie.

359
00:25:42,055 --> 00:25:43,488
My documentary.

360
00:25:45,493 --> 00:25:47,517
I've been trying to keep
a record of everything

361
00:25:47,594 --> 00:25:50,359
that's been happening
to us, using the Kino.

362
00:25:50,664 --> 00:25:51,756
Here.

363
00:25:56,237 --> 00:25:57,465
Oh, see?

364
00:25:57,538 --> 00:25:58,766
<i>Nobody wants to see this.</i>

365
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:01,968
<i>No, no, it's the little things
that make all the difference.</i>

366
00:26:02,711 --> 00:26:03,870
<i>Fine.</i>

367
00:26:03,944 --> 00:26:07,073
<i>Ancient toilets. Here we go.</i>

368
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,486
Anyway, you get the idea.

369
00:26:12,554 --> 00:26:14,921
<i>Sergeant
Greer, come in.</i>

370
00:26:15,525 --> 00:26:16,651
Go ahead.

371
00:26:16,726 --> 00:26:19,661
<i>There's a problem in the mess.
We need your assistance.</i>

372
00:26:21,297 --> 00:26:22,696
On my way.

373
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:25,125
- You're leaving?
- Could take a while.

374
00:26:33,377 --> 00:26:34,743
One second?

375
00:26:47,292 --> 00:26:51,058
Whoa, whoa. Uh, I'm not so sure about this.

376
00:26:51,162 --> 00:26:53,460
- You'll thank me later.
- But what am I supposed to say?

377
00:26:53,531 --> 00:26:55,557
The girl's from another planet.

378
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:01,940
I guess I'm supposed
to tell you to be yourself,

379
00:27:02,007 --> 00:27:04,305
but in your case...

380
00:27:05,745 --> 00:27:07,905
<i>So my mom just left.</i>

381
00:27:09,949 --> 00:27:15,114
<i>It was good to see her
even though she was in Park's body.</i>

382
00:27:16,957 --> 00:27:18,424
<i>Little weird.</i>

383
00:27:20,126 --> 00:27:21,389
<i>Anyway...</i>

384
00:27:23,597 --> 00:27:24,825
<i>I think it helped.</i>

385
00:27:28,369 --> 00:27:30,131
<i>At least I hope so.</i>

386
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,603
- Okay, I got this.
- You got this?

387
00:27:33,407 --> 00:27:35,967
- How long are you gonna be?
- How long you gonna need?

388
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:40,070
I'll take my time.

389
00:27:45,053 --> 00:27:48,113
<i>It's hard. You know?</i>

390
00:27:49,858 --> 00:27:54,352
<i>I mean, I know that we're
several billion light years apart</i>

391
00:27:54,429 --> 00:27:57,160
<i>and, well, that may never change...</i>

392
00:28:01,571 --> 00:28:05,803
<i>But I... I just need to know
that she's still there.</i>

393
00:28:08,846 --> 00:28:11,780
<i>You know... 'Cause if she's not...</i>

394
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:14,246
<i>Then I don't have...</i>

395
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:18,812
Sorry. I didn't know that it was going
to be anything that personal.

396
00:28:18,889 --> 00:28:21,255
No, no, that's... That's not your fault.

397
00:28:22,894 --> 00:28:24,327
Real smooth, though, huh?

398
00:28:24,396 --> 00:28:27,057
A grown man crying about his mom?

399
00:28:27,131 --> 00:28:28,656
Suave.

400
00:28:30,435 --> 00:28:33,269
I might as well
just get Greer to come back.

401
00:28:33,371 --> 00:28:34,736
What do you mean?

402
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:38,041
Never mind.

403
00:29:08,609 --> 00:29:09,906
Colonel?

404
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,478
Colonel, are you in there?

405
00:29:18,821 --> 00:29:20,686
Yeah. What do you need?

406
00:29:23,124 --> 00:29:28,153
Uh, the ship, it dropped out,
but there's no gates in range.

407
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,697
Brody says we're just drifting.

408
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:32,597
Well, that doesn't sound so bad.

409
00:29:33,368 --> 00:29:36,236
Except there's no countdown clock.
We have no idea how long it's going to last.

410
00:29:36,805 --> 00:29:38,238
You figure it out.

411
00:29:39,375 --> 00:29:40,603
Sir?

412
00:29:46,416 --> 00:29:47,713
Problems?

413
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,317
Well, the ship doesn't drop
out of FTL for no reason.

414
00:29:52,388 --> 00:29:54,619
Unless you tell it to.

415
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:57,126
Yeah, well, this time, it wasn't me,
and I can't find anything wrong

416
00:29:57,194 --> 00:29:58,957
with navigation or propulsion.

417
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,355
Maybe you need to look somewhere else.

418
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:07,935
As far as I can tell,
there's nothing interfering

419
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:10,099
with the normal operation of the FTL drive.

420
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:13,171
- The ship just doesn't want to go anywhere.
- What about a dial-in?

421
00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:14,713
Gate's quiet.

422
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,808
Where's Young?
- He's not feeling well.

423
00:30:21,587 --> 00:30:23,714
- All right, what's new?
- So far, we've got nothing.

424
00:30:24,723 --> 00:30:26,055
What about you?

425
00:30:27,293 --> 00:30:28,453
Eli?

426
00:30:29,629 --> 00:30:33,156
Well, I've been working
with that Lucian Alliance girl, Ginn?

427
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:36,861
Actually, it's gone a little bit
beyond just working together.

428
00:30:36,937 --> 00:30:39,735
- I don't want to jinx it, but she's...
- Eli.

429
00:30:43,977 --> 00:30:47,573
Anyway, we've been running a series of
programs that were designed for modeling.

430
00:30:47,714 --> 00:30:51,583
You know, simulation.
It was really sluggish.

431
00:30:51,653 --> 00:30:53,211
And I couldn't figure out why.

432
00:30:53,321 --> 00:30:57,348
And then I realized that the computer
was running a simulation of its own.

433
00:30:58,393 --> 00:30:59,690
What kind of simulation?

434
00:31:00,228 --> 00:31:02,925
I just figured that out now.
It's a battle scenario.

435
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:04,956
<i>The Destiny drops out of FTL,</i>

436
00:31:05,033 --> 00:31:07,867
and then it's immediately surrounded
by alien ships.

437
00:31:07,937 --> 00:31:11,703
It's run through several different
variations, different scenarios,

438
00:31:11,774 --> 00:31:14,038
but it always ends badly.

439
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:15,942
Oh, my God.

440
00:31:17,013 --> 00:31:19,311
Are you talking about the aliens
from the other galaxy,

441
00:31:19,381 --> 00:31:21,816
the ones that took Chloe and Rush?

442
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:24,611
Yeah, same guys.

443
00:31:26,056 --> 00:31:27,217
Camile, what is it?

444
00:31:31,027 --> 00:31:34,020
- A battle simulation.
Exactly.

445
00:31:34,098 --> 00:31:36,794
Extremely complex,
modeled down to the last detail,

446
00:31:36,868 --> 00:31:38,961
and always with an unfortunate result.

447
00:31:39,904 --> 00:31:43,465
Well, it's interesting, but what's it
got to do with the ship dropping out?

448
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:45,133
Look closer.

449
00:31:57,824 --> 00:32:00,917
Something about this program
is overriding normal operations.

450
00:32:01,093 --> 00:32:02,925
Which leaves only one question.

451
00:32:05,431 --> 00:32:06,728
Why?

452
00:32:08,034 --> 00:32:11,595
Okay, so you're telling me the ship
is affecting the Colonel's dreams?

453
00:32:11,671 --> 00:32:13,401
It's the only explanation.

454
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:16,632
It's not impossible.
Brain waves are just electrical impulses,

455
00:32:16,709 --> 00:32:20,703
so theoretically, they could be
manipulated, if you knew how.

456
00:32:21,382 --> 00:32:23,646
<i>Maybe it's Destiny's
way of warning us.</i>

457
00:32:24,385 --> 00:32:25,875
What if it knows the aliens are coming?

458
00:32:25,953 --> 00:32:28,445
No, there's no way
they could have followed us.

459
00:32:31,091 --> 00:32:34,391
No, I told you already. I don't remember
anything about the blackouts.

460
00:32:34,529 --> 00:32:37,761
Look, I need you to think, Chloe.
This is very important.

461
00:32:39,367 --> 00:32:41,858
When James was under the influence
of those aliens,

462
00:32:41,937 --> 00:32:44,600
she managed to send them
some kind of a signal.

463
00:32:45,308 --> 00:32:47,138
Is it possible you could have
done the same thing?

464
00:32:51,881 --> 00:32:53,713
I don't remember.

465
00:32:55,885 --> 00:32:58,149
Eli, this is Scott. Prep the weapons.

466
00:32:58,255 --> 00:33:00,280
Bypass any batteries that aren't 100%,

467
00:33:00,357 --> 00:33:01,847
devote the remaining power to the rest.

468
00:33:01,959 --> 00:33:05,918
Shut down all non-essential systems and
put everything you can into the shields.

469
00:33:05,996 --> 00:33:07,987
<i>Understood.</i>

470
00:33:10,067 --> 00:33:12,501
Going on patrol in teams of three.

471
00:33:12,569 --> 00:33:14,970
Lieutenant James, here,
has your assignments.

472
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:19,135
Now, if they do come, it is a pretty safe bet
they are going to try and board this ship.

473
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:21,838
Makes us the last line of defense.
Any questions?

474
00:33:21,913 --> 00:33:24,041
All right. Dismissed.

475
00:33:24,616 --> 00:33:26,446
Okay, let's go.

476
00:33:26,517 --> 00:33:29,180
Camile, I need you to
organize the civilians.

477
00:33:29,254 --> 00:33:31,552
I want everyone in designated areas
till further notice.

478
00:33:31,623 --> 00:33:33,318
There's something else
we need to talk about.

479
00:33:33,392 --> 00:33:35,019
- Can it wait?
- No.

480
00:33:41,967 --> 00:33:43,434
I know what you're going to say.

481
00:33:43,802 --> 00:33:45,464
- Where is he?
- I can handle this.

482
00:33:45,538 --> 00:33:48,871
Well, that's the point.
You can. Evidently he can't.

483
00:33:49,943 --> 00:33:52,434
You have to assume command officially.

484
00:33:52,545 --> 00:33:53,842
I can't do that.

485
00:33:54,347 --> 00:33:55,440
Well, what if this is a test?

486
00:33:55,516 --> 00:33:57,710
These dreams the Colonel's been having.

487
00:33:57,851 --> 00:34:00,753
- A test of his emotional stability.
- A test he's failing.

488
00:34:01,422 --> 00:34:03,185
Where is this coming from?

489
00:34:03,257 --> 00:34:06,283
Think about it.
What is the Colonel doing right now?

490
00:34:06,394 --> 00:34:08,157
He's locked himself away. He's shut down.

491
00:34:08,229 --> 00:34:11,028
And at the exact same time,
the ship came to a dead stop,

492
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:13,692
and now we're floating
aimlessly in empty space.

493
00:34:13,768 --> 00:34:15,964
<i>Destiny is beginning
to understand us.</i>

494
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:19,372
Who we are, what makes us tick.

495
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:23,669
What, you're telling me the ship
wants me to replace him?

496
00:34:23,745 --> 00:34:25,373
No, no.

497
00:34:25,448 --> 00:34:29,850
It's not as if it has desires or emotions.

498
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,853
It has no personality.

499
00:34:31,921 --> 00:34:35,084
But it is capable of analyzing
all manner of sensory input.

500
00:34:35,592 --> 00:34:37,456
It knows we're here.

501
00:34:37,527 --> 00:34:40,394
It's beginning to understand
what effect we might be having.

502
00:34:40,464 --> 00:34:42,295
Why not one of you?

503
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:47,268
Well, we've been down that road before.
None too successful.

504
00:34:47,404 --> 00:34:50,168
I thought this was about aliens.

505
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,334
I thought this was a warning
to prepare us for an attack.

506
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:55,640
Either way, a warning, a test,

507
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,312
we need a strong leader right now.

508
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:01,445
I don't like it anymore than you do,

509
00:35:01,786 --> 00:35:03,913
but I don't think you have a choice.

510
00:35:09,227 --> 00:35:10,455
Colonel?

511
00:35:16,336 --> 00:35:18,826
Colonel, I'm not going away
till you open this door!

512
00:35:23,009 --> 00:35:24,340
I brought you some tea.

513
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:27,812
It's really strong stuff,
closest thing to coffee we had.

514
00:35:27,881 --> 00:35:30,714
Oh, thanks, Lieutenant.
I'll pass on the tea.

515
00:35:30,817 --> 00:35:32,682
Sir, we have a situation here.

516
00:35:32,752 --> 00:35:35,312
You need to clean yourself up
and get back out there.

517
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:39,358
What are you doing?
Are you giving me an order, Lieutenant?

518
00:35:39,427 --> 00:35:42,362
Sir, these dreams you're having.
The battle scenario.

519
00:35:42,997 --> 00:35:47,594
It's the ship. It's affecting your brain waves.
It's a simulation.

520
00:35:47,669 --> 00:35:49,226
It's a simulation?
What does that even mean?

521
00:35:49,303 --> 00:35:50,395
Eli found the program.

522
00:35:50,471 --> 00:35:52,770
It is the exact same thing
you described to Camile.

523
00:35:52,841 --> 00:35:53,933
It can't be a coincidence.

524
00:35:54,009 --> 00:35:57,137
Boy, I guess the ship has
some sense of humor. Yeah.

525
00:35:59,047 --> 00:36:01,743
She thinks your reaction,
the fact that you've...

526
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:05,419
Well, you've given up,
it's the reason why we have dropped out,

527
00:36:05,487 --> 00:36:07,479
why we are stuck out here
in the middle of nowhere.

528
00:36:07,557 --> 00:36:09,320
Now, if you pull yourself together,

529
00:36:09,392 --> 00:36:11,724
you start acting like a real commander,
maybe we can get going again.

530
00:36:11,793 --> 00:36:16,231
<i>Or maybe that's just Destiny's way
of telling me that I need to be replaced.</i>

531
00:36:16,332 --> 00:36:17,526
That's what Rush said.

532
00:36:17,835 --> 00:36:21,133
- Is that what Rush said?
- But I'm not going to do that.

533
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:24,566
Are you in love with Chloe?

534
00:36:25,676 --> 00:36:27,734
It's a simple question. Do you love her?

535
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:30,040
- Yes.
- Yes.

536
00:36:30,114 --> 00:36:32,582
So how are you going to feel
when I have to drop her off this ship,

537
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,482
put her on some rock,
and you know it's coming.

538
00:36:34,553 --> 00:36:37,385
She knows it's coming,
we all know it's coming,

539
00:36:37,721 --> 00:36:39,917
but I got to do it.

540
00:36:39,991 --> 00:36:43,757
You still going to look up to me then.
You still going to think, "Hey!"

541
00:36:43,828 --> 00:36:45,557
Tell everyone what a great
commander I am?

542
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:47,393
Are you, Lieutenant?

543
00:36:47,465 --> 00:36:49,297
Don't... Don't do this.

544
00:36:49,368 --> 00:36:51,961
I'm sorry that you didn't have
a father growing up,

545
00:36:52,037 --> 00:36:53,665
but I didn't volunteer for that either.

546
00:36:55,107 --> 00:36:59,101
There you go. Now we're talking.
Hit me. Hit me!

547
00:36:59,979 --> 00:37:04,417
No one asked for this,
but you are the commanding officer.

548
00:37:04,484 --> 00:37:06,349
You don't get to feel sorry for yourself.

549
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,319
And if you don't like it, too bad.

550
00:37:10,123 --> 00:37:11,886
I killed Riley.

551
00:37:13,327 --> 00:37:16,160
- That wasn't your fault.
- I know it wasn't my fault.

552
00:37:16,663 --> 00:37:18,460
No, he knew it. That's...

553
00:37:18,532 --> 00:37:21,127
He didn't want to die alone.
That's why he asked me.

554
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:26,031
But I killed him.
I suffocated him with my own hands.

555
00:37:30,546 --> 00:37:32,638
On top of everything else, it's just...

556
00:37:34,783 --> 00:37:37,115
You know, it adds up.

557
00:37:42,191 --> 00:37:43,715
I need you to leave.

558
00:37:47,763 --> 00:37:49,253
Look, you're right.

559
00:37:50,867 --> 00:37:54,394
I couldn't do it,
live with the burden every day.

560
00:37:54,471 --> 00:37:58,532
That is not me or T.J., or Camile.

561
00:37:58,608 --> 00:38:01,271
- Rush could do it.
- For Rush, it wouldn't be a burden.

562
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:03,679
That is why we need you,

563
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:05,306
because you feel it.

564
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:08,416
But not so much you can't get up
and do it all over again the next day.

565
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:11,421
Really? You sure?
You sure about that, Lieutenant?

566
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:14,925
A real leader, a good commander,

567
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:19,156
is not so callous that he stops caring,

568
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:22,089
just enough so he can keep on going.

569
00:38:23,035 --> 00:38:26,562
And we both know
you are a good commander.

570
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:34,543
It is never going to stop hurting.

571
00:38:36,049 --> 00:38:37,482
That's the whole point.

572
00:38:38,384 --> 00:38:42,445
For the sake of everyone on this ship
you are going to have to live with it.

573
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:18,251
But we've got five down by the mess.
So if we take...

574
00:39:20,896 --> 00:39:23,091
Mr. Brody, what's our status?

575
00:39:25,101 --> 00:39:28,003
Well, uh, still no sign of the aliens.

576
00:39:28,071 --> 00:39:29,765
The ship's main weapon is online,

577
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:32,400
and we've diverted as much power
as we can to the shields.

578
00:39:32,476 --> 00:39:36,879
Sir, we have all available military
personnel patrolling the gaps

579
00:39:36,947 --> 00:39:39,415
between the active weapons batteries,
but it's a lot of real estate.

580
00:39:39,483 --> 00:39:41,974
We could go to two-man teams,
cover a little more ground,

581
00:39:42,052 --> 00:39:44,521
but we'd be stretching ourselves
pretty thin.

582
00:39:44,589 --> 00:39:48,286
Well, let's do it. If there is a breach,
I would rather be on it fast

583
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:50,827
with a little less firepower
than the other way around.

584
00:39:50,895 --> 00:39:54,296
Also, let's break out whatever spare
ordinance we have from the Lucian Alliance

585
00:39:54,365 --> 00:39:56,356
and arm as many civilians as possible.

586
00:39:56,434 --> 00:39:58,835
- Well, they don't have a lot of training.
- I'll command them myself.

587
00:39:58,904 --> 00:40:02,066
We'll stick to defensive positions
between here and the Gate Room.

588
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,130
They'll be fine.

589
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:04,602
Yes, sir.

590
00:40:06,712 --> 00:40:07,771
Anything else?

591
00:40:16,855 --> 00:40:20,519
We just jumped. We're back in FTL.

592
00:40:22,562 --> 00:40:24,121
It's good to have you back, sir.

593
00:40:32,739 --> 00:40:35,072
Hey, I'm happy as the next guy
that we're back on track.

594
00:40:35,142 --> 00:40:37,042
I'm just saying that I'm not
so comfortable knowing

595
00:40:37,111 --> 00:40:39,945
<i>that Destiny can get
in our heads like that.</i>

596
00:40:40,015 --> 00:40:42,039
I don't want to start second-guessing
my own dreams.

597
00:40:42,116 --> 00:40:44,847
Well, what have you been dreaming about?

598
00:40:46,955 --> 00:40:48,217
That's not the point.

599
00:40:48,657 --> 00:40:52,286
At least now we know once and for all
that we got the right man in command.

600
00:40:54,997 --> 00:40:56,793
I mean, you were there. Tell them.

601
00:40:58,868 --> 00:41:01,962
Young showed up, started giving orders,
and the ship just went.

602
00:41:03,473 --> 00:41:05,532
If someone has a better explanation,
I'd like to hear it.

603
00:41:12,082 --> 00:41:15,449
Congratulations.
- Don't feel much like talking right now.

604
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:19,451
You managed to bypass the simulation
and get the ship going.

605
00:41:19,524 --> 00:41:22,890
Well, what choice did I have?
Lieutenant Scott wasn't going to step up.

606
00:41:24,127 --> 00:41:25,993
I couldn't leave us just sitting there.

607
00:41:26,064 --> 00:41:28,361
But you haven't solved the problem,

608
00:41:28,499 --> 00:41:31,435
and yet you're pressing ahead.
Isn't that a little dangerous?

609
00:41:33,371 --> 00:41:36,772
<i>Destiny was evaluating Colonel
Young's ability to command the crew.</i>

610
00:41:36,841 --> 00:41:39,811
But ultimately, I control the ship.

611
00:41:40,913 --> 00:41:43,473
- And the aliens?
- They were never a threat.

612
00:41:44,649 --> 00:41:48,609
If Chloe had managed to send a signal
telling them our position,

613
00:41:49,088 --> 00:41:50,920
it would have logged
on that screen right there.

614
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:53,516
Maybe...

615
00:41:55,629 --> 00:41:58,120
But just because one threat is behind you,

616
00:41:59,865 --> 00:42:01,458
doesn't mean there isn't another ahead.

617
00:43:29,095 --> 00:43:30,084
