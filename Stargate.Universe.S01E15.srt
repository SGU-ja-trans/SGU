00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,391
RUSH: This is what Destiny intended from
the moment it entered the star system.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,309
YOUNG: We are going to survive.
We are going to make it home.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,631
I'm telling you,
the ship came here for a reason!

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,995
RUSH: Destiny is powered
by the stars themselves.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,510
WRAY: He and Young
are bumping heads, yes.

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,511
Not sure which camp is the better choice.

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,439
YOUNG: We just pretend
nothing happened?

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,432
We need to be ready
for the next encounter.

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,629
For the sake of the crew.

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,629
For the sake of the crew.

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,549
I'm not sick.

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,519
What about the father?

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,756
RUSH: This is unlike any other kind of alien
technology we've encountered before.

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,432
If they're indigenous to
this part of the universe,

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,509
they might be willing to trade.

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,749
SCOTT: You lost the Kino?

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,308
No, I took a wrong turn
trying to steer it out.

18
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,595
I just need to take a look
and get my bearings.

19
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,792
ELI: We haven't found any other sort of exit
or access to ground level.

20
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,869
We're not going to make it.

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,279
Fire in the hole!

22
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,757
Doesn't look like
that had the desired effect.

23
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,034
We just made things a lot worse.

24
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,869
SCOTT: God be with you, Colonel.

25
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,835
- Riley.
- I think Eli would want someone

26
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,593
documenting the efforts
to rescue the team that was left behind.

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,433
Well, given that Eli is one of the team
that was left behind,

28
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,078
I would have thought he'd want everyone

29
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,515
doing anything possible
to help rescue them.

30
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,828
Well, you didn't like my idea.

31
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,070
Telling Destiny to go back
and pick them up isn't going to work.

32
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,674
- How do you know?
- Because I've already tried it!

33
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,472
I'm done.

34
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,675
The stargate aboard this ship
is much more primitive

35
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,035
than the later models
found in the Milky Way.

36
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,396
As you can see from this map,
each time Destiny stops,

37
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,869
it's in range of only a small group of gates.

38
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,235
That means the next time
we drop out of FTL,

39
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,872
the planet the team was stranded on
will no longer be in range of Destiny.

40
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,076
However, Dr. Rush and Mr. Brody
are working on...

41
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,915
That's weird.

42
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,630
- What happened?
- The battery must have died.

43
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,709
BRODY: Okay.

44
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,838
I just got this one
fresh out of the dispenser.

45
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,993
It wasn't me.

46
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,512
I am not the sort of person
who just jumps into bed with anyone.

47
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,715
I had thought we...

48
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,995
Colonel Young asked you to check on me,
didn't he?

49
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,310
Yes, but he's asking me to
keep tabs on everybody.

50
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,239
He believes in you.

51
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,719
Well, he doesn't have much choice.

52
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,952
I'm also here because I'm your friend.

53
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,472
I'm sorry, it's just that...

54
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,509
Rush, come in.

55
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,919
Yeah, we've got several systems down.

56
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,600
It looks like Destiny's activated
some kind of power-saving mode.

57
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,752
That's strange, because our reserves are
still at almost maximum current capacity

58
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,159
from the last recharge.

59
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,229
Life support's fine.

60
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,469
I should be able to work around it,

61
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,993
get the lights back on
in a couple of minutes.

62
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,794
Maybe we shouldn't.

63
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,917
- What?
- Work around it.

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,718
I mean, there's got to be a good reason
this is happening.

65
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,677
RILEY: This whole ship is falling apart.

66
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,877
Computers don't last forever.
Maybe it's a malfunction.

67
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,112
Well, we're not going to be able to
do anything in the dark.

68
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,191
ELI: We have two days of water, tops.

69
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,273
GREER: We'll find more.

70
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,033
SCOTT: Step one,
we get out of these tunnels.

71
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,279
ELI: We're off to a bad start.

72
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,112
SCOTT: We'll find food and water.

73
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,189
ELI: Can't turn the ship around.

74
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,032
Then we'll use the gates to catch up.

75
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,192
In order to connect the dots
between here and the Destiny,

76
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,998
there have to be gates
in range of each other

77
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,550
between this planet
and wherever Destiny stops next.

78
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,317
Plus, this remote only tells you
which gates are in range of this planet,

79
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,799
not where they are.

80
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,711
There's no way to know
which direction we'd be going.

81
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,359
And in case that's not bad enough,
we have no idea where Destiny went.

82
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,714
One step at a time.

83
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,313
Yeah, let's all try and
keep a positive attitude.

84
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,035
C4 blast could have destabilized
the whole place.

85
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,917
- That's just great.
- We had to take the risk.

86
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,994
- We're seriously...
- Eli.

87
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,157
All we can do right now is keep moving.

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,319
Son of a...

89
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,633
So, what do we know?

90
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,835
Not much.

91
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,434
Several nonessential systems
automatically shut down.

92
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,715
We still only have limited control.

93
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,552
How about rescuing the team
we left behind?

94
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,949
As I said, Colonel, we won't know
if the planet they were left on

95
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,793
is reachable
until we've dropped out of FTL.

96
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,074
ELI: This is crazy.

97
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,509
You'd think some of these tunnels
would lead somewhere.

98
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,068
No wonder the people that built this place
died out.

99
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,196
They probably all got lost down here.

100
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,669
Just wandered around thinking,

101
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,399
"If only we had thought to
put in a few more exits."

102
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,790
Or how about one of those maps you see
in a shopping mall, with a big red dot?

103
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,950
"You are here. " How hard is that?

104
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,076
I'd kill for a big red dot right now.

105
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,434
GREER: I can't take this anymore.

106
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,832
SCOTT: All right, let's stop,
take a quick breather. Five minutes.

107
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,955
ELI: Thank God.

108
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,594
Still looking for that Kino?

109
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,075
No.

110
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,073
So what are you doing?

111
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,791
I've been thinking about
using the gates, actually.

112
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,869
And?

113
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,597
I may have painted
an overly bleak picture before.

114
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,035
I'll admit, I was freaking out a bit.

115
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,029
SCOTT: And now?

116
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,759
Well, we do know that Destiny
is traveling down a path,

117
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,879
basically a corridor of gates
left behind by the ships

118
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,473
that were sent in advance.

119
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,712
It meanders somewhat, but generally,
it heads in one direction.

120
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,995
I mean, they wouldn't put
gates on every planet in every galaxy.

121
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,229
Obviously not.

122
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,392
People don't realize how big a galaxy is.

123
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,469
Anyway...

124
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,476
Let's say the gates
in range of the planet we're on

125
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,596
are in this circle.

126
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,835
This circle represents the gates
in range of Destiny

127
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,512
the next time it drops out of FTL.

128
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,033
Okay, so we need to get to that circle.

129
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,269
Yeah, right.

130
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,990
Now, hopefully, there are gates in range
of each other between these circles.

131
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,712
Once we are in range of Destiny,
the address will show up on here.

132
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,717
You see how easy it is
to make a simple map?

133
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,716
Okay, so how do we know
we're going the right way?

134
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,793
We don't,

135
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,997
but if we do go the wrong way,
we'll either run out of addresses

136
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,638
because we've hit the edge of the corridor

137
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,517
or we'll run into planets
we've been to before,

138
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,398
or at least addresses
I'll hopefully remember or recognize,

139
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,312
but at least it's a 50-50 shot.

140
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,749
Good.

141
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,714
All right, we should really get moving.

142
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,949
Why? It hasn't been five minutes.

143
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,268
Eli, seriously!

144
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,072
ELI: Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

145
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,799
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

146
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,949
Yeah.

147
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,313
Well, I suspected as much.

148
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,118
Well, if it's true...

149
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,235
I know.

150
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,914
You're not going to tell Young?

151
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,878
Well, it's not certain.

152
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,079
You have to tell him.

153
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,278
She's upset.

154
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,713
We all are.

155
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,199
But she's fine, though?

156
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,840
I mean, I don't have to
worry about putting her back out there?

157
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,429
No.

158
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,837
A few words of encouragement from you
wouldn't hurt, though.

159
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,512
She thinks you don't have
any confidence in her,

160
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,955
that you're only putting her out there
because you don't have a choice.

161
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,951
I don't.

162
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,352
I know you think she's a good soldier.

163
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,908
Is she aware that I know about
her previous relationship with Scott?

164
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,474
No.

165
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,393
She's not over him, either,
but that's not an issue.

166
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,588
Thanks.

167
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,635
Sir...

168
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,317
There's something else I need to tell you.

169
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,673
Well, that sounds serious.

170
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,679
- I...
- RUSH: Colonel Young, come in.

171
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,189
Rush, go ahead.

172
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,394
Yeah, you're going to want to see this.

173
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,313
I'll be right there.
So, you were going to say?

174
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,437
It can wait.
It's more of a longer conversation.

175
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,789
Okay.

176
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,679
RUSH: When I was left behind on that
planet with the crashed alien ship...

177
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,829
I remember.

178
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,031
One of the things I saw there
appeared to be a map of this galaxy,

179
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,109
including the stargates.

180
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,792
- And?
- Well, Mr. Brody and myself

181
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,438
have been working on our own map,

182
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,751
based on our own records
of where Destiny has been thus far.

183
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,671
I thought Destiny had
a map of where it's been.

184
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,512
Yeah, but we're trying to
create a clearer picture

185
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,635
of the entire galaxy we're in...

186
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,472
Rush, just cut to the chase, will you?

187
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,073
I was hoping to have some better news,

188
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:36,188
but if I'm right,
then we are at the very edge of this galaxy.

189
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,113
Well, how is that bad news? We know
that Destiny travels between galaxies.

190
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:44,514
Yeah, but the space between galaxies
is huge. Vast, empty.

191
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,591
You think that's why
that power-saving protocol kicked in?

192
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,797
I don't know, it could be, but more
importantly, there will be no more gates.

193
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,680
No chance of dialing back to this system.

194
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,553
If we don't find them
the next time we drop out of FTL,

195
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,352
we won't have another chance.

196
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,758
ELI: Oh, my God.
SCOTT: What?

197
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,831
The Kino.

198
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,672
Look, look, an exit!

199
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,599
The Kino found an exit.

200
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,398
SCOTT: That's awesome. Where's the Kino?

201
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,357
- Oh, I have no idea.
- Right. Exactly.

202
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,392
Come on, at least now we know
that there is a way out of here.

203
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,036
Left or right? What's it going to be?

204
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,909
We're traveling blind,
so what difference does it make?

205
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,752
SCOTT: Left. I like left.

206
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,599
- No offense to what you like, man, but...
- No. He's right. We should go left.

207
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,759
How do you know for sure?

208
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,916
Because that's what this map says.

209
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,038
There's been a few of these along the way.

210
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,680
I thought they were
just decorative, at first.

211
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,631
So far they've all been the same,
except for one thing.

212
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,154
This symbol seems to be
in different places.

213
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,755
You are here.

214
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,354
There have been maps down here
this whole time?

215
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,112
That's awesome. Are you sure?

216
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,678
Well, this seems to be
the fork we're standing at.

217
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,194
Yeah, well,
there's only one way to find out.

218
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,154
What are you doing?

219
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,231
Going to go look for another one.

220
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,149
Greer!

221
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,429
Greer!

222
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,236
She's right. There's another map...

223
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,989
Greer!

224
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,909
JOHANSEN: I tried.

225
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,398
I did, really!

226
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,710
I was about to tell him,
and then he got called away by Rush.

227
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,313
Well, you should have told him anyway.

228
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,073
- It just... It sounded important.
- So is this.

229
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,754
- I know.
- He's going to find out soon enough.

230
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,679
I mean, you're starting to show.

231
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,349
I know.

232
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,838
Are you afraid of what he's going to say?

233
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,756
Or not say. I don't know.

234
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,109
Go tell him right now.

235
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,718
It just seems like
there's always something.

236
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,029
CHLOE: Matt!

237
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,349
I'm fine.

238
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,599
- ELI: Oh, my God.
- Greer!

239
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,557
Greer!

240
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,790
Come in, Greer!

241
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,113
Ron, can you hear me?

242
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,191
Maybe the signal
can't penetrate the rocks.

243
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,238
We could hear James pretty clearly.

244
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,354
YOUNG: Three hours.

245
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,591
RUSH: Besides dialing,
checking for safe environment,

246
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,035
roughly eight-to-10 minutes per planet.

247
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,954
Factor in time to get back,
we'll be able to see roughly 20 planets.

248
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,953
At least we know the direction to go in.

249
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,832
We'll find them, sir.

250
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,955
Good luck.

251
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,588
Colonel, it's T.J., come in.

252
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,113
Go ahead.

253
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,235
Have they left?

254
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,198
Yes. Unfortunately,
it's a very short window.

255
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,790
Do you have some time to talk in private?

256
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,792
I'm just on my way to see Dr. Volker,
talk about the charging plates,

257
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,314
putting them back online.
Nothing seems to be working around here.

258
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,989
Can it wait?

259
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,869
SCOTT: Greer!

260
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,393
Come on, buddy! Greer!

261
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,397
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

262
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,831
SCOTT: All right. All right, stop, stop!

263
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,319
Stop moving rocks.

264
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,028
We need to get out of here.

265
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,712
Look, I saw those rocks coming down...

266
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,832
I know he would want us
to get out of here alive,

267
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,070
especially if there was no hope for him.

268
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,754
Are you just saying that because you
think you need to get us out of here?

269
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,029
Gear up.

270
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,997
Give me a second here. Just go.

271
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,512
Look, Greer?

272
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,073
I'm sorry, man.

273
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,838
Go. Move, move, move, move, move.
This thing's coming down.

274
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,315
WOMAN: Please.
MAN: No.

275
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,630
WOMAN: The boy has to eat.
MAN: Look, don't you go near there.

276
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,476
WOMAN: You got to let him out.
MAN: I don't got to do nothing!

277
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,913
WOMAN: Oh, come on.

278
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,829
Mom?

279
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,598
MAN: The boy has to learn.

280
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,474
Hello!

281
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,833
Hey!

282
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,113
Hey, you guys, can anybody hear me?

283
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,159
I'm here!

284
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,278
Scott, this is Greer, come in.

285
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,269
Come in.

286
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,195
ELI: Hey, at least the tremors have stopped.

287
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,113
Probably got far enough from the cave-in.

288
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,434
I'll go.

289
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,869
Done.

290
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,869
Done.

291
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,158
WOMAN: He wasn't always like this.

292
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,474
You say that all the time.

293
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,949
He was a good man, a good father.

294
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,035
- You were too young to remember.
- I hate him.

295
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,869
It's not his fault.

296
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,029
Don't care.

297
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,629
You need to be strong.

298
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,869
I know you got it in you.

299
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,074
He needs us, both of us.

300
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,918
Nobody else is going to take care of him.

301
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,235
We need to go.

302
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,430
- Where?
- Far away.

303
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,431
Both of us. We need to get out of here.

304
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,794
Eli, hold up a second.

305
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,349
What?

306
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,115
I'm saying maybe the thing to do
is stay put.

307
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,760
If it is possible to connect the dots
between here and Destiny,

308
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,559
then Colonel Young is going to
send a team back to look for us.

309
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,517
Maybe we'd be better off
waiting for them to find us.

310
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,670
We don't know how long
Destiny is going to stop for.

311
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,998
If it's a short window,
there might not be enough time

312
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,753
for them to get here,
and then to gate back to Destiny?

313
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,554
We need to take the chance.

314
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,594
Okay, dial it.

315
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,708
ELI: It's hard to see.

316
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,510
Looks pretty foggy,

317
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,874
but everything else is good.

318
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,629
It's safe to go.

319
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,309
Yeah.

320
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,594
Get out.

321
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,429
Get out.

322
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,399
I don't have any money.

323
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,436
Probably a good thing down here.

324
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,433
MAN ON STREET: Just throw it
out the window!

325
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,676
MAN: Come back, baby, I'm sorry.

326
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,429
Matt?

327
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,196
All right, it'll take a minute
for the gate list to refresh.

328
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,874
If Destiny's in FTL, it won't show up, right?

329
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,555
Right.

330
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,949
So shouldn't we be spending
a little more time on these planets,

331
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,189
waiting to see if it does?

332
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,512
What if it is out of FTL,
but just one planet away from here?

333
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,352
See, I knew this was a bad idea.

334
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,596
Weren't you the one who said
we should stop being so negative?

335
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,353
Ten minutes. We give each planet...

336
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,239
SCOTT: You hear that?

337
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,389
Of course we heard it.

338
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,752
- Dial the gate.
- I'm dialing.

339
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,757
- Dial faster.
- I'm dialing, I'm dialing!

340
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,509
Eli!

341
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,789
- Holy...
- Go!

342
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,434
Mom! Mom!

343
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,916
Mom! Mom! Mom, we have to go!
Mom, wake up!

344
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,878
You should've let me burn.

345
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,113
JAMES: It's beautiful.

346
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,634
Not that I'd want to be stuck here
for a long time,

347
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,039
but it is an incredible sight to see.

348
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,789
Yes.

349
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,313
This is our 10th planet.

350
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,799
We have less than an hour and a half left.

351
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,394
This is a lot more complicated
than I'd anticipated.

352
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,151
Who would have guessed that
Destiny had skipped over

353
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,229
so many planets with gates on them?

354
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,992
Getting back should be
much quicker, though.

355
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,909
Yes.

356
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,274
Well, we have extra Kinos and a remote.

357
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,590
Maybe it's time we split up,
cover more planets.

358
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,669
Agreed.

359
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,279
We're going to find them.

360
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,509
We just need a bit of luck.

361
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,477
I'm afraid I don't believe in that.

362
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,070
So, you'll take one team
and I'll take the other?

363
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,629
MAN: The fires...

364
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,438
The fires were everywhere.

365
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,238
That oil burned hot.

366
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,675
Got so we forgot
what a clean breath of air felt like.

367
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,990
Emphysema, asthma, bronchitis.

368
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,117
They said none of the guys sent in
to put out the fire showed any ill-effects.

369
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,078
Come on, you buy that?
How can that be true?

370
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,309
Those fires were everywhere...

371
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,470
The man's a living hell.

372
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,673
Sent by the Devil himself
to torture me for all eternity.

373
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,389
Just a little skin reaction, they said.

374
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,072
Just a little itchy on the arm.

375
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,149
The FDA approved it

376
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,073
even though it'd never been through
any serious, large-scale trials.

377
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,517
There were no side-effects.

378
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,637
They said it was the war, not the vaccine.

379
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,676
Between 1998 and 2000,

380
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,116
20,000 soldiers had to be hospitalized
after receiving the vaccine,

381
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,350
even though
they had never been deployed overseas.

382
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,159
The Pentagon failed to report that
to Congress!

383
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,836
Wasn't as bad as the sand fleas, though.

384
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,797
They got under your skin, and how.

385
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,917
Carried all kinds of diseases.
Diseases you can't even say.

386
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,598
Tank busters. Uranium depleted.
I loaded those munitions.

387
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,230
Nothing dangerous coming off those.
What do you think?

388
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,756
18,000 times in two years
those alarms went off.

389
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,229
It's not the mustard gas,
never the mustard gas!

390
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,312
It was cigarettes.
Deodorant! Can you believe that?

391
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,029
Chronic fatigue, loss of muscle control,
headaches, dizziness, memory loss,

392
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,111
shortness of breath, brain cancer...

393
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,189
I'm going to kill him.

394
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,349
Put him out of his misery.

395
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,352
It was the war. It was the war!

396
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,795
It wasn't the fires. They were everywhere.

397
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,599
Big, black, billowing smoke.
The war is why he can't breathe.

398
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,040
Hey, T.J. Listen, I'm sorry.

399
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,109
One thing turned into another,

400
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,679
and the next thing you knew,
a five-minute update is...

401
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,034
I'm pregnant.

402
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,719
You're pregnant?

403
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,552
How far along are you?

404
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,958
About 22 weeks.

405
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,678
It's yours.

406
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,749
Ours.

407
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,716
A baby. On this ship.

408
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,348
I'm keeping it.

409
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,275
No, I didn't say you shouldn't.

410
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,358
What are you saying?

411
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,152
We're going to make this work.

412
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,310
That's what we're going to do,
we're going to make it work.

413
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,669
Okay?

414
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,311
- ELI: This is a problem.
- What?

415
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,475
The Kino says the atmosphere
on the planet we just sent it to is toxic.

416
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,149
We can't go through.

417
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,798
CHLOE: Which means we can't
get that Kino back.

418
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,474
And we won't know
if the next address we try is safe.

419
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,110
- Dial another one.
- But I just said that...

420
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,077
I know, I know, but we can't stay here,
can we?

421
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,071
- No, no, but I...
- You stay, I'll go, I'll go.

422
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,116
- I'll radio back if it's safe.
- CHLOE: Matt, no.

423
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,875
Look, we stay here, we're as good
as dead anyway. Dial another one.

424
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,519
They left you.

425
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,068
- Abandoned you.
- They did what they had to do.

426
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,592
- They thought I was dead.
- Nobody's going to save you.

427
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,913
Nobody cares.

428
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,951
In the end, all there is

429
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,274
is you.

430
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,759
You alone.

431
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,634
Doctor says there's an infection
in his brain.

432
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,192
They say
there's nothing they can do for him.

433
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,118
I enlisted.

434
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,998
What'd you go and do that for?

435
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,079
I didn't get the scholarship.

436
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,434
But you worked so hard.

437
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,078
Wasn't fast enough.

438
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,038
You always said it wasn't his fault.

439
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,230
His choice wasn't wrong.

440
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,550
He just wanted to be somebody.

441
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,835
I want to be somebody.

442
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,034
You don't have anything to prove
to anyone.

443
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,951
You didn't let him change you.

444
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,552
Nothing can hurt the spirit God gave you...

445
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,232
I have to use it.

446
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,674
Don't I?

447
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,318
To make a difference.

448
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,316
You can still change your mind.

449
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,239
I'm not going to.

450
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,159
All right, I'm okay. It's cold and dark,

451
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,199
but I can breathe,
and there's no crazy dinosaurs,

452
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,876
at least not yet. Come on through.

453
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,789
Whoa!

454
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,188
It's kind of pretty.

455
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,793
Sometimes we would spend Christmas
at a cabin in Vermont.

456
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,639
Amazing

457
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,397
that a planet
on the other side of the universe

458
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,708
can remind you of Vermont.

459
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,917
Okay, here we go,
the next set of addresses.

460
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,915
Oh, God.

461
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,869
What?

462
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,233
I recognize this one.

463
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,673
SCOTT: One we've been to before?

464
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,113
Not recently.

465
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,789
That's not good.

466
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,110
It's the one
with the downed alien ship that...

467
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,317
The planet Rush was stranded on.

468
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,793
We've been heading the wrong way.

469
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,232
Okay, so what now?

470
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,829
- Can we retrace our steps?
- Wait.

471
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,955
No...

472
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,519
We should go to this planet.

473
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,433
- Why?
- Look, even if we retrace our steps

474
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,478
and try this all again
with different choices,

475
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,675
we're traveling blind.

476
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,674
Rush said he was able to boot up
the computer on that alien ship.

477
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,113
Yeah, and that's what brought the aliens.

478
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,395
Yes, but in the small time
that he was there,

479
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,234
he was able to glean some information
about the shape of this galaxy

480
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,958
and where the stargates are.

481
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,988
If I can do the same,

482
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,558
we won't have to stumble around.

483
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,273
We'd have a map.

484
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,271
Okay, but what about the aliens?

485
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,279
Believe me, you do not want to end up
a prisoner on one of those ships.

486
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,272
ELI: I realize we might not have much time.

487
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,556
We'll have to get in and out quickly.

488
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,592
If they're not there now.

489
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,839
Lieutenant.

490
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,118
CHLOE: I hope this is a good idea.

491
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,599
All right, come on.

492
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,599
SCOTT: Hey, Eli?

493
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,148
How about this?

494
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,959
Guess we're in the right place.

495
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,952
SCOTT: Well, I didn't see any other
alien spaceships, did you?

496
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,076
- Come on, the clock is ticking.
- I know, I know.

497
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,909
Fifteen minutes.

498
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,428
Where'd you get that number?

499
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,953
I like it.

500
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,110
This is an alien spaceship.

501
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,599
Right, exactly. Fifteen minutes, that is it.
End of discussion.

502
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,234
Nice work, Lieutenant.

503
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,632
Thank you, sir.

504
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,994
Any word from Rush?

505
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,195
Not yet.

506
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,036
I'm glad you made it back.

507
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,599
Yes, sir.

508
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,469
Sergeant?

509
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,752
They thought I was dead.

510
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,275
I don't think
they would have left me otherwise.

511
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,035
I just hope that choice
doesn't mean we've lost them.

512
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,477
None of this makes any sense.

513
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,919
SCOTT: Okay, time's up.
We need to walk away.

514
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,399
Not yet.

515
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,469
Wait.

516
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,549
You just said

517
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,551
- none of this makes any sense, Eli.
- I know. I know.

518
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,389
Go back.

519
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,156
- What do you mean?
- The screens, go back.

520
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,674
CHLOE: There!

521
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,749
Select that.

522
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,875
ELI: There it is.

523
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,194
How did you know that?

524
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,474
I don't know.

525
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,838
Can you read this?

526
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,273
No, I just...

527
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,319
Know what it means?

528
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,956
Look, can you use this to get us back
to Destiny or not?

529
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,432
Yes?

530
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,556
Yes. I think so.

531
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,713
We have to hurry, though.

532
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,789
SCOTT: Why?

533
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,031
If I'm reading this right,
then Destiny is about to leave the galaxy.

534
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,712
If we don't get back on board
before it does,

535
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,557
we're going to be stranded for good.

536
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,629
Game over.

537
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,634
Five minutes.

538
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,758
Okay...

539
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,559
- Seriously, there was no quicker way?
- No.

540
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,359
If I'm right, this planet should be just...

541
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,032
There it is! Destiny!

542
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,678
- Dial, dial, dial, dial!
- Okay.

543
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,988
Down to the wire.

544
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,192
RILEY: Incoming wormhole.

545
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,351
- You cut it close.
- RUSH: Greer.

546
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,431
And the others are not with him.

547
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,438
- What happened?
- I don't know.

548
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,389
It didn't connect.

549
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,595
- CHLOE: Why not?
- I don't know!

550
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,509
So, where are they?

551
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,669
Dial it again.

552
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,238
- Dial it again!
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, okay.

553
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,918
- What happened?
- I said I don't...

554
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,348
Oh, God.

555
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,829
CHLOE: What?

556
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,434
The address just disappeared.

557
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,875
How can it be there one second
and then gone the next?

558
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,754
They jumped.

559
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,314
We missed it.

560
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,752
We must have just

561
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,593
missed it.

562
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,349
That's it.

563
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,869
We're done.

564
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,509
I'm trying to carry on for Eli.
Don't you think he'd want me to?

565
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,113
I mean, I think it's important.

566
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,076
Look, I know you've been through a lot.

567
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,559
I only need a minute or two.

568
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,438
What happened on the planet?

569
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,831
People are going to want
to hear your story, you know.

570
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,435
Maybe another time.
