00:04:02,182 --> 00:04:05,549
General O'Neill. l'm reporting to you
from onboard an Ancient spaceship

4
00:04:05,652 --> 00:04:08,621
-somewhere far beyond our known...
-Just slow down, back up.

00:04:08,755 --> 00:04:09,813
Who's with you?

6
00:04:10,523 --> 00:04:14,482
Several dozen, l'm not sure,
but the point is, l did it.

7
00:04:15,261 --> 00:04:18,389
l successfully made the connection
to the ninth chevron address.

8
00:04:18,498 --> 00:04:22,628
You were supposed to be
evacuating non-combat personnel.

9
00:04:22,736 --> 00:04:24,169

10

l overrode that decision.

-Did you, now?
-lf you'd let me explain, sir.

12
00:04:31,244 --> 00:04:34,304
Dialing Earth was not an option.

13
00:04:34,414 --> 00:04:37,975
The core of the planet P4X351
had become unstable,

14
00:04:38,084 --> 00:04:42,214
and if the resulting blast had transferred
through the wormhole to Earth,

15
00:04:42,355 --> 00:04:44,516
the effect would have been catastrophic.

16
00:04:44,657 --> 00:04:46,056
So let me get this straight.

17
00:04:46,826 --> 00:04:50,819
lnstead of dialing up any one
of a number of other planets in our galaxy,

18
00:04:51,498 --> 00:04:54,661
you took a bunch of unqualified people
halfway across the universe?

19
00:04:54,768 --> 00:04:59,967
l took what l thought was our last chance
to dial the ninth and final chevron.

20
00:05:00,073 --> 00:05:05,010
l was successful. At that point,
the gate couldn't be shut down again.

the Ancients used
to scrub CO2 from the air.

267
00:17:14,111 --> 00:17:17,080
So, now we have two big problems
relating to the life support.

268
00:17:17,215 --> 00:17:20,480
Our first priority must be to
seal off any of the leaks.

269
00:17:20,585 --> 00:17:24,043
lf we can manage that, then we can
maybe buy ourselves a day or so

270
00:17:24,155 --> 00:17:26,646

past their designed life.

Can you fix this?

l doubt this stuff can be cooked off.

280
00:18:01,926 --> 00:18:05,726
Perhaps if there were stores
of this substance in a clean form,

281

CO2 sequestration, calcium carbonate,

There's another door
on the back of the shuttle,

but there's no control.

316
00:20:20,838 --> 00:20:23,238
Then maybe we can close it off locally.

is obviously not 100% effective.

designed to compensate

from a damaged shuttle,

00:21:23,901 --> 00:21:25,459
Well, that explains the headache.

334
00:21:25,569 --> 00:21:27,036
You already had one.

335
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:29,028
They'll find a way.
That's what these people do.

336
00:21:29,173 --> 00:21:31,232
Well, most of these people
aren't even supposed to be here.

337
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:34,538
-How did the ship get damaged?
-We don't know.

338
00:21:34,678 --> 00:21:38,614
lt certainly looks like it's been through
a battle, at least the parts we can access.

339
00:21:38,716 --> 00:21:41,150
We're still cut off from most of the ship.
lt's huge.

340
00:21:41,251 --> 00:21:44,186
They tried jamming something into
the shuttle doorway to keep it open

341
00:21:44,321 --> 00:21:46,414
long enough to let
the person inside get out...

342
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:49,253
But it just opens again.

343
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:51,554
Some sort of safety mechanism,
like an elevator.

344
00:21:51,695 --> 00:21:53,026
Rush says he can't override it.

345
00:21:53,864 --> 00:21:55,331
How long do we have right now?

346
00:21:55,432 --> 00:21:56,592
As it stands...

347
00:21:56,734 --> 00:21:58,258
Rush says if we don't get it closed,
we've got...

348
00:21:58,402 --> 00:21:59,960
...just over an hour.

349
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,080
Bad air's better than no air.

350
00:22:14,384 --> 00:22:16,511
Guess a day's better than an hour.

351
00:22:18,455 --> 00:22:22,186
Someone's got to go in there
and close this door.

352
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,431
My head is pounding.

353
00:22:31,568 --> 00:22:35,436
Heartbeat has accelerated.
lt's getting harder and harder to breathe,

354
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:40,539
as our very lives
are being vented out into space.

355
00:22:40,644 --> 00:22:42,271
That is going to get old very fast.

356
00:22:42,412 --> 00:22:44,437
-This needs to be documented.
-No one's going to see that.

357
00:22:44,581 --> 00:22:45,912
How do you know?

358
00:22:48,318 --> 00:22:51,412
We made it here. Someone else could, too.

359
00:22:55,659 --> 00:22:59,595
lf we die, maybe this can help them
to find out what happened to us.

360
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,288
Yeah, well, we're not dead yet.

361
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,232
l'm starting to have slightly blurred...

362
00:23:08,338 --> 00:23:09,532
-Eli!
-What?

363
00:23:13,677 --> 00:23:15,474
So how are we going to decide who?

364
00:23:15,612 --> 00:23:17,512
RUSH: l assume we're not going
to get any volunteers.

365
00:23:19,516 --> 00:23:21,814
What's another day going to buy us?

366
00:23:21,952 --> 00:23:24,216
Time, to find a way to survive.

367
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,757
May l see the list?

368
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,625
JOHANSEN: l marked the names
of anyone injured.

369
00:23:33,931 --> 00:23:38,425
Right. We have to find out people's
skills, background, experience...

370
00:23:38,535 --> 00:23:41,402
Doesn't take any special skills
to die from asphyxiation!

371
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:44,599
Look. What l'm saying is,
it shouldn't be someone

372
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,642
with potentially valuable knowledge

373
00:23:46,777 --> 00:23:50,304
or abilities we might need
to help us survive beyond this.

374
00:23:50,447 --> 00:23:51,937
Are you really suggesting

375
00:23:52,049 --> 00:23:53,380
-what l think...
-Half the people on this ship

376
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:56,315
-already want to kill you.
-l don't care.

377
00:23:56,453 --> 00:23:59,752
You can't ask someone
to sacrifice themselves, period.

378
00:24:00,691 --> 00:24:04,024
Politicians ask military personnel
to sacrifice themselves

379
00:24:04,161 --> 00:24:06,629
for the good of others all the time.

380
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:09,290
lf someone doesn't go in there
and close that door,

381
00:24:09,399 --> 00:24:11,890
we're all going to die, period.

382
00:24:24,147 --> 00:24:27,378
Franklin is still working at
the airlock controls locally,

383
00:24:27,517 --> 00:24:29,508
but it doesn't look good, sir.

384
00:24:29,653 --> 00:24:32,451
Camile's explaining the situation
to everyone onboard.

385
00:24:32,556 --> 00:24:35,525
-l'll do it.
-Sir?

386
00:24:35,659 --> 00:24:39,151
This isn't the kind of thing l can ask
somebody else to volunteer for.

387
00:24:39,263 --> 00:24:41,891
lf we're going to make it past this,
we're going to need you, sir.

388
00:24:42,032 --> 00:24:45,001
l don't know about that. You're doing
a pretty good job without me, Lieutenant.

389
00:24:45,102 --> 00:24:46,660
Yeah? Well, look at the mess we're in.

390
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:50,467
-lf that's not proof that we need you, then...
-Look, l'm not sure anyone should do it.

391
00:24:50,574 --> 00:24:52,508
l don't want someone sacrificing
themselves for me.

392
00:24:52,609 --> 00:24:54,509
l say we figure this out together
while we still have time,

393
00:24:54,611 --> 00:24:57,045
-or we all die trying.
-l want you to both listen to me.

394
00:24:57,147 --> 00:24:59,479
lt needs to be done, and l'm doing it.

395
00:25:01,718 --> 00:25:04,084
-Look, sir, you can barely stand.
-Help me.

396
00:25:04,221 --> 00:25:06,052
Look, the paralysis is temporary.

397
00:25:06,189 --> 00:25:07,850
-Help me.
-You know that now. You will recover.

398
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:09,357
-Lieutenant, l need your help.
-No, sir.

399
00:25:09,459 --> 00:25:11,086
-l gave you an order.
-l know.

400
00:25:11,228 --> 00:25:12,991
You can have me court-martialed
when we get home,

401
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:15,758
but l am not going to help you kill yourself.

402
00:25:19,403 --> 00:25:21,268
My father's not in his room.

403
00:25:22,139 --> 00:25:24,767
We'll find him. He does not leave this room.

404
00:25:25,909 --> 00:25:28,605
-SCOTT: He can't have gotten far.
-l told him what was going on.

405
00:25:28,745 --> 00:25:34,581
Greer, this is Scott, come in. Greer?
Greer, do you read?

406
00:25:35,252 --> 00:25:38,415
Senator Armstrong is missing.
He may be headed your way.

407
00:25:38,722 --> 00:25:39,780
He's here.

408
00:25:42,225 --> 00:25:43,453
He's got a gun.

409
00:25:46,096 --> 00:25:50,362
l don't want to shoot you.
l don't think you want to shoot me.

410
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:54,627
-Get out of the way.
-FRANKLlN: Just give me a little more time.

411
00:25:54,771 --> 00:25:57,934
-Let me try and fix this.
-l don't have much.

412
00:26:12,956 --> 00:26:15,220
ELI:: Guys, I'm not seeing any change:
Whatever you just tried,

413
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:16,417
it's not working!

414
00:26:16,526 --> 00:26:18,721
The problem's obviously mechanical.

415
00:26:23,367 --> 00:26:24,595
You can't fix it.

416
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,307
Tell me what to do.

417
00:26:40,017 --> 00:26:41,211
Dad! No, wait!

418
00:26:52,562 --> 00:26:56,828
Dad, no! No! No! No!

419
00:27:00,003 --> 00:27:01,300
(MUFFLED ) Open the door!

420
00:27:01,605 --> 00:27:03,971
-Open the door, please!
-l can't!

421
00:27:04,074 --> 00:27:05,632
Please open the door!

422
00:27:05,742 --> 00:27:07,801
(CHLOE CRYlNG)

423
00:27:07,911 --> 00:27:11,312
-He was dead on his feet.
-Dad, no!

424
00:27:12,249 --> 00:27:13,477
(SOFTLY) l love you.

425
00:27:15,018 --> 00:27:17,646
(SOBBlNG) Please open the door. No!

426
00:27:19,689 --> 00:27:21,384
Eli! Not him !

427
00:27:21,525 --> 00:27:23,857
There's nothing l can do for him here.

428
00:27:24,728 --> 00:27:27,253
HeIp him! Open the door, pIease!

429
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:43,519
Please! No. No! No!
