Thank you, Lieutenant Rose Garden.

180
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,320
No, he's right. You're worse than he is.

181
00:26:26,423 --> 00:26:28,414
Wow, you can tell them apart?

182
00:26:30,226 --> 00:26:32,990
We also identified a recycling system
for liquid waste,

183
00:26:33,096 --> 00:26:35,758
so once we get that system
up and running...

184
00:26:38,902 --> 00:26:42,861
Okay, folks, let's have a better day
than yesterday. Thank you.

185
00:26:50,347 --> 00:26:52,577
-Your ration, sir.
-Thank you.

186
00:26:55,218 --> 00:26:57,743

188
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,515
Throughout the night, actually,

189
00:27:02,892 --> 00:27:05,554
trying to find out
why our power reserves are so low.

190
00:27:05,662 --> 00:27:07,186
l'm quite concerned, and so should you be.

191
00:27:07,297 --> 00:27:09,356
Okay, well, how bad is it?

192
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:14,429
l haven't been able to access any
of the main systems yet, so l don't know.

193
00:27:14,537 --> 00:27:16,528
You look exhausted.
Maybe you should take a break.

194
00:27:16,639 --> 00:27:17,731
Get the information we need

195
00:27:17,841 --> 00:27:19,741
and make some informed decisions,
and we report...

running around

they can get their hands on?

00:27:29,819 --> 00:27:31,047
l will.

That was delicious. Thank you very much.

Let's bring in the next group, please.

207

Just who you are
and something you want to say.

l'd like to say,

''Take your stinking paws off me,
you damn dirty ape! '' for example.

212

l'm not really gonna say that.
Just try it. Say something.

213

YOUNG: Well, it could be that Rush is
just starting a fire so he can put it out,

214
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,809
or it could be that he's so far ahead of us

215
00:28:59,909 --> 00:29:02,207
he can see problems
that none of us can see.

216
00:29:03,046 --> 00:29:04,570

you can hardly blame him.

220

l can blame him all day long.

221
00:29:13,323 --> 00:29:15,223

with Rush for now.

help translate the controls.

347
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:05,196
Look, he's just going to drag me right
back in here, and you know it.

348
00:36:05,301 --> 00:36:06,461
Come on.

349
00:36:06,569 --> 00:36:09,970
Right, l'm concerned that Destiny
is on the verge of losing power.

350
00:36:10,072 --> 00:36:11,437
Look for yourself.

351
00:36:13,576 --> 00:36:15,840
This ship's been flying around
for the better part of a million years.

352
00:36:15,945 --> 00:36:17,207
l know.

353
00:36:17,313 --> 00:36:19,406
So l don't understand why
all of a sudden...

354
00:36:19,515 --> 00:36:23,144
Well, we showed up and started
doing things, how about that?

355
00:36:23,252 --> 00:36:25,618
-Like what?
-Dialing back to Earth, for one!

356
00:36:25,721 --> 00:36:27,245
Come on, we had to try.

357
00:36:28,457 --> 00:36:31,858
Look out a window, man.
We're flying faster than the speed of light.

358
00:36:31,961 --> 00:36:33,485
How close to the end of the rope
can we be?

359
00:36:33,596 --> 00:36:36,531
You're obviously not capable
of seeing the signs.

360
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:42,364
Okay, well, speaking of signs,
when was the last time you slept?

361
00:36:42,471 --> 00:36:44,166
Look, if you know what you're looking for,

362
00:36:44,273 --> 00:36:46,605
there are clear indications that power
is being channeled

363
00:36:46,709 --> 00:36:47,801
into life support and away from...

364
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:48,968
How can you know that?

365
00:36:49,078 --> 00:36:50,943
We're still completely locked out
of the core systems.

366
00:36:51,047 --> 00:36:52,105
Out!

367
00:36:53,182 --> 00:36:54,979
-Okay, l'll... Forget l said anything.
-Now!

368
00:36:55,084 --> 00:36:57,518
-No, l'll just work quietly...
-lt's too bloody late for that, isn't it?

369
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:01,317
l told him you'd be a waste of time!
A waste of time that we can ill afford!

370
00:37:01,424 --> 00:37:03,585
lf you can't see the signs
staring you in the face,

371
00:37:03,693 --> 00:37:05,593
then you're no good to me! Get out!
