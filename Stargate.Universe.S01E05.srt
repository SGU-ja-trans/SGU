1
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:06,038
RUSH: Destiny.
The design is clearly Ancient.

2
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:08,369
Launched hundreds of thousands
of years ago.

3
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:09,669
SCOTT: Where the hell are we?

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,910
Several billion light years from home.

5
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:16,108
We are on a ship, but we have no idea
where we are in relation to Earth.

6
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:19,879
RUSH: This ship could be the most
important discovery mankind has made

7
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:21,317
since the stargate itself.

8
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,685
YOUNG: These are the wrong people
in the wrong place.

9
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,758
SCOTT: I've got a lot of wounded.
We need to get home.

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,623
RUSH: We barely have enough power
to operate the main systems.

11
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:31,925
This ship simply doesn't have
the capability to dial Earth.

12
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,262
Could you please stop people
running around

13
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,801
activating every bloody system
they can get their hands on?

14
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:37,870
I will.

15
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,400
Our reserves are gone.

16
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,070
All of our power is gone.

17
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,441
Our trajectory has changed.

18
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,412
YOUNG: What are you talking about, Rush?

19
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:51,977
Lieutenant,
what the hell's he talking about?

20
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,821
Ronald Greer.

21
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,357
I can't think of a better way to move on

22
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:10,058
from this world into the next,
or whatever comes,

23
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:15,603
than to fly into the most powerful thing
in all creation,

24
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:19,640
a star.

25
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,154
Out in a blaze of glory.

26
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:33,082
I like that.

27
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,021
That's beautiful.

28
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:10,460
- Everyone here?
- All here, sir.

29
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,722
If I could have your attention?

30
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,197
You've all heard about our situation.

31
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:20,972
It sucks.

32
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:25,903
I'm going to repeat the facts
so that we are all clear.

33
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:30,313
In just over a day,
this ship will fly into a star.

34
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,976
Now, we have no power
to change its course.

35
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:36,146
We have no idea how to steer the ship,
even if we did.

36
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,451
We are having another bad day.

37
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,990
So here's what we're gonna do.

38
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,358
We have a working shuttle.

39
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:48,593
We think there are three planets out there
that might be habitable.

40
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,067
Now, we think,

41
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,902
we believe that it's no coincidence

42
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,000
that Destiny dropped out of FTL
in this solar system,

43
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:59,305
to give us a chance.

44
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,871
Now, once we know for sure

45
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:05,547
that there is a planet out there for us,

46
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:08,987
- we are going to have a lottery.
- MAN: What?

47
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:11,818
We will draw the names of 15 people...

48
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:16,288
The shuttle can hold twice that many.

49
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,455
Not once it's been loaded up with supplies.

50
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:21,728
Besides, there's only
life support for 17, max.

51
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,665
You said 15.

52
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,103
I will be choosing
two of the people myself.

53
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:30,242
Two people with the necessary skills

54
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:33,835
to fly the shuttle
and survive on the planet.

55
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:35,642
Yeah, I bet I can guess who they are!

56
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,079
MAN 1: Yeah.
MAN 2: Yeah.

57
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:40,414
I'll be taking my name out of the lottery.

58
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,986
Anyone who wants to join me,
keep talking.

59
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,126
We're still several hours away
from knowing

60
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,755
if the first two are even habitable,

61
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:56,460
so I suggest you all go back
to your quarters and wait it out.

62
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,033
That's all I have for now.

63
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,350
What?

64
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:08,460
You should pick everyone
who goes on that shuttle.

65
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:14,097
It's the responsible thing to do.
And you should include yourself.

66
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,142
If they're going to survive,
they'll need leadership.

67
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:19,638
And an HR lady, I'm guessing.

68
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:24,874
I am not above that.
I would want you to consider me, yes.

69
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:30,955
I would want you to consider everyone
who could contribute to their survival.

70
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:37,886
I think you should do your job
and make the choices you need to make.

71
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:39,889
It wouldn't be very fair.

72
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,832
It would be more unfair
to send the wrong people...

73
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:45,267
We're all the wrong people!

74
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:48,067
These are the wrong people.

75
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:51,776
That's up to you.

76
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,877
Wow.

77
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,345
Okay.

78
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,848
Okay, who goes?

79
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:06,084
Other than you and me, I mean,
or haven't you given it much thought?

80
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:09,754
We can come up with a short list.

81
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:14,795
Factor in skills and strengths
to increase their chances of surviving.

82
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:16,931
Take age and sex into consideration...

83
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:19,436
How about just the people we like?

84
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,170
- That's not what I'm saying...
- You need to leave.

85
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,402
Handpicking just two of them
is a cop-out, and you know it.

86
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,740
- And by that I mean get out now...
- The responsible thing to do is...

87
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:29,406
...or I'm going to take your name
out of the lottery.

88
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:32,975
I may just anyway.

89
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:40,925
Please don't.

90
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,613
Eli! God, you didn't even set your alarm.

91
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,740
Eli!

92
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,675
I don't have time for this.

93
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,777
I thought you had an interview today.

94
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:12,084
They canceled. I was up all night.

95
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,751
Playing those stupid games.

96
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,294
They canceled, or you canceled?

97
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:19,796
Seriously, Mom, it's not my skill set.

98
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,491
Nothing is.

99
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,701
I'm late. We'll talk about it later.

100
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,856
Damn it.

101
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:09,036
I'm just hoping to find a planet,
grow some food.

102
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:13,318
Not that I know a damn thing
about farming.

103
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,413
You sound pretty sure we're both going.

104
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:17,819
Yeah.

105
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,148
Yeah, maybe I am.

106
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,758
Has he told you we're the two he's picked?

107
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,358
- No, it's just obvious.
- How?

108
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:32,101
There's only two qualified pilots
on this ship, me and the Colonel.

109
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:35,435
- He took himself out, so...
- Yeah, well, that explains you. Why me?

110
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,842
- Come on, Chloe, he has to pick you.
- Why?

111
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:43,006
You're the daughter of a U.S. senator.
He's probably been ordered to.

112
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:48,075
Being a senator's daughter isn't going to
help anyone survive on that planet.

113
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:53,655
And I think the Colonel's the kind of man
who makes his own decisions.

114
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,287
I'm not one of the two, Matt.

115
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,425
At least, I shouldn't be.

116
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,994
- I don't even know if I want to be.
- Don't say that.

117
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,331
There's still a chance
that I'll get chosen in the lottery,

118
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:14,844
but if I don't, I want you to know that

119
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:19,050
I have probably felt closer to you
in these past few days

120
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,142
than I have ever felt to anybody.

121
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,388
- So if this is goodbye...
- It's not.

122
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,117
It might be.

123
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,294
I'm glad he's going to pick you.

124
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,091
I want you there.

125
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,390
Yeah, well...

126
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:40,198
What are the odds? One in five, one in six?

127
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,208
Something like that.

128
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:49,942
Well, we'll see.

129
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,148
So how are you going
to get the thing off the ship?

130
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,725
With the remote,
when the shuttle takes off.

131
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,851
We might even get
one last look at the Destiny

132
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:06,557
from the outside
before it gets out of range. So...

133
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:13,304
- What are you guys doing here?
- We heard about your message in a bottle.

134
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:16,068
It started out as a documentary, actually.

135
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:19,507
Well, we want to be part of it.

136
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:20,738
Figured you'd be busy.

137
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:24,612
Eli, you realize the odds of anybody
finding a Kino out here...

138
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,810
Probably nil, I know. Let's do it anyway.

139
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:31,121
Let's do something.

140
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,758
Let's leave something of ourselves behind.

141
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,592
So who's first?

142
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:52,972
So, I... Okay. I'm Chloe Armstrong. I'm 23,

143
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,782
and I just want to say
that my father gave his life

144
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:02,581
so that all of us could survive another day,
and we did.

145
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:07,848
Another day.

146
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,600
Sorry, you radioed me?

147
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,825
Uh, yes, um...

148
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:22,404
The first planet is too cold.

149
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,072
Frozen methane.

150
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:26,940
The second is too hot.

151
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,604
The third,

152
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:31,808
well, that happens to be
behind the star at the moment.

153
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,511
Too far away to determine habitability.

154
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,247
When will we know?

155
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,517
It doesn't matter.
We don't have any choice.

156
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,822
We're gonna have to launch the shuttle
before we can get close enough.

157
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,927
The odds are good, though.

158
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,960
Its orbit is in between the other two.

159
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,697
The Goldilocks Zone, they call it.

160
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:58,038
- Not too hot and not too cold.
- Yes. Just right.

161
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:04,882
What if we used the engines from the
shuttle to push the Destiny off course?

162
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:08,745
That's a good thought,

163
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:11,948
but I'm afraid I've already run the numbers,

164
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:16,660
and without getting into delta-V,
into thrust-to-weight ratios, then...

165
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:19,287
- Not a chance.
- No.

166
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,657
Well, when do we launch the shuttle?

167
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:25,498
We could wait a few more hours,
but the extra time,

168
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:28,573
I don't think it's going to give us any
more information than we already have.

169
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:30,539
When the shuttle's loaded, then.

170
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,248
Colonel Young.

171
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:43,351
If, by chance, you were thinking
of choosing me as one of the two,

172
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,381
please don't.

173
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,084
Why?

174
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:51,795
This ship...

175
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:55,890
Coming here was my destiny.

176
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:00,228
My life's work was to be here,

177
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:04,742
not trying to survive on some rock

178
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,869
with a bunch of strangers.

179
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:12,111
In fact, you can take my name
off the lottery altogether.

180
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,383
Look, Rush, I realize
I should've listened to you sooner.

181
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:24,019
- No, no, I wasn't myself.
- Still, you were right.

182
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:28,332
It really wouldn't have made
any difference.

183
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,807
Do you mind if I ask you
who you are going to choose?

184
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,235
Lieutenants Scott and Johansen.

185
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:46,546
I would've thought Scott and Greer.
Yesterday's heroes.

186
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:50,281
- I've got my fingers crossed for Greer.
- Well, you could easily arrange that.

187
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:56,092
- You mean fix the lottery?
- Yes.

188
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,120
No.

189
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,723
There'll be those
who'll think you did anyway.

190
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,860
My name is Camile Wray.

191
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:33,227
My age is none of your business, Eli.

192
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:38,598
If, um...

193
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:44,832
If anyone finds this within the next,
I don't know, 40 years,

194
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,775
tell Sharon that

195
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,812
my last thoughts were of her.

196
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,418
The names of every person in this room

197
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:01,186
are written down
on one of these pieces of paper.

198
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:05,491
Dr. Rush and I
have chosen to exclude ourselves.

199
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:09,499
If anyone else feels the same way,
now would be the time to speak up.

200
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:17,404
If your name is chosen,
you are to go directly up these stairs

201
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:19,773
to the shuttle,
where you will be met by the two people

202
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:21,436
that I have already chosen.

203
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,911
YOUNG: Lieutenant Scott has pilot training,

204
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:30,785
and T.J.'s skills as a medic
will be essential on the planet.

205
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:35,155
If your name is not chosen,

206
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,895
you are to remain here
until I receive word the 15 are aboard

207
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,263
and the shuttle's rear hatch is secure.

208
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,030
Does anyone have anything to say?

209
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,894
Airman Becker.

210
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,897
Go.

211
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:24,165
David Walters.

212
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,879
Camile Wray.

213
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:47,957
Lieutenant James.

214
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,071
Dr. Park.

215
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,078
- Take a seat and strap in.
- Yes, sir.

216
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:39,981
Mr. Brody.

217
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,324
Sergeant Riley.

218
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,708
And Dr. Boone.

219
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,454
That's 15. We're done here.

220
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:20,181
- You can fit more people on that thing.
- Spencer, I need you to shut up.

221
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:23,455
Come on, people! If we don't do
something right now, we're done!

222
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,587
MAN: He's right, we gotta do something.
We gotta...

223
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:36,465
Now, I don't want to have to do that
to anybody else,

224
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,342
but I will.

225
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,450
That's it.

226
00:19:58,597 --> 00:19:59,962
Full count.

227
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:22,019
This is Scott. Everyone's aboard.

228
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,819
Rear hatch is secure.

229
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,120
Give yourself
a 60-second countdown, Lieutenant.

230
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:28,560
Some of us would like to see you off.

231
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:30,118
Some of us would like to see you off.

232
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,628
SCOTT: Copy that.

233
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:52,708
We're releasing the docking clamps.

234
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:29,519
The Kino's sending back pictures.

235
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,922
This is Scott. We're away.

236
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:38,054
You're looking good, Lieutenant.

237
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:39,721
I expect we'll be out of radio range

238
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:42,732
by the time we fire up the main drive,

239
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:48,200
- so we'll be thinking of you guys.
- You, too, brother.

240
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:50,664
You, too.

241
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,533
Matthew, T.J.,

242
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,041
take good care of those people.

243
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:14,997
There it is.

244
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:20,762
That's the Destiny?

245
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,053
Thank you, Eli.

246
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:44,992
I never thought I'd get the chance
to see the ship from the outside.

247
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:49,629
You know what?
I think I'm gonna go for a walk.

248
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:53,463
- How does that sound, Sergeant?
- Sounds like a plan, sir.

249
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:58,101
I shall be in my quarters for the duration.

250
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,840
I have 100 pages of a truly
mediocre book to finish.

251
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:18,858
Eli, I, uh...

252
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,121
I'm sorry I got you involved in this.

253
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:25,499
Actually, I'm not.

254
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,596
Yet.

255
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:32,376
I'll probably be sorry
at the end of the day, but...

256
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:38,749
We don't have that long, do we?

257
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:41,476
No.

258
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:45,779
How will it happen?

259
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:52,419
Well, there will be turbulence
from the solar wind,

260
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:56,827
far worse than what we've
previously experienced.

261
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,267
Heat, obviously,

262
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:02,297
and intense G-forces.

263
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:06,639
I suspect the ship will be torn apart
long before we reach the star.

264
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,950
Hopefully, it will be quick.

265
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:48,378
YOUNG: And while I don't condone
behavior of that kind

266
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,752
in any way, shape, or form, I gotta say,

267
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:55,349
the look on Telford's face
when you put him down was priceless.

268
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:57,888
Complete and total shock.

269
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,089
He was surprised, yes, sir.

270
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:03,757
I guess you can say
you even got away with it.

271
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:06,998
I'm just, uh...

272
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:10,872
Sorry that I...

273
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,138
That I disappointed you, sir.

274
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,775
You're a good man, Sergeant. I know that.

275
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,709
Besides, the bastard had it coming.

276
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:25,753
Yes, sir, he did.

277
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:31,857
So long.

278
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:35,131
At ease, Ronald.

279
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,707
ELI: Okay, Colonel,
just go whenever you're ready.

280
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:55,343
Yeah, no, no, I got it, I just, uh...
Can you just wait outside, Eli? Thanks.

281
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,152
Hi, Emily, I just, um...

282
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,461
I just wanted to say...

283
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,665
Well, you know. You know.

284
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:47,334
Where is everybody?

285
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,064
All the fun people are here.

286
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,706
ALL: Our Father, who art in heaven,

287
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:01,044
hallowed be thy name.

288
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,655
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,

289
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,251
on earth as it is in heaven.

290
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:12,957
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses,

291
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:16,693
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

292
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,133
And lead us not into temptation...

293
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,099
What?

294
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:34,706
Nothing, I just...
I realized it was past midnight.

295
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:38,175
Does that mean they've gone into the sun?

296
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:41,548
No. No, no, no. No, nothing like that.

297
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:47,124
It's his birthday. That's all he means.

298
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,691
Happy birthday.

299
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:57,895
Thanks.

300
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:00,999
Mr. Brody, would you
come up here for a second?

301
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:04,667
I need you to confirm
a spectrographic analysis for me.

302
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:14,316
Oxygen, nitrogen, liquid water.

303
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:18,246
Only trace levels of CO2.

304
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,618
What?

305
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:23,692
It means there won't be much vegetation.

306
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:27,458
Also means that the thermometer won't
be spending much time above zero, either.

307
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:30,056
But we can survive, right?

308
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,866
Yeah. It'll be great.

309
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:45,600
Yes!

310
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:50,571
Uh, what are we so happy about?

311
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:53,581
We're gonna live, Eli.

312
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:56,983
What about the turbulence
and the heat and the death?

313
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:59,522
No. All of that
would have happened by now.

314
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:02,218
- The shield is protecting us.
- But you said we were out of power.

315
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:04,227
I was absolutely certain of that,

316
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:08,129
and I have never been more pleased
to be wrong in all my life.

317
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,443
The lights just came back on in my room.

318
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:00,779
- What's going on?
- YOUNG: Stand by.

319
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,514
Colonel!

320
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:07,224
You're right! The systems are coming
back online all over the ship.

321
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:09,822
There's a rumor spreading we're still here.

322
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,259
We are.

323
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,387
Destiny needed all its power reserves

324
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:16,797
- to protect itself, and us...
- Uh, guys?

325
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:20,032
We're in the star.

326
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:24,673
That can't be right.
We're talking thousands of degrees.

327
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,939
RUSH: Well, we've just flown through
the corona, which is even hotter,

328
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:31,743
to say nothing of magnetic fields,
gravitational stresses.

329
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:35,285
This is what Destiny intended from
the moment it entered the star system.

330
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:37,251
You're telling me
it flew into the sun on purpose?

331
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:38,845
- Yes.
- Why?

332
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,720
To replenish its reserves.

333
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:44,218
- You're telling me this ship...
- This ship

334
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:46,559
is powered by the stars themselves.

335
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:49,064
Solar powered, quite literally.

336
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:51,727
There is no other explanation.

337
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:20,192
The engine just came back on.
We're pulling out of it!

338
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:25,098
The shuttle. We gotta call them back.

339
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:26,932
We haven't accessed communications yet.

340
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:28,062
I'm working on it.

341
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,799
Well, if you don't figure it out
before we go into FTL...

342
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:31,704
- Plenty of time.
- We can't strand those people here.

343
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:36,610
Well, this would be an excellent time
for you to trust me to solve this problem.

344
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:45,448
Okay, I'm gonna put us in a high orbit,

345
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:49,652
spend a little time looking around
for the best spot before we put down.

346
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:56,589
They're gone.

347
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,298
You know, I can't help but think
maybe they're the lucky ones.

348
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:03,533
- Don't, T.J.
- The planet is a rock.

349
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:05,131
I said stop it.

350
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:10,304
All right, here we go.

351
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:13,281
This is Young, come in.

352
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:18,813
BRODY: Right there, right there!

353
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:22,354
This, this is Scott. Sir, how the hell...

354
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,121
We're just as surprised
as you are, Lieutenant.

355
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,320
I'll explain later.

356
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,159
You need to get your ass
back aboard this ship.

357
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:34,965
Look, there it is!

358
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,564
Will do. Scott out! Everybody hear that?

359
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:39,402
Yes!

360
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:44,674
We have a visual of you, Destiny.
Plotting an intercept course now.

361
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:54,723
Uh, Colonel, stand by. Brody, come here.

362
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:58,185
- What is it?
- I don't know yet.

363
00:34:58,296 --> 00:34:59,991
Am I reading this right?

364
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,300
BRODY: You gotta be kidding me.

365
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:07,330
We're so close, you can almost touch it.
It's right there!

366
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,497
What's going on, Lieutenant?

367
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,599
The Destiny is accelerating away from us.

368
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:15,206
We can't match it.

369
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,740
- Colonel, we have a problem here.
- What is it?

370
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,575
We can see you, but the shuttle's
computer cannot come up with

371
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:25,781
an intercept solution.
Destiny is accelerating too fast.

372
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,620
I'm trying to put something in
manually here,

373
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:32,924
but there's no way to cross the "T, " sir.
We're gonna fall short.

374
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:39,325
- You're on full power, yes?
- I put the throttle up right away.

375
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:40,665
It's just not going to be enough.

376
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:43,001
ELI: You must have afterburners
or something...

377
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:45,632
It's not an F-16, Eli! It's a spaceship.

378
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,469
Is there anything we can do from this end?

379
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,980
Is there any way
to slow the Destiny down?

380
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:55,177
- That would do it.
- Negative.

381
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:03,624
Uh, we're out of ideas here.

382
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,228
Come on, guys.

383
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,227
Come on.

384
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:12,367
Lieutenant,

385
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:15,234
I want you to turn
and head directly towards the planet.

386
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,170
We'll send you the exact course
in a moment.

387
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:19,368
SCOTT: No, no, no, no, no.
The planet is a rock.

388
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:20,637
We'd rather take our chances trying...

389
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:24,146
Do what I'm saying, Lieutenant.
We don't have much time.

390
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:37,922
In order to reach the star,

391
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:40,995
Destiny used an aerobraking
maneuver to slow down.

392
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:44,626
I'm suggesting Lieutenant Scott
perform a slingshot maneuver

393
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,999
around the planet
to do exactly the opposite.

394
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:48,366
A gravity boost to speed up.

395
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:50,497
RUSH: It should put Destiny
directly in our path.

396
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:54,339
We're all aboard with that idea, Doctor.
Just give me the course and speed.

397
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:57,312
This planet's getting pretty big
in the windows here.

398
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:00,041
One moment.

399
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:05,945
I got it.

400
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:10,126
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Eli, there's many
variables here. Are you sure about this?

401
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:12,156
Math Boy.

402
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:16,499
- Send it.
- Okay, Math Boy.

403
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:21,104
- Sending the new course now.
- Is this going to work?

404
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:22,570
It's gonna be close.

405
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:31,915
Got it. All right, everybody, hang on again.

406
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:15,453
That's them.

407
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,929
Why am I watching this on TV?

408
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:25,696
Okay, we're only going to get
one shot at this.

409
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,634
Wish it wasn't the first time I tried it.

410
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,007
There they are.

411
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:36,944
You've got us lined up.

412
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:39,175
- You're doing fine.
- No, he isn't.

413
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:40,750
We're coming up on them too fast.

414
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:53,054
Lieutenant, our relative velocity
is too great.

415
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,826
Unless you can match our speed,
you're gonna crash into the ship.

416
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:57,760
This is all we've got.

417
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:02,005
- It's coming up pretty fast on us!
- I know, I know, I know.

418
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:04,700
- We have to come left!
- A little this way, Lieutenant.

419
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:06,868
What we need is more speed.

420
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:08,842
Fire maneuvering thrusters.

421
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:12,211
- That might just make the difference.
- Right.

422
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:30,155
Main engines off.

423
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,578
Uh, thrusters off.

424
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:44,045
Docking clamps engaged.

425
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:45,974
We're still in one piece!

426
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:50,017
Well done.

427
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:52,012
Well done.

428
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,921
We're on our way down.

429
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:16,739
YOUNG: You just said it was like an arm.
That's what you said.

430
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:18,314
But I'm dead serious about it. It was like...

431
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,544
That was the worst shuttle docking
I have ever seen in my life.

432
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:23,449
What are you talking about?
I barely even dented it!

433
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:25,021
The grinding noise!

434
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:28,558
At the very least,
there is a giant scrape along the bottom.

435
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:31,719
I'm gonna make you put on a space suit,
go out there, fix it right now.

436
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:32,818
Sergeant, we're gonna need some of that

437
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,160
high-temperature spaceship paint
for Scott here.

438
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,325
Yes, sir. I believe I've found some.

439
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,301
Dr. Rush, have a seat.

440
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:43,202
These two have even showered.

441
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:47,543
- No, thanks.
- Come on, we should celebrate.

442
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:50,637
Celebrate what?
That we're back where we started?

443
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:54,414
Come on, have a seat, Rush.

444
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:55,951
- Some other time.
- All right, well, Becker,

445
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:58,453
give him a double ration. He deserves it.

446
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:02,888
- Why's that, then?
- I'm in a good mood.

447
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:06,189
We're to be rewarded at your whim, then?

448
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,162
No, no... Just stop.

449
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:11,792
What, you want some reasons?
I'll... I'll give you three.

450
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,831
You were right about the power situation.

451
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:17,030
Not really.

452
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:20,474
You figured out the subspace
communications, how to call the shuttle.

453
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:23,275
We needed to get those supplies back.

454
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,371
You took your name out of the lottery.

455
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:28,943
So did you.

456
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:31,988
I was injured.
You actually made a sacrifice.

457
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:39,253
Unless you knew

458
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,863
that the Destiny was gonna
make it all along.

459
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:48,729
Cheers, everyone.

460
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:01,208
Let it go, sir.

461
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,349
He didn't know. I saw his face.

462
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:06,013
- There's no way.
- No.

463
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:07,613
What if he did?

464
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:14,059
He's right, sir. Let it go.

465
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:19,526
A lot of work.
