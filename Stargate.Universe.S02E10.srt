1
00:00:02,067 --> 00:00:05,525
<i>This is what Destiny intended from
the moment it entered the star system.</i>

2
00:00:05,603 --> 00:00:08,936
<i>That ship is the best chance
we have of getting home.</i>

3
00:00:09,007 --> 00:00:11,737
- Are we done?
- We'll never be done.

4
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,171
<i>You shouldn't have
left him on the planet.</i>

5
00:00:14,245 --> 00:00:15,769
<i>You think I don't know that?</i>

6
00:00:15,847 --> 00:00:19,578
<i>Everyone thinks we're safe.
They think that they'll never find us again.</i>

7
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:21,585
Why did you take
one of our people prisoner?

8
00:00:23,188 --> 00:00:24,655
<i>We're not safe, are we?</i>

9
00:00:24,723 --> 00:00:26,588
They're coming!
- Who's coming?

10
00:00:26,658 --> 00:00:28,285
<i>Lucian Alliance.
They're coming to take Destiny.</i>

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,590
<i>There's only one way
this is going to end if we wait.</i>

12
00:00:30,662 --> 00:00:31,959
<i>I'm not
surrendering this ship.</i>

13
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:36,626
<i>Once I've changed completely,
the Colonel will see me as a threat.</i>

14
00:00:36,701 --> 00:00:39,397
- Will it be you?
- I came to ask for your forgiveness.

15
00:00:39,471 --> 00:00:41,336
I forgive you, Ronald.

16
00:00:42,974 --> 00:00:44,168
That looks like our shuttle.

17
00:00:44,242 --> 00:00:46,870
<i>The shuttle was restored
to its original condition,</i>

18
00:00:46,945 --> 00:00:48,435
<i>better than it was before.</i>

19
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,475
<i>If they can send
our people back to us,</i>

20
00:00:50,548 --> 00:00:52,413
<i>don't you think it's possible
they can save our daughter?</i>

21
00:00:52,484 --> 00:00:53,678
I need to know.

22
00:00:53,752 --> 00:00:57,483
<i>I know that there were no
cabins, certainly no children.</i>

23
00:00:57,922 --> 00:01:01,881
<i>Simeon killed the man
guarding him, then he killed Ginn.</i>

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,594
<i>Don't you act like you are
the only person aboard this ship</i>

25
00:01:04,662 --> 00:01:06,152
that has lost someone that they care about.

26
00:01:14,973 --> 00:01:17,498
- Where's Eli?
- He hasn't shown yet.

27
00:01:18,743 --> 00:01:21,268
Eli, where are you?

28
00:01:22,547 --> 00:01:24,071
Eli, you're needed on the bridge.

29
00:01:37,395 --> 00:01:38,919
Thanks. I'm not sure what happened there.

30
00:01:38,997 --> 00:01:42,296
- I think I must've...
- Yeah, yeah, very interesting.

31
00:01:44,235 --> 00:01:46,100
Whoops.
Mr. Volker?

32
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:50,437
Sorry, I was running a diagnostic
on the ship's power distribution network,

33
00:01:50,508 --> 00:01:51,634
and I think...

34
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:53,904
Did you remember to bypass
the critical systems?

35
00:01:53,978 --> 00:01:56,639
Uh... No.

36
00:02:00,584 --> 00:02:02,017
There we go.

37
00:02:07,224 --> 00:02:08,987
This is interesting.

38
00:02:09,059 --> 00:02:12,119
<i>Looks like Destiny picked up
some sort of remote energy signature.</i>

39
00:02:12,196 --> 00:02:14,721
Mr. Brody, please don't make me
come over there.

40
00:02:17,968 --> 00:02:19,265
Why don't you be my guest?

41
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:28,902
So?

42
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,113
What do you mean, "distant"?

43
00:02:35,185 --> 00:02:36,743
We're on a spaceship
in the middle of nowhere.

44
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,186
From where I'm sitting,
everything is distant.

45
00:02:39,256 --> 00:02:41,986
This energy signature,
it's come from an area

46
00:02:42,059 --> 00:02:44,789
outside of the course mapped out for us
by the seed ships.

47
00:02:44,862 --> 00:02:46,727
Now, getting there would take
a bit of a detour.

48
00:02:46,797 --> 00:02:49,664
- How much of a detour?
- About a day's journey in FTL.

49
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:53,199
We have any guesses what it could be?

50
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:57,104
It could be potential new power source,
signs of intelligent life.

51
00:02:57,174 --> 00:02:59,267
Big black monolith orbiting a planet?

52
00:03:00,978 --> 00:03:03,242
- Sorry. Overslept.
- There's no way of telling,

53
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:05,076
which is precisely
why we should investigate.

54
00:03:05,182 --> 00:03:08,379
<i>Whoa, whoa! Whatever happened to,
"Destiny has a mission,"</i>

55
00:03:08,452 --> 00:03:10,181
and, "We're all on board
and moving forward"?

56
00:03:10,254 --> 00:03:11,687
This isn't forward. This is sideways.

57
00:03:11,755 --> 00:03:15,088
We haven't abandoned the mission,
Mr. Brody, merely delaying it.

58
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:19,653
But Lisa's right. This energy signature
could be indicative of intelligent life.

59
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,722
- Best case scenario, in my opinion.
- For real?

60
00:03:25,369 --> 00:03:26,734
Do I have to remind everyone

61
00:03:26,803 --> 00:03:29,169
what happened the last time
we encountered an alien life form?

62
00:03:30,107 --> 00:03:32,803
Or the time before that?
Or the time before that?

63
00:03:32,876 --> 00:03:35,743
Yeah, but you can't judge a neighborhood
by a bunch of bad neighbors.

64
00:03:35,812 --> 00:03:38,610
Are you kidding? That's exactly
how you judge a neighborhood.

65
00:03:38,682 --> 00:03:40,411
Look, it's possible that
whatever's out there

66
00:03:40,484 --> 00:03:43,920
<i>could be of great benefit to both,
ourselves and Destiny's mission.</i>

67
00:03:47,357 --> 00:03:50,349
- Okay, check it out.
- Let's plot a new course.

68
00:03:58,702 --> 00:04:00,431
How do you do that?

69
00:04:01,138 --> 00:04:05,472
Okay, let's get Chloe up here.
She can make the necessary calculations.

70
00:04:26,263 --> 00:04:30,461
- I tried radioing you.
- Sorry. Sorry, had my music on.

71
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:35,562
- We're about to drop out of FTL.
- Ah, okay. Thanks.

72
00:04:57,794 --> 00:05:01,059
Is that...
- Ships, or what's left of them.

73
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:05,467
That is one hell of a battlefield.

74
00:05:06,036 --> 00:05:09,836
Was a battlefield.
Now it's a graveyard.

75
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:27,181
So...

76
00:05:28,325 --> 00:05:32,022
<i>Uh, turns out the energy signature
Destiny locked onto</i>

77
00:05:32,095 --> 00:05:35,428
was the clustered radiation pockets
of the various ships.

78
00:05:35,499 --> 00:05:38,593
It looks like at least one of them
is familiar to us.

79
00:05:39,403 --> 00:05:43,533
That's the same type of ship you and
Dr. Rush explored a couple weeks back.

80
00:05:43,607 --> 00:05:46,507
Yeah, from the looks of things,
they came out the losers in this fight.

81
00:05:46,575 --> 00:05:48,873
<i>I'm having Destiny's computer
run a program</i>

82
00:05:48,944 --> 00:05:50,673
that'll plot back some of
these dispersion patterns.

83
00:05:50,746 --> 00:05:52,805
Hopefully then we'll get a better idea
of what's going on here.

84
00:05:52,882 --> 00:05:54,076
In the meantime?

85
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,447
In the meantime, Colonel,
we've come a long way.

86
00:05:55,518 --> 00:06:00,353
It seems a shame to leave empty-handed.
I suggest a bit of cautious exploration.

87
00:06:00,923 --> 00:06:03,517
Mr. Brody,
maybe you'd do the honors this time.

88
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:10,562
You know, it's like a space junkyard.

89
00:06:10,633 --> 00:06:15,570
Ships, hundreds of them,
scattered in pieces, far as the eye can see.

90
00:06:15,638 --> 00:06:18,732
It's... It's damn creepy.

91
00:06:21,043 --> 00:06:24,308
Anyway, I just thought I'd let you know
what's going on.

92
00:06:26,682 --> 00:06:29,981
- What's the matter?
- I already told you,

93
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,488
visiting me is a waste of time.

94
00:06:33,556 --> 00:06:35,581
I don't want you putting your life on hold

95
00:06:35,658 --> 00:06:38,149
just so you can come here
and watch me disappear.

96
00:06:39,395 --> 00:06:43,092
- Disappear? Chloe...
- It's spreading faster now.

97
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,094
I've tried to fight it,

98
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:53,606
control it, but it's stronger than me.

99
00:06:55,945 --> 00:06:58,038
Sooner or later, I'm going to stop being me

100
00:06:58,114 --> 00:07:00,981
and become something else,
something dangerous,

101
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,143
that won't be allowed to stay on the ship.

102
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:05,187
I won't let that happen.

103
00:07:05,821 --> 00:07:08,449
There's nothing you can do to stop it.

104
00:07:10,393 --> 00:07:13,260
The best we can do is make use of me
while I'm still me.

105
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:14,853
Will you stop talking like this?

106
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:19,492
- Why, Matt? Why deny the inevitable?
- Because it is not inevitable.

107
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:24,196
Of course it is, and
deep down, you know it.

108
00:07:26,842 --> 00:07:29,367
You've already started pulling away.

109
00:07:30,179 --> 00:07:33,444
When was the last time
we spent the night together?

110
00:07:38,888 --> 00:07:42,119
You see? You know it's true.

111
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:45,188
<i>Lieutenant Scott?</i>

112
00:07:47,596 --> 00:07:49,154
<i>Lieutenant Scott.</i>

113
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:52,093
Sir.

114
00:07:52,168 --> 00:07:54,159
<i>I need you to suit up
and meet us at the shuttle.</i>

115
00:07:55,704 --> 00:07:57,069
Right away.

116
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,275
This conversation isn't over.

117
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:32,431
- They need me on the bridge.
- Oh, Dr. Rush says he could spare you.

118
00:08:35,478 --> 00:08:37,105
- He did?
- Mmm-hmm.

119
00:08:39,882 --> 00:08:43,283
I'll save you the trouble.
I'm not crazy,

120
00:08:44,253 --> 00:08:47,279
which is pretty darn impressive,
all things considered.

121
00:08:47,356 --> 00:08:50,814
I went from living at home with my mom
to being stranded on a spaceship

122
00:08:50,893 --> 00:08:52,952
billions of light years from Earth.

123
00:08:53,028 --> 00:08:55,087
And screw the last starfighter,

124
00:08:55,164 --> 00:08:58,930
<i>because all those hours playing Halo
didn't prepare me for this.</i>

125
00:08:59,001 --> 00:09:00,935
No one was prepared for this.

126
00:09:01,971 --> 00:09:04,804
Everyone else had some sort of training,

127
00:09:05,841 --> 00:09:11,211
but, hey, I've come a long way
in my 10 months.

128
00:09:14,116 --> 00:09:19,053
I've fought space battles,
survived deadly radiation,

129
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:23,957
time-traveled, sort of.
I'm still trying to figure that one out.

130
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:29,229
I don't think you're crazy.
At least, no crazier than the rest of us.

131
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:31,492
Really?

132
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:33,791
Okay, then. Good chat.

133
00:09:33,868 --> 00:09:37,634
This isn't a psych eval, Eli.
This is just two friends talking.

134
00:09:39,007 --> 00:09:43,967
You have been a little distracted lately,
and that has some of us worried.

135
00:09:44,913 --> 00:09:48,314
You guys are worried
because I'm a little distracted?

136
00:09:48,816 --> 00:09:51,717
We're worried because,
given the recent events,

137
00:09:51,786 --> 00:09:55,847
you should be a hell of a lot more
than just a little distracted.

138
00:10:01,095 --> 00:10:04,656
The memorial video you put together
for Sergeant Riley,

139
00:10:05,533 --> 00:10:07,262
it was very moving.

140
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:11,836
You know what's weird?

141
00:10:13,675 --> 00:10:17,611
Sometimes, I'll forget that he's gone.

142
00:10:19,013 --> 00:10:22,540
I'll actually walk into the Gate Room
and turn my head,

143
00:10:22,617 --> 00:10:27,554
and then, for a split second,
I'll wonder where the hell he is,

144
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,453
and then I remember.

145
00:10:31,326 --> 00:10:34,261
He was a very important part
of your life here.

146
00:10:34,762 --> 00:10:40,826
When your whole world collapses down to
less than 100 people in a confined space,

147
00:10:41,135 --> 00:10:43,865
it all becomes important to you, Camile.

148
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,172
Riley was part of this
ship, and losing him,

149
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,345
it wasn't just... It wasn't just sad.
It was wrong.

150
00:10:54,115 --> 00:10:55,309
What about losing Ginn?

151
00:11:07,495 --> 00:11:10,896
So, when did you finish
fixing the third suit?

152
00:11:10,965 --> 00:11:12,933
Yesterday. It's perfectly safe.

153
00:11:13,001 --> 00:11:16,664
All right, wait, well, then,
how come I'm wearing it and you're not?

154
00:11:16,738 --> 00:11:19,571
Easier to fix
if something goes wrong.

155
00:11:20,108 --> 00:11:22,975
Which it won't, in all likelihood.

156
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,922
- All right, Colonel, we are good to go.
- All right. Take her out.

157
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,083
<i>Have a look around.</i>

158
00:11:44,098 --> 00:11:47,192
- Heading out.
- Lieutenant, be careful out there.

159
00:11:57,378 --> 00:11:58,572
This is amazing.

160
00:11:59,614 --> 00:12:02,515
I don't know.

161
00:12:03,217 --> 00:12:06,550
What, you're telling me you're not the
least bit weirded out flying through this?

162
00:12:06,621 --> 00:12:10,648
Nah. Anything that could hurt us
is long dead and gone, brother.

163
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,998
How goes it, Lieutenant?

164
00:12:29,844 --> 00:12:31,209
<i>Fine.</i>

165
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,146
We're coming up
on a target of opportunity here.

166
00:12:35,349 --> 00:12:38,079
<i>Yeah, we see it.
Looks more or less intact.</i>

167
00:12:38,152 --> 00:12:40,848
Picking up faint EM readings.

168
00:12:40,922 --> 00:12:43,982
<i>We've got an access point
on the ship's left side.</i>

169
00:12:44,058 --> 00:12:45,958
<i>Should we check it out?</i>

170
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:49,789
Sir?

171
00:12:55,069 --> 00:12:57,560
<i>- You're good to go, Lieutenant.
Yes, sir.</i>

172
00:12:58,072 --> 00:13:00,063
All right, let's do this.

173
00:13:01,843 --> 00:13:04,641
- Sorry I'm late!
- No, you're just in time.

174
00:13:07,315 --> 00:13:10,512
Engaging reverse thrusters.

175
00:13:20,327 --> 00:13:22,158
All right, this is as close
as we're going to get.

176
00:13:24,765 --> 00:13:26,528
Hats on, gentlemen.

177
00:14:01,368 --> 00:14:03,029
<i>Let's go explore.</i>

178
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,146
<i>I'll see you on the other side.</i>

179
00:14:35,869 --> 00:14:37,393
<i>I'm on board.</i>

180
00:15:07,267 --> 00:15:08,291
<i>I'm ready for you.</i>

181
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:20,603
<i>On my way.</i>

182
00:15:21,147 --> 00:15:22,774
<i>Come on, I've got you.</i>

183
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,055
<i>Mr. Brody's en route.</i>

184
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,473
<i>We're both on board.</i>

185
00:15:56,917 --> 00:15:59,317
Have a look around,
see if there's anything you can salvage.

186
00:16:01,922 --> 00:16:03,890
<i>Hey, this way.</i>

187
00:16:10,497 --> 00:16:13,261
<i>Hey, and, uh,
watch your asses over there, okay?</i>

188
00:16:16,469 --> 00:16:19,529
<i>Just do me a favor
and don't touch anything.</i>

189
00:16:19,606 --> 00:16:21,597
<i>If you see something
you want to investigate,</i>

190
00:16:21,675 --> 00:16:23,870
<i>just let me look at it first.</i>

191
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,944
<i>Wow, what did I just say?</i>

192
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,417
<i>Door panel's dead.</i>

193
00:16:32,852 --> 00:16:34,080
<i>Hold on.</i>

194
00:16:38,692 --> 00:16:39,818
<i>Here.</i>

195
00:16:43,563 --> 00:16:46,589
<i>That's it, just use the shoulder.</i>

196
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,499
<i>You might want to move up so
you can get a little more leverage.</i>

197
00:16:50,837 --> 00:16:53,032
<i>- Do you want to help?
- Okay.</i>

198
00:16:53,206 --> 00:16:56,698
<i>All right, then just shut up
and let me work, okay?</i>

199
00:16:56,776 --> 00:16:57,800
<i>Okay.</i>

200
00:17:02,749 --> 00:17:04,080
<i>Come on, come on, come on!</i>

201
00:17:30,042 --> 00:17:32,408
Hi, I brought you some lunch.

202
00:17:36,782 --> 00:17:40,377
Great. Sitting around in this room all day
really works up an appetite.

203
00:17:40,452 --> 00:17:43,546
Well, you can hardly blame the Colonel
for confining you to quarters

204
00:17:43,622 --> 00:17:45,214
after what happened with Simeon.

205
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,487
I understand, but you have to realize
that Simeon was unstable.

206
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,018
- And you knew, but you didn't tell us.
- I thought I could control him.

207
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,061
But you couldn't.

208
00:17:57,169 --> 00:17:58,397
I know.

209
00:18:00,939 --> 00:18:02,167
I haven't seen you in a while.

210
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:09,473
I wanted to come by. I've just been busy.

211
00:18:14,753 --> 00:18:18,245
Your people,
the ones who came back from the planet,

212
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:21,757
- they didn't have your child?
- No.

213
00:18:23,062 --> 00:18:26,395
I was wrong about that. I was misled.

214
00:18:28,267 --> 00:18:29,564
Possibly.

215
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:32,328
There's no other explanation for it.

216
00:18:32,838 --> 00:18:36,501
This ship has demonstrated the ability
to mess with people's minds.

217
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:41,804
In my case,
I guess it was trying to protect me.

218
00:18:47,619 --> 00:18:48,916
I should get back to the infirmary.

219
00:18:58,297 --> 00:19:01,198
- What is it?
- I'm not sure.

220
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:07,265
Talk to me.
What's your situation, Sergeant?

221
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:10,365
<i>Dark, and real quiet.</i>

222
00:19:16,882 --> 00:19:18,247
<i>Too quiet.</i>

223
00:19:28,594 --> 00:19:30,960
<i>Colonel, this is T.J.</i>

224
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,424
Go ahead.

225
00:19:32,498 --> 00:19:35,490
I've just seen some movement
in the debris field.

226
00:19:35,567 --> 00:19:36,727
What kind of movement?

227
00:19:37,402 --> 00:19:38,494
<i>To be honest, I'm not sure.</i>

228
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:41,334
It happened so fast,
I just thought I should report it.

229
00:19:41,406 --> 00:19:43,306
All right, thanks for that.

230
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:48,910
What the hell was that?

231
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:52,417
<i>It's Destiny letting us know
it finished assembling the simulation.</i>

232
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:54,577
Either that, or pie's done.

233
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,050
Nope, simulation.

234
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:05,126
Ready?

235
00:20:25,484 --> 00:20:28,351
- What are those leftover pieces?
- No idea.

236
00:20:33,492 --> 00:20:35,084
Oh, no. We got to get out of here.

237
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,424
- Why?
- Two sides battle.

238
00:20:37,496 --> 00:20:41,455
These guys, they're destroyed,
but these guys, they just go dark.

239
00:20:42,801 --> 00:20:46,168
They're not disabled or damaged.
They're dormant.

240
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:55,141
<i>Lieutenant, I need you to fall back
to the Destiny.</i>

241
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,342
<i>But Sergeant Greer and Brody
just boarded the wreck, sir.</i>

242
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,509
I need you to get them
out of there immediately.

243
00:21:00,585 --> 00:21:02,018
You may be in danger.

244
00:21:02,086 --> 00:21:04,247
<i>Yes, sir. Greer, did you get that?</i>

245
00:21:04,322 --> 00:21:05,516
<i>We're on our way.</i>

246
00:21:10,962 --> 00:21:12,486
<i>What in the hell?</i>

247
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:16,926
<i>- Come again, Lieutenant?
- I think I just saw something.</i>

248
00:21:17,001 --> 00:21:19,868
<i>What is it?
- I'm not sure.</i>

249
00:21:28,346 --> 00:21:31,645
Colonel, this is Camile.
We're not alone out here.

250
00:21:41,525 --> 00:21:43,823
<i>Sir, you have potential
hostiles en route!</i>

251
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:55,433
Shields to full. Ready weapons.
Fire only on my command.

252
00:21:58,009 --> 00:22:00,409
Eli, I want you to broadcast a message.

253
00:22:00,811 --> 00:22:02,176
In Ancient?

254
00:22:02,246 --> 00:22:04,237
Ancient, English, Bat Signal,
whatever else you've got.

255
00:22:04,315 --> 00:22:05,942
Tell them we are not a threat.

256
00:22:06,517 --> 00:22:09,953
<i>Greer, I need you
guys back here now!</i>

257
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:30,163
I've got to go.

258
00:22:30,675 --> 00:22:33,143
Tamara! Let me help.

259
00:22:39,283 --> 00:22:40,307
They're closing.

260
00:22:46,023 --> 00:22:48,287
Hey, we have more monitors.

261
00:23:00,971 --> 00:23:02,029
<i>Come on, come on!</i>

262
00:23:03,974 --> 00:23:05,202
<i>Go.</i>

263
00:23:10,047 --> 00:23:11,742
<i>Start her up!</i>

264
00:23:19,757 --> 00:23:21,918
- Shields are up.
- Any response from our message?

265
00:23:21,992 --> 00:23:23,016
None.

266
00:23:38,175 --> 00:23:39,836
- Move it! Let's go!
- Go!

267
00:23:40,811 --> 00:23:41,937
Return fire.

268
00:23:56,961 --> 00:24:00,192
We have a breach in one of the
unoccupied sections. I'm sealing it now.

269
00:24:03,534 --> 00:24:06,367
<i>Good to go?
We're good. We're good.</i>

270
00:24:06,437 --> 00:24:08,029
<i>All right.</i>

271
00:24:09,607 --> 00:24:11,234
<i>Okay, here we go!</i>

272
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,541
Shields are weakening.

273
00:24:16,781 --> 00:24:19,545
Transfer power from weapons.
- We have multiple overloads!

274
00:24:19,617 --> 00:24:21,710
Reroute, reroute!

275
00:24:24,488 --> 00:24:26,479
- We have to jump.
- The shuttle's not back yet.

276
00:24:26,557 --> 00:24:30,152
- We cannot afford to wait, Mr. Volker!
- We are not going anywhere!

277
00:24:36,801 --> 00:24:39,167
Let's go, let's go! This way!
Go, go, go!

278
00:24:39,236 --> 00:24:40,328
This way!

279
00:24:40,404 --> 00:24:42,167
<i>Keep your eyes open.</i>

280
00:24:49,245 --> 00:24:52,578
<i>- Two o'clock. Right there. See him?
- I see him, I see him!</i>

281
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,060
<i>All right, we are on board!</i>

282
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:10,899
All right, get us out of here.

283
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:14,702
- It's not working.
- FTL engines are offline.

284
00:25:14,771 --> 00:25:17,638
- They must have taken a hit.
- How long till we get them back?

285
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,966
Shields are weakening,
and we've got some weapons down.

286
00:25:21,044 --> 00:25:22,443
Several areas of the ship have gone dark.

287
00:25:22,512 --> 00:25:24,207
It's just a matter of time
before the shields fail.

288
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,680
All we have are sublight engines.
We'll never outrun them.

289
00:25:26,749 --> 00:25:28,649
We're going to have to try.

290
00:25:34,457 --> 00:25:36,482
A ship just dropped out of FTL.

291
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,991
It's a seed ship.

292
00:25:43,066 --> 00:25:45,694
<i>Destiny,
this is Telford.</i>

293
00:25:46,436 --> 00:25:47,630
David, how the hell...

294
00:25:47,704 --> 00:25:49,296
<i>No time for that now.
I need you to follow us.</i>

295
00:25:49,372 --> 00:25:51,533
- Where the hell are we going?
- It's on the move.

296
00:25:51,608 --> 00:25:54,236
- Where are they going?
- Directly towards the star.

297
00:25:56,613 --> 00:25:59,241
Let's follow them.
Divert all remaining power to the shields.

298
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:08,689
Here we go.

299
00:26:56,973 --> 00:26:58,998
We're coming through the other side.

300
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,084
That bought us some time,

301
00:27:18,161 --> 00:27:21,688
but we only have as long as it takes them
to get around the star.

302
00:27:22,899 --> 00:27:24,196
<i>Hey, you're welcome.</i>

303
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:26,899
<i>Let's dock.</i>

304
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:31,031
<i>I got a hell of a story to tell you,
and not much time to tell it.</i>

305
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,814
Gentlemen.

306
00:27:50,393 --> 00:27:52,327
This is pretty damn impressive.

307
00:27:52,395 --> 00:27:55,262
Not as impressive as flying a seed ship
to our rescue.

308
00:27:56,265 --> 00:27:58,631
Yeah, well, I had plenty of help
with that one.

309
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:02,203
The aliens we encountered
while exploring it,

310
00:28:02,772 --> 00:28:04,933
turns out they weren't hostile after all,

311
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,973
just desperate.

312
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,971
<i>After Destiny disconnected
and made the jump to FTL,</i>

313
00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:14,812
<i>I figured I was a goner.</i>

314
00:28:14,884 --> 00:28:16,909
<i>I was surrounded.
They had me at their mercy.</i>

315
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:19,386
But they ended up being friendly.

316
00:28:20,556 --> 00:28:24,083
I wouldn't go so far
as to call them friendly, but, uh,

317
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,061
they weren't exactly interested
in harming me either.

318
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:29,792
They were curious.

319
00:28:31,967 --> 00:28:34,026
I tried communicating with them,
but that was next to impossible.

320
00:28:34,102 --> 00:28:37,162
I mean, verbally, anyway,
so we found a shortcut.

321
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,466
<i>Their stasis pods are outfitted
with neural stimulators</i>

322
00:28:41,543 --> 00:28:43,534
<i>designed to keep
their occupants' brains active</i>

323
00:28:43,612 --> 00:28:47,013
<i>during extended hibernations,
so when they hooked me up...</i>

324
00:28:47,082 --> 00:28:49,277
<i>It's hard to describe
the experience.</i>

325
00:28:50,285 --> 00:28:53,049
It was like watching an entire film library
in less than a day.

326
00:28:54,356 --> 00:28:57,154
I saw images, thousands of them.

327
00:28:57,225 --> 00:29:00,683
Most were a blur, totally incomprehensible,
but others were clearer.

328
00:29:01,129 --> 00:29:03,757
And over time, the pieces drifted together,

329
00:29:03,832 --> 00:29:05,891
and I was able to form
a basic understanding

330
00:29:05,967 --> 00:29:07,127
of the aliens and their history.

331
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:12,368
<i>They call themselves the Ursini, and
after a while, they began to trust me.</i>

332
00:29:12,441 --> 00:29:16,878
<i>Eventually, working together, we
were able to bring the seed ship online.</i>

333
00:29:17,412 --> 00:29:19,243
Trying to chase you down ever since.

334
00:29:19,314 --> 00:29:23,774
You've been gone for almost a month.
What did you do for food and water?

335
00:29:23,852 --> 00:29:26,582
The pods provide basic nutrients
to their occupants.

336
00:29:26,988 --> 00:29:29,923
<i>I never thought I'd say this, but I
missed the food here on Destiny.</i>

337
00:29:29,991 --> 00:29:35,190
So, wait a minute, these aliens helped you
out of the goodness of their hearts?

338
00:29:35,464 --> 00:29:37,193
There's a little more to it than that.

339
00:29:39,267 --> 00:29:40,495
They need our help.

340
00:29:43,105 --> 00:29:46,472
The ships that came after us
are automated attack drones.

341
00:29:46,908 --> 00:29:51,607
Apparently, years ago, Telford's aliens,
the Ursini,

342
00:29:52,214 --> 00:29:54,011
made the same mistake that we did
and woke them up,

343
00:29:54,082 --> 00:29:56,482
and they've been fighting them ever since.

344
00:29:56,551 --> 00:30:00,180
When they discovered the seed ship,
they boarded it for...

345
00:30:00,255 --> 00:30:01,847
For long-term reconnaissance,

346
00:30:01,923 --> 00:30:05,518
hoping it would give them an edge
in their war against the drones.

347
00:30:06,261 --> 00:30:09,128
Their stay onboard
was supposed to be temporary,

348
00:30:09,197 --> 00:30:11,631
but no one ever went back for them.

349
00:30:12,167 --> 00:30:15,136
They were in stasis for who knows how long
before we came around.

350
00:30:19,007 --> 00:30:21,874
<i>They drained the power away from
Destiny because they were desperate,</i>

351
00:30:22,511 --> 00:30:24,945
just looking for a way home,

352
00:30:25,013 --> 00:30:27,345
and now, even though
they finally have a way back,

353
00:30:27,415 --> 00:30:32,876
they're afraid to make contact until
they're sure that the drone threat is over,

354
00:30:33,688 --> 00:30:35,815
which is where we come in.

355
00:30:35,891 --> 00:30:37,654
We can't trust them.

356
00:30:40,262 --> 00:30:44,858
Our FTL drives are offline.
We really don't have much of a choice.

357
00:30:47,202 --> 00:30:49,261
So what are we going to do, then?

358
00:30:50,672 --> 00:30:53,266
That's... That's still being discussed.

359
00:30:53,341 --> 00:30:55,070
You know, it's only a matter of time

360
00:30:55,143 --> 00:30:57,543
before the drones circumvent that star
and find us,

361
00:30:57,612 --> 00:31:00,877
and with the FTL engines still offline,
we're sitting ducks.

362
00:31:00,949 --> 00:31:05,215
Maybe not. Maybe there's a way out of this.
We help the Ursini defeat the drones.

363
00:31:05,287 --> 00:31:08,188
We barely survived our first encounter
with those things.

364
00:31:08,256 --> 00:31:10,918
That's just because we were
going about it the wrong way.

365
00:31:10,992 --> 00:31:14,257
According to Telford, the drones
are controlled by a command ship.

366
00:31:14,329 --> 00:31:17,628
Now, we take out that command ship,
we cripple the drones.

367
00:31:17,699 --> 00:31:20,224
- Simple as that.
- I doubt it'll be simple.

368
00:31:20,302 --> 00:31:22,327
I'm hoping for a step up from impossible.

369
00:31:22,404 --> 00:31:26,397
Do we know where
this command ship is located?

370
00:31:26,474 --> 00:31:30,069
They do. It's out of sublight range.
We would have to make the jump.

371
00:31:30,145 --> 00:31:33,137
And have you explained that our jumping
capabilities have been compromised?

372
00:31:33,215 --> 00:31:35,206
Telford has made them
aware of the situation.

373
00:31:35,283 --> 00:31:36,750
They've offered to give us a lift.

374
00:31:37,285 --> 00:31:38,912
I don't understand.

375
00:31:38,987 --> 00:31:41,478
They engage their FTL drives
while we're docked,

376
00:31:41,556 --> 00:31:42,716
and we jump with them.

377
00:31:42,824 --> 00:31:44,951
- That's possible?
- Theoretically, yes.

378
00:31:45,493 --> 00:31:47,222
Hmm. "Theoretically."

379
00:31:47,629 --> 00:31:51,656
There's always a risk when you attempt
a jump so soon after a drop-out,

380
00:31:51,733 --> 00:31:53,963
- but assuming it works...
- Hmm.

381
00:31:54,035 --> 00:31:56,367
First they take us someplace safe,

382
00:31:56,438 --> 00:31:59,134
then we play for time,
delay them long enough

383
00:31:59,207 --> 00:32:01,732
till we can get our own FTL engines
back online.

384
00:32:02,677 --> 00:32:04,440
- Double-cross them, you mean.
- Yeah.

385
00:32:04,512 --> 00:32:08,471
No, we can't do that.
If they have offered to help us...

386
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:12,213
It's a fantastic opportunity
to take advantage of their generosity, yes.

387
00:32:12,287 --> 00:32:13,879
That's not a good idea.

388
00:32:13,955 --> 00:32:17,391
Why not? I mean, at that point,
they're in no position to harm us.

389
00:32:17,459 --> 00:32:21,792
No, but in case you've forgotten, they
still hold the key to us dialing Earth.

390
00:32:28,869 --> 00:32:30,860
Where are Park and Brody?

391
00:32:31,305 --> 00:32:34,638
Effecting repairs
on some of the damaged systems.

392
00:32:41,315 --> 00:32:43,180
And what are you doing?

393
00:32:44,418 --> 00:32:46,545
Monitoring the ship's power levels.

394
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,712
Yeah?

395
00:32:49,423 --> 00:32:51,721
It might interest you to know
that you're bleeding energy

396
00:32:51,792 --> 00:32:53,316
from one of the weapons platforms.

397
00:32:55,496 --> 00:32:56,656
Shoot.

398
00:32:59,967 --> 00:33:01,127
Here.

399
00:33:10,044 --> 00:33:11,671
Go and help Park and Brody.

400
00:33:12,413 --> 00:33:14,881
- I'm in the middle of the...
- Go.

401
00:33:16,784 --> 00:33:19,412
Maybe I'll go help Park and Brody.

402
00:33:20,955 --> 00:33:22,752
I know. I screwed up.

403
00:33:24,091 --> 00:33:28,619
No. It's a minor oversight,
one of many, as of late,

404
00:33:28,929 --> 00:33:32,365
but you haven't screwed up.
Not yet, anyway.

405
00:33:33,801 --> 00:33:36,292
I'm sure with your present attitude,
it's only a matter of time.

406
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:38,361
Yeah, you know, I get it.

407
00:33:38,806 --> 00:33:42,537
People are depending on the boy genius.
I can't let them down.

408
00:33:42,609 --> 00:33:44,099
And yet, despite all that genius,

409
00:33:44,178 --> 00:33:46,112
you couldn't save the life
of the woman you loved.

410
00:33:53,053 --> 00:33:54,077
What?

411
00:33:54,154 --> 00:33:56,554
Someone bigger and stronger came along,
took her away from you,

412
00:33:56,623 --> 00:33:58,215
and there wasn't a thing
you could do about it.

413
00:33:59,994 --> 00:34:04,363
I'm sure you were so blinded by rage
you even imagined getting revenge

414
00:34:04,431 --> 00:34:08,367
on the guy that killed her,
beating the bully at his own game.

415
00:34:09,236 --> 00:34:12,694
Even if you had,
it wouldn't have changed a damn thing.

416
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:17,106
You'd still be getting up in the morning,
she'd still be dead.

417
00:34:19,913 --> 00:34:21,505
I'm out of here.

418
00:34:22,349 --> 00:34:25,944
You know, we grew up taught to believe
that everyone's equal,

419
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,818
that you're no better than anyone else.

420
00:34:28,922 --> 00:34:31,322
Of course, that's a lie.

421
00:34:32,092 --> 00:34:33,753
Some are better than others,

422
00:34:33,827 --> 00:34:37,228
and it's those who recognize
what makes them better,

423
00:34:37,297 --> 00:34:39,993
and learn to exploit that, who succeed.

424
00:34:43,904 --> 00:34:46,372
You've got so much potential, Eli.

425
00:34:46,774 --> 00:34:50,369
You're capable of success
beyond your wildest dreams,

426
00:34:50,444 --> 00:34:53,470
but the only way that you can achieve that,

427
00:34:53,547 --> 00:34:56,243
you've got to make sure
you don't get beaten down.

428
00:34:57,584 --> 00:35:00,678
You can't give up, not now you're so close.

429
00:35:02,956 --> 00:35:05,447
Am I interrupting something?

430
00:35:06,427 --> 00:35:10,523
Telford communicated with the Ursini
and is on his way back from the seed ship.

431
00:35:10,597 --> 00:35:12,758
Looks like we got ourselves a deal.

432
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:25,105
All right, let's let them know we're ready.

433
00:35:27,781 --> 00:35:30,682
So this should work, in principle.

434
00:35:31,118 --> 00:35:33,951
<i>It's really no different than when the
shuttle jumps in FTL with Destiny.</i>

435
00:35:34,021 --> 00:35:36,387
<i>Except that the shuttle
is massively smaller than Destiny,</i>

436
00:35:36,457 --> 00:35:39,551
and designed to do that, while we're
three times the size of the seed ship

437
00:35:39,626 --> 00:35:40,718
and just hoping for the best.

438
00:35:40,794 --> 00:35:42,557
There's also the fact
that we're attempting to jump

439
00:35:42,629 --> 00:35:43,994
in the three-hour danger window.

440
00:35:45,332 --> 00:35:48,358
But what's the worst that can happen?
It doesn't work.

441
00:35:48,435 --> 00:35:50,266
Hell, no.

442
00:35:50,337 --> 00:35:52,635
It actually does work,
and at some point we detach,

443
00:35:52,706 --> 00:35:55,504
and the ship's million-year-old
structural integrity gives,

444
00:35:55,576 --> 00:35:58,875
and we end up vaporized.
That's the worst that can happen.

445
00:35:59,947 --> 00:36:01,278
Are you guys done?

446
00:36:04,618 --> 00:36:06,278
Less than a minute before we jump.

447
00:36:06,986 --> 00:36:09,181
Here we go.

448
00:36:10,089 --> 00:36:13,320
We are about to attempt
the coupled jump into FTL.

449
00:36:13,793 --> 00:36:17,991
<i>In approximately four hours,
we will drop out to a safer area.</i>

450
00:36:19,165 --> 00:36:23,864
<i>Once there, we'll have time
to effect any necessary repairs</i>

451
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:27,030
<i>before launching the attack
on the command ship.</i>

452
00:36:29,609 --> 00:36:31,634
Counting down from three,

453
00:36:32,945 --> 00:36:34,003
two,

454
00:36:35,214 --> 00:36:36,272
one.

455
00:36:42,855 --> 00:36:45,346
It's working. We're in FTL.

456
00:36:45,925 --> 00:36:47,449
And we're still in one piece.

457
00:36:47,527 --> 00:36:50,223
- How we doing?
- Shields are strong and holding.

458
00:36:50,296 --> 00:36:51,763
Structural integrity sound.

459
00:36:58,571 --> 00:37:00,732
Did they tell you? We made a deal.

460
00:37:00,806 --> 00:37:05,004
Once we've defeated the command ship,
the aliens are going to help us dial Earth.

461
00:37:08,814 --> 00:37:10,008
Chloe?

462
00:37:12,585 --> 00:37:14,052
Are you okay?

463
00:37:19,692 --> 00:37:22,058
We dropped out of FTL.
Already?

464
00:37:22,128 --> 00:37:23,993
Maybe there's a problem.

465
00:37:24,664 --> 00:37:26,325
Contact the seed ship.

466
00:37:27,733 --> 00:37:29,598
Oh, no.
What is that?

467
00:37:30,303 --> 00:37:32,498
I'm guessing that's their command ship.

468
00:37:32,705 --> 00:37:35,936
- We've been tricked.
- So much for our deal with the Ursini.

469
00:37:38,744 --> 00:37:41,713
- We just got a message from the seed ship.
What does it say?

470
00:37:42,215 --> 00:37:43,580
"Target the command vessel."

471
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:54,251
Damn it.

472
00:37:56,028 --> 00:37:57,325
Colonel?

473
00:37:58,798 --> 00:38:00,698
Let's engage the enemy.

474
00:38:16,849 --> 00:38:19,750
I've got to get back to the bridge.

475
00:38:20,553 --> 00:38:21,884
Let me help.

476
00:38:25,691 --> 00:38:28,455
- Whoa, where are you taking her?
- To the bridge.

477
00:38:28,527 --> 00:38:29,551
I have to check with the Colonel.

478
00:38:42,675 --> 00:38:44,836
Over here! Get in there!
Run!

479
00:38:49,382 --> 00:38:50,542
Shields are holding!

480
00:38:50,616 --> 00:38:53,210
<i>The drones have positioned themselves between
Destiny and the command ship.</i>

481
00:38:53,286 --> 00:38:55,686
<i>- We're not getting anywhere near it.
- Captain, this is Eli.</i>

482
00:38:55,755 --> 00:38:58,121
Chloe escaped her quarters.

483
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:01,125
- Where the hell did she go?
- I have no idea!

484
00:39:01,193 --> 00:39:03,286
<i>But she might be dangerous.</i>

485
00:39:03,796 --> 00:39:05,491
Brody, seal off that section.

486
00:39:13,306 --> 00:39:16,002
- Lieutenant Scott?
- We'll find her, sir.

487
00:39:28,054 --> 00:39:29,715
- What the hell happened?
- Change of plans.

488
00:39:29,789 --> 00:39:32,656
I guess your friends suspected
a double-cross and decided to act first.

489
00:40:25,977 --> 00:40:28,844
This is Lieutenant Scott.
Chloe has broken containment.

490
00:40:36,054 --> 00:40:38,522
Shields are starting to weaken!

491
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:40,717
Let's get a message to the seed ship.

492
00:40:40,792 --> 00:40:43,556
Tell them we need to make
a strategic retreat.

493
00:40:43,628 --> 00:40:46,461
We'll regroup, take another
run at this later.

494
00:40:47,065 --> 00:40:50,057
- Glad you could make it. Where's Rush?
- No clue.

495
00:40:50,301 --> 00:40:52,326
- How we doing?
- There's just too many of them.

496
00:40:57,642 --> 00:41:00,440
You said you wanted to help me?
Here's your chance.

497
00:41:04,115 --> 00:41:06,481
Put one under... Under like this.

498
00:41:24,002 --> 00:41:26,129
Chloe? Chloe!

499
00:41:28,173 --> 00:41:29,470
Step away from that console.

500
00:41:31,876 --> 00:41:34,401
- Chloe!
- It's too late.

501
00:41:36,247 --> 00:41:38,943
What did you do?

502
00:41:39,017 --> 00:41:40,882
Chloe, what did you do?
