1
00:00:03,136 --> 00:00:05,798
RUSH: Destiny.
The design is clearly Ancient.

2
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:08,371
Launched hundreds of thousands
of years ago.

3
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:09,737
SCOTT: Where the hell are we?

4
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:12,036
Several billion light years from home.

5
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:16,081
We are on a ship, but we have no idea
where we are in relation to Earth.

6
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:19,982
RUSH: This ship could be the most
important discovery mankind has made

7
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:21,246
since the stargate itself.

8
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,686
YOUNG: These are the wrong people
in the wrong place.

9
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,758
SCOTT: I've got a lot of wounded.
We need to get home.

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,521
RUSH: We barely have enough power
to operate the main systems.

11
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:32,064
This ship simply doesn't have
the capability to dial Earth.

12
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:34,161
Looks like we entered the Hoth system.

13
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:35,632
Minus 47 degrees Celsius.

14
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:37,498
GREER: Ooh! Nasty planet.

15
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:38,764
How are we going to cut the ice?

16
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,897
Plasma cutter.
Should cut through the ice like butter.

17
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:42,065
It's Dr. Rush. What's your status?

18
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:43,540
YOUNG: We got pure ice.

19
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:47,204
We should be able to break it up
into manageable pieces and haul it back.

20
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,987
SCOTT: Secure the perimeter.

21
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,887
Welcome to the jungle.

22
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:08,358
Okay, let's get to work!

23
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:12,999
So, your first alien planet.

24
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,166
Everything you expected? More? Less?

25
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:19,736
We saw what it was gonna be like
on the Kino.

26
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:21,307
True.

27
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,542
But it is nice to get off the ship,
get some fresh air.

28
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,249
Even if it is a bit sticky.

29
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,488
So you're not nervous at all?

30
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:35,289
Afraid some giant alien insect
is going to come out and bite you?

31
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,089
Sorry. I'm sure it's perfectly safe.

32
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,629
Everyone has to pitch in
and do their share.

33
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:46,000
SCOTT: Including you, Eli.

34
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,670
What? I need a break.

35
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:58,475
So hot.

36
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,446
All you're doing is standing there.

37
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:03,749
Making sure nothing crawls up your ass.

38
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,688
And I appreciate that.

39
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,456
CHLOE: Stop it.

40
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:20,230
- ELI: So, how's it going?
- Good.

41
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:24,307
- ELI: Digging?
- Yep.

42
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:28,880
ELI: You doing okay? In general?

43
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,745
I'm fine.

44
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,447
ELI: Good. Good. That's excellent.

45
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,324
- What's so funny?
- Oh, nothing.

46
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:48,162
No, no, seriously.

47
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,065
You're laughing pretty hard.

48
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,601
Come on, tell me.

49
00:02:56,409 --> 00:03:00,812
Why won't you tell me?
It's about me, isn't it?

50
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:03,139
T.J.

51
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:07,242
CHLOE: How are we supposed to know
what's safe to eat?

52
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,014
JOHANSEN: We can't know for sure.

53
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:12,686
ELI: What's that saying? A starving man...

54
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,463
Well, maybe it wasn't ripe.

55
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,572
- Try it.
- Oh, no. No, thanks.

56
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,733
You just exposed yourself now.

57
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:31,332
- Come on, seriously?
- Yeah.

58
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:34,379
If you had a reaction,
we wouldn't know which one caused it.

59
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,277
Volker just puked.

60
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,882
Have you eaten anything here?

61
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:44,317
- Eli!
- ELI: Mmm? Oh, sorry. Sorry.

62
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,761
Are you staying hydrated?

63
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,386
Okay, what about any numbness,
or how's your vision?

64
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:55,490
No, it's... My head's pounding,
and my neck's a little...

65
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:56,967
Oh!

66
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,167
We should get him back to the ship.
Eli, dial back.

67
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,302
SCOTT: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...

68
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:17,420
I don't know, I just started feeling dizzy.
It came on pretty fast.

69
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,990
It feels like you're running a temperature.

70
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,651
I thought it was just the heat.

71
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,594
JOHANSEN: Is your neck bothering you?
CHLOE: Yeah, it just started.

72
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:26,528
Stiff at the back, mostly.

73
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,063
- SCOTT: Eli.
- Right, I'm on it.

74
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,801
SCOTT: Okay, guys, listen up!
Get your stuff, we're bugging out!

75
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,168
JOHANSEN: Wait, wait, wait.
We can't leave.

76
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,344
If it's something that they got here,
it could be contagious.

77
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,243
SCOTT: So, what are we supposed to do?

78
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,509
We have 36 hours
before the Destiny leaves.

79
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,017
For the sake of everyone else on board,

80
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,453
- I say we wait.
- SCOTT: Here? For what?

81
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,025
At least for a little while.
Just see how this plays out.

82
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:17,139
It could be anything, really,
a virus, a bacteria.

83
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,150
There's no way to know if it's airborne.

84
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,049
YOUNG: You've only been there three hours.

85
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,019
I know.
If it's something they picked up locally,

86
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:26,489
then the progression is unfolding quickly.
Sir, until we know more,

87
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,389
I'm recommending
that we don't return to the Destiny

88
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,394
with anything that might be contagious.

89
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,827
YOUNG: Roger that.

90
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:34,622
Let us know if anyone on board
is exhibiting similar symptoms.

91
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:38,067
At least that way we'll know for sure
if it has nothing to do with this planet.

92
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:41,173
YOUNG: Will do.
Check in every hour regardless.

93
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,538
- SCOTT: Copy that.
- Young out.

94
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,360
SCOTT: Shut it off, Greer.

95
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,474
RUSH: You must have some suspicions.
I've seen you giving them shots.

96
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:22,480
JOHANSEN: I started them both
on high doses of antibiotics.

97
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:26,177
I hate to waste it, but given the symptoms
of headache, fever and neck pain,

98
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:27,513
it's better to be safe than sorry.

99
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,316
Okay, so what is it, bacterial meningitis?

100
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:33,256
I don't know,
but if it turns out that's what it is,

101
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,259
and I haven't done anything,
they could die quickly.

102
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:39,024
You don't know.
You're using up our antibiotics on a hunch?

103
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:42,761
- Yes, that was my judgment call.
- That's great.

104
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:53,737
ELI: I thought you said it wasn't far.
SCOTT: It's not.

105
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,710
- You doing okay?
- Yeah, fine.

106
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,716
GREER: Over here.

107
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,811
ELI: Whoa! What is that smell?

108
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,957
RUSH: It's sulfur.

109
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,351
ELI: I'd hate to see the ants
who made those.

110
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,790
ELI: Hey, hey, hello! What are you doing?
Haven't you seen Alien?

111
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:16,866
You think this is
what's making people sick?

112
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,368
I don't know.

113
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,699
They make chemical weapons
from this stuff.

114
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:25,540
RUSH: Yeah, I know, but we don't know
the exact compound or concentration.

115
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,977
- Well, there's more over here.
- No, no, it's all right, I believe you.

116
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,507
Look, I'm just saying.
I know she doesn't want to make

117
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:38,557
anybody else on the ship sick, but
what if us staying here is going to kill us?

118
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,791
Well, this couldn't get much worse.

119
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:47,224
I'm afraid that's a failure of imagination.

120
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:52,102
Top five desert island movies.

121
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:56,566
What? It'll help pass the time.

122
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,473
Okay, I'll go first.

123
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,148
Hackers. Obvious, I know.

124
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:07,677
The Matrix. Old School.

125
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,987
You got to have
something to make you laugh, right?

126
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:16,319
If trilogies count as one,
then all three original Star Wars,

127
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:19,762
but if only one, then Empire.

128
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,001
That's four.

129
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:27,000
Man, this is hard. I could pick so many.

130
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:29,431
Maybe it should be top 10...

131
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:30,770
SCOTT: T.J.!
JOHANSEN: Yeah?

132
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:31,901
Good Will Hunting has got

133
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,275
- to be there somewhere.
- SCOTT: James is not doing well.

134
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,507
JOHANSEN: Where is she?
RUSH: How many does that make now?

135
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:40,308
That's Chloe, Volker,
Marsden and Franklin.

136
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,943
Now James, too.

137
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:44,249
- Wait a minute. Let me look at your eyes.
- SCOTT: No, I'm fine.

138
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,483
No, you're not. You need a shot, too.

139
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,434
Dial out! Dial the gate!

140
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,201
RUSH: Destiny, come in.

141
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,169
If you can hear me, please respond!

142
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,707
- What's wrong?
- I don't know!

143
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,901
- Why is it doing that?
- GREER: We've got to get out of here!

144
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,571
- RUSH: We can't!
- Why is it doing that?

145
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:43,013
Okay, what the...

146
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,451
Hey, did you guys hear?

147
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,111
VOLKER: Yeah, there was a Kino
already there?

148
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:50,711
How is that possible?

149
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,923
We dropped out of FTL, the gate dialed,

150
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,925
then we sent a Kino
to check out the planet.

151
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,652
They go through,
and there's another one already there

152
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,993
lying on the ground not far from the gate.

153
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:04,193
Hey, guys? We only sent one Kino, right?

154
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,869
Turns out the databank was full.

155
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,131
Looks like the databank is full.

156
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,271
Well, what's on it?

157
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,368
JAMES: Us.

158
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,447
What do you mean, "us"?

159
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:20,349
They're watching the recording now,
but I heard that a bunch of us are on it.

160
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,784
Doing what?

161
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,086
Going through the gate to the planet
to gather food.

162
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:28,388
Then apparently,
some people started getting sick.

163
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,260
I think that I was one of them.

164
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,660
But that didn't happen.

165
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:32,958
Obviously.

166
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,726
You're fine, right?

167
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,570
Apparently,
they found human remains, too.

168
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,137
It's weird, huh?

169
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,574
- You okay?
- Yeah, it just hit me.

170
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:58,121
- Are you sure you're okay otherwise?
- Yeah.

171
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,758
- Pretty understandable.
- Not to me.

172
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,525
- I was talking about the barfing.
- I was moving on.

173
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,699
How is this possible?

174
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:11,595
- I don't know.
- What about an alternate reality?

175
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,141
Sir, given the illness that developed
on the planet,

176
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:21,145
I suggest that we quarantine everyone
who went through to retrieve this Kino.

177
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:24,077
Scott, Greer, Eli and Rush.

178
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,211
And everyone they came in contact with
since returning.

179
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,253
- Well, that's all of us.
- JOHANSEN: Here.

180
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,879
I'll have to coordinate on radio.

181
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,458
Brody was also in the Gate Room
when they got back.

182
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:37,256
We were only there for,
like, a half hour at most.

183
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,625
That's more than enough time
to come in contact with a contagion.

184
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,290
SCOTT: Wait a second.

185
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,196
You're worried because people
got sick on this recording,

186
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:46,271
which never happened.

187
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,237
Well, we don't know that.

188
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:52,372
- What are you saying?
- RUSH: Well, that is clearly us.

189
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,605
The recording happened, somehow.

190
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,875
ELI: What do you think was wrong
with the gate?

191
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:59,678
It looks like the wormhole connection
was unstable.

192
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:03,244
It would have been extremely dangerous
to even attempt travel.

193
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,185
Sir?

194
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:09,616
Go.

195
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,767
So keep watching?

196
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,271
- CHLOE: Can you fast forward, please?
- Yeah.

197
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,849
Chloe's dead.

198
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,115
James, Spencer, Marsden,

199
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:41,148
Brody, all dead.

200
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,168
Something's wrong with the gate.

201
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:55,770
Rush doesn't think we can risk using it,
even with what's happened.

202
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:08,787
We can't reach Destiny on radio, either,
so apparently we're trapped here.

203
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,388
There's 22 hours
until Destiny jumps back into FTL.

204
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:22,233
The creatures seem to be nocturnal.

205
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:25,764
They stopped coming
once the sun came up.

206
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:30,131
Hopefully, the gate will start working
before it gets dark again.

207
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:35,111
Apparently, we don't have
much ammunition left.

208
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,839
RUSH: Eli, what are you doing?

209
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:52,789
ELI: Volker wasn't killed by the creatures.

210
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:55,696
T.J. says he died of the illness
during the night.

211
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,029
Everyone seems to be coming down

212
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,036
- with symptoms at this point...
- RUSH: Eli!

213
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:03,739
ELI: Do I need to point out yet again that
documenting this could be important?

214
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:06,369
See? See?

215
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,307
ELI: Who do you think
is ever gonna see that?

216
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,644
Us. Us! We are!

217
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,813
- You look ridiculous.
- ELI: It won't fly.

218
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,319
If someone hadn't shot it...

219
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:26,825
ELI: Scott was bitten by one of
the creatures. He's now in a coma.

220
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,296
Eli, you okay?

221
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,631
ELI: Compared to most
everyone else.

222
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,872
Don't go too far. We are under quarantine.

223
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,034
RUSH: Eli!

224
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,104
Sergeant Greer has found a cave nearby.

225
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:46,847
It could be our best chance to survive
another night if it comes down to that.

226
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,984
We could use some help!

227
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,818
Good man.

228
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,789
ELI: My turn.

229
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,059
Oh, sorry.

230
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:04,800
GREER: So, at least
it's a defensible position.

231
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:09,068
- Our backs to the wall.
- Better than being exposed on all sides.

232
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:23,985
ELI: I have a lot of respect for people
who do what you do.

233
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,392
It's not easy.

234
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:32,225
I can tell it really affects you
when you can't help people.

235
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,292
It does.

236
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:38,897
ELI: My mom was a nurse.

237
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:43,964
She got stuck by a needle trying
to restrain a junkie in the ER.

238
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,310
She got HIV.

239
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,377
JOHANSEN: I'm sorry.

240
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:58,119
ELI: My father couldn't handle it.
He just... He just left.

241
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:03,226
- I was 14 at the time.
- That must have been hard on you.

242
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:07,957
ELI: Do you have a family?

243
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:11,729
My parents. My dad's retired.

244
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:15,535
- ELI: What did he do?
- He was a tailor.

245
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:19,201
He's actually the one who taught me
how to do stitches.

246
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:23,441
I remember this one time he cut himself
pretty badly with some scissors,

247
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,450
and he sewed it up himself
and kept right on working.

248
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,486
ELI: Brothers or sisters?

249
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,650
A sister. She has two kids.

250
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,360
I miss them.

251
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:45,202
ELI: I'm really afraid that my mom's
just gonna give up if I die out here.

252
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:02,352
ELI: I remember as a kid, I was,
I don't know, maybe seven or eight,

253
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:06,490
my grandfather died,
and my parents took me to the funeral.

254
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:10,587
Watching his casket getting lowered
into the ground,

255
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:15,690
it was the first time that I realized
I was going to die one day.

256
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,467
I mean, I knew people died.

257
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:23,371
I'm talking about the idea
that my consciousness was going to end.

258
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:27,140
I wasn't going to see what happened
to the world. I...

259
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:32,516
It was such an empty, dark feeling,

260
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:38,550
like I was falling down a pitch-black hole.
It was... Scared the crap out of me.

261
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,557
I take it you don't believe in the afterlife.

262
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:47,260
ELI: That fear was
almost too much to handle.

263
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,761
I guess maybe I thought
I'd just get used to it.

264
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,999
- But you don't.
- ELI: No.

265
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:58,340
No, it scared me just as much every time.

266
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:02,772
RUSH: Most people realize their own
mortality at some stage of the game, Eli.

267
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:05,475
It's not a particularly unique experience.

268
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,983
ELI: I know.

269
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,317
The question is, did it change you?

270
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:16,417
Did it inspire you to make something
of this short existence that we have?

271
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:20,563
ELI: Well, I'm here, aren't I?

272
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:29,001
Of course, the Ancients evolved to a point
where their physical bodies

273
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,133
were no longer necessary,

274
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:35,172
found a way for consciousness
to become immortal.

275
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,976
ELI: You really think that's possible?

276
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,053
I know it is.

277
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,721
Maybe not for you and me, but that idea,

278
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,162
it's the reason why I ended up here.

279
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:02,405
ELI: So, you think if we learn enough,
that somehow,

280
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:07,937
somewhere out there we could discover
how it's done?

281
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,853
We have to make it through the day.

282
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:26,254
Hey. You okay?

283
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,157
It didn't happen.

284
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,862
Well, it's not clear what happened.

285
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:36,402
I know I didn't go to that planet and have
all those people die under my watch.

286
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,135
It wasn't your fault, Sergeant.

287
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:41,311
It didn't look like there was anything
you could have done differently.

288
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:44,576
I am not interested
in what did not happen.

289
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,379
Sir.

290
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:53,088
Regardless of how that recording
came into existence,

291
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:57,128
avoiding the issue is simple.
We just don't go back to that planet.

292
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:00,825
Doesn't bother you?

293
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:03,564
Like you said, it didn't happen.

294
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,698
Just a story, right?

295
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:10,035
I am curious to find out
how it turns out, though.

296
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,809
Not me.

297
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:20,208
Whoa!

298
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,313
YOUNG: What just happened?

299
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:27,256
She started complaining
that her head hurt, and she just dropped.

300
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:30,287
It's been three hours
since we dropped out of FTL.

301
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:34,855
That's about the time people began
to get sick on the planet in the recording.

302
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:38,937
- SCOTT: T.J.!
- Yeah, over here.

303
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:39,062
- SCOTT: T.J.!
- Yeah, over here.

304
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:42,005
JOHANSEN: Right here.

305
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:45,242
You said she just passed out?
I've got four more cases.

306
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:48,279
So far, everyone who went to the planet
or came in contact with someone who did.

307
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,972
Can it be contained?

308
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,176
I don't know, but whatever it is,
it's extremely virulent.

309
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:57,015
On the Kino recording,
Eli said Volker died because of it.

310
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:00,724
- How quickly?
- Within 12 hours.

311
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,362
GREER: M4 Carbine.

312
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:13,328
Hold the grip firmly,
stock braced against your shoulder.

313
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:14,901
It's got a kick.

314
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,134
Keep your finger off the trigger

315
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,675
until you're ready to kill
whatever it is you're pointing at.

316
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,269
Short bursts. We don't got much ammo.

317
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:26,111
- Go ahead.
- ELI: You mean shoot for real?

318
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,318
That way.

319
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,282
Okay...

320
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,323
Safety's off.

321
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:42,192
ELI: Whoa! Oh, man!

322
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:44,830
What happened to short bursts?

323
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:04,484
- ELI: You sure they're down there?
- Saw them go home last night.

324
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,716
ELI: You really think this is a good idea?

325
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,260
The best defense is offense.

326
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:16,332
- Fire in the hole.
- ELI: Yeah, literally.

327
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,734
ELI: I hope we didn't just piss them off.

328
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,610
Okay.

329
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:37,347
Oh!

330
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,690
ELI: Okay, that's disgusting.

331
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:53,436
Come on.
We got more of these things to hit.

332
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:02,212
His pulse is very weak.

333
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:07,174
ELI: Did using the other remote help?

334
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:11,187
We were able to get a connection,
but the wormhole is still unstable.

335
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,587
Nothing from Destiny on the radio.

336
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:17,594
ELI: Well, is it broken, or is there a chance
it could resolve by itself?

337
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:20,859
There are a number of things that could
be causing temporary interference.

338
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:24,230
ELI: Well, we have 11 hours until Destiny
is supposed to jump back into FTL.

339
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:27,032
There's no way of telling
how long it's going to last.

340
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,300
ELI: And I guess it would be crazy
to try and go anyway.

341
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:35,641
Look, we can't assume that the gate
is actually even connecting to Destiny.

342
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:40,073
There'd be very little chance of surviving
an unstable wormhole.

343
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:42,647
JOHANSEN: A fire would be nice.

344
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,416
- I couldn't find any dry wood.
- Huh.

345
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:56,364
Are they still watching the recording?

346
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:57,560
Yeah.

347
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,928
I don't know what to do.
They just keep showing up,

348
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,133
and I don't have nearly enough antibiotics
for all these people.

349
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,378
It would help if I knew the cause.

350
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,917
JOHANSEN: You're not feeling good?
PARK: No.

351
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:17,220
JOHANSEN: Let's go slow.

352
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,064
ELI: See anything?
RUSH: No.

353
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:39,270
ELI: Good. Maybe we got them all today.

354
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:49,614
ELI: Did you see that? Did you see
something? I think I saw something!

355
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:53,452
GREER: If you see anything move out there,
don't ask, just shoot.

356
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:56,689
ELI: Right. Right, okay.

357
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:09,939
Hey. Hey, I think the batteries in this one
are dead.

358
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:14,210
The Kino has night vision.
Why didn't I turn it on?

359
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:19,807
Oh. Never mind.

360
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,557
Oh, my...

361
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:37,190
GREER: Come on, come on! Come on!

362
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:46,911
I don't think we're going to make it.

363
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:01,615
ELI: I'm out!

364
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:05,525
Come on, come on, come on! Give me!

365
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,599
Hey, hey! Where are you going?

366
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,765
He's crazy. You're crazy!

367
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,767
You are.

368
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:18,675
ELI: Come back! Wait!

369
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:25,081
Son of a...

370
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:33,614
Wait! Stop!

371
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,157
Someone's got to try.

372
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,058
Look, I'll radio if I make it.
You'll know it's safe.

373
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:40,695
ELI: If? But you said...

374
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:44,797
Hey, for a moment there,
I thought we were in trouble.

375
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:48,772
ELI: What?

376
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:55,441
"For a moment there,
I thought we were in trouble"?

377
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,582
YOUNG: Butch Cassidy
and the Sundance Kid.

378
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:04,187
It's Butch's last line before he and
Sundance run out to face the Bolivians.

379
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:06,418
One of my favorites, too.

380
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:10,517
Well, well, we do have
something in common after all.

381
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:14,824
Eli.

382
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:21,001
ELI: Destiny?

383
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:22,931
Come in!

384
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,550
GREER: You like that? Come on!

385
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:36,381
ELI: Greer!
GREER: Come on, baby!

386
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:45,092
ELI: Oh, my God.

387
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:49,992
Colonel Young. Dr. Rush.

388
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:56,566
- RUSH: What is it?
- Some sort of microorganism.

389
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,370
Something brought back from the planet?

390
00:27:58,476 --> 00:27:59,704
Not the planet they just went to.

391
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:02,177
The planet you and Scott went to,
the ice planet.

392
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,111
That was weeks ago. How do you know?

393
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:06,777
This is a sample of the water
we've been drinking, isn't it?

394
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:09,319
When people outside the quarantine
started coming down with symptoms

395
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:11,412
I knew we needed to look
for another common source.

396
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,718
But we tested it at the time.

397
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:15,452
At the time, we couldn't see it.

398
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,028
The microscope just wasn't
powerful enough,

399
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:19,790
and the organism was just too small.

400
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,593
Well, it isn't now.

401
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,100
It's possible that a batch of water
wasn't purified properly

402
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,965
and it contaminated the rest.

403
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:27,436
YOUNG: So we've all got it?

404
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,564
Well, everyone's immune system
is different.

405
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:32,666
The time it takes for symptoms to emerge
will vary.

406
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:36,577
But once it's strong enough to pass
from the blood to the nervous system,

407
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:40,506
it works fast,
and the antibiotics won't cut it.

408
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:45,012
Well, for a moment there,
I thought we were in trouble.

409
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,434
Eli! Eli?

410
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,213
Eli.

411
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:15,949
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

412
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,673
It's 45 minutes until Destiny
jumps back into FTL.

413
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:52,089
Everyone here is dead except me.

414
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:57,518
I don't remember much after we
were attacked the first night.

415
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:02,896
One of the creatures bit me,
and I lost consciousness.

416
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:09,833
I'd been starting to feel sick,
headache, pain in the back of the neck.

417
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:14,106
The bite still hurts like a bitch,
but everything else is better.

418
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:20,577
The gate still doesn't seem to be working.
I can't reach Destiny on the radio.

419
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,320
I'm hoping it's just
a communications problem

420
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:27,516
and that everything else is okay up there.

421
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,551
I'm sending this through,
and I'm expecting

422
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:34,120
that you will send some sort of a signal
that it is safe to proceed.

423
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:37,996
I will wait as long as I can,
and then I'll head through regardless.

424
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:42,665
On my own,
I likely won't survive the night here.

425
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,393
What just happened?

426
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:16,064
It went back in time.

427
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:24,805
- What are you doing?
- Making sure it hasn't happened yet.

428
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,741
What hasn't happened yet?

429
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:30,480
RUSH: A solar flare.
It's the only explanation.

430
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:34,354
If a wormhole's trajectory
takes it too close to a star

431
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:37,087
and it passes through an active solar flare,

432
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:39,925
it can cause it to move forwards
or backwards in time.

433
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:43,522
In some cases, the wormhole can actually
loop back around

434
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:47,969
and connect to the same gate
in a different time. In this case, the past.

435
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:53,401
Whoa, whoa!
Okay, this is making my brain hurt.

436
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:58,711
Oh, my God. Back to the Future.

437
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,042
How can I not put that on my list?

438
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:04,519
The "us" on that recording dropped out
of FTL and went to the planet.

439
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:08,456
Sometime later, a solar flare occurred
preventing normal gate travel.

440
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,586
So Scott thought that he was sending
the Kino back to the Destiny,

441
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:16,663
but he was actually sending it back
to the planet but in the past.

442
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:20,634
God, that is so weird to think
that was really us on the Kino.

443
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:22,706
RUSH: Us in a previous unaltered timeline,

444
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:25,469
modified now by the introduction
of the Kino from the future.

445
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:28,943
Why are we dialing the gate back there?

446
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:32,210
As I said, to make sure the solar flare
that disrupted gate travel

447
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:33,944
hasn't happened yet.

448
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:36,680
Thankfully, it hasn't.

449
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:38,952
Yeah, but why do we care about that?

450
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:42,123
Because I think we might
have to go back there.

451
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:53,227
I'd been starting to feel sick,
headache, pain in the back of the neck.

452
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:58,034
The bite still hurts like a bitch,
but everything else is better.

453
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:00,476
It's possible, I guess.

454
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:04,241
The venoms of various animals,
snakes, spiders, scorpions,

455
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:06,374
they've all been tested
for their antibiotic properties.

456
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:09,578
Wait, you're saying that thing that bit me
can actually cure

457
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:11,985
- what's making everybody sick?
- You fell into a coma.

458
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:15,526
It obviously releases some sort of venom
when it bites.

459
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:18,987
You apparently survived,
said you were feeling better.

460
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:25,002
But you were just guessing
and those things were... Well...

461
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:30,137
Based on this video, people are going
to die from this infection and quickly.

462
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,334
I know it seems
like a wild stab in the dark,

463
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:33,876
but I don't know what else to do.

464
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:35,502
YOUNG: We've all been exposed,

465
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:38,548
so it's just a matter of time
before we all get it, right?

466
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:43,844
I'll go, sir.

467
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:46,890
Not by yourself, you won't.

468
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:53,393
We don't need liabilities, Scott.

469
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,630
Well, I'm good to go, sir.

470
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,199
ELI: Getting Kino visuals.

471
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:02,295
It's nighttime and...
Oh, hey, surprise, surprise, it's raining.

472
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:04,068
Which means those things
will probably be out.

473
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:05,335
GREER: That's too bad.

474
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:08,708
They were easy pickings when they were
sleeping in their nests during the day.

475
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:10,303
YOUNG: Well, we can't wait.

476
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,245
ELI: According to the time stamp
on the recording,

477
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,580
you have an hour
until the first team lost contact

478
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:17,210
- because of the solar flare.
- Forty-five minutes, to be safe.

479
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:18,879
How many do you think we'll need?

480
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,322
Hopefully,
a small dosage of the venom will do it.

481
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:24,395
- Dead or alive?
- Alive, preferably.

482
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:26,861
I can't exactly anticipate the physiology.

483
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,032
Not much time.

484
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,228
Good luck.

485
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:52,280
What?

486
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:56,390
Her pulse is very weak.

487
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:59,929
I just want you to be prepared.

488
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,328
I'm not sure she's going to make it.

489
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,298
Of course she is.

490
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:40,801
We're out of antibiotics.

491
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:53,412
Why do people always wait until times like
these to tell someone how they really feel?

492
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:57,053
It's so stupid. I just...

493
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:06,853
Screw it.

494
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:13,093
We haven't known each other that long,

495
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:17,300
but I think we make each other happy.

496
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:23,508
When I'm near you, things are just better.

497
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:30,047
You don't even know
how amazing you are.

498
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:35,687
It doesn't matter.

499
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:45,458
I've never had a best friend before.

500
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:52,501
Never. Never known anyone
like that before, never loved...

501
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,877
I just...

502
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:04,280
I need to make sure that you know

503
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:09,015
that I'm here for you.

504
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:14,464
Always will be.

505
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,139
Please, don't die.

506
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,589
Eli,

507
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,586
she's gone.

508
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:47,653
SPENCER: I don't see anything!
SCOTT: They gotta be here somewhere.

509
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:50,484
Colonel Young, this is Rush. Come in.

510
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,053
I read you. Go ahead.

511
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,226
- Checking in.
- Nothing yet.

512
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,896
It's raining pretty hard.

513
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:03,303
I'm sorry to have to tell you
we've already lost four people.

514
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:08,441
Drs. Franklin and Volker, Lieutenant James

515
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,206
and Chloe.

516
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:18,786
YOUNG: Copy that.
Check in again in 10 minutes.

517
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:22,990
Lieutenant. Lieutenant, we need you.

518
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,257
Scott!

519
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:30,991
Scott!

520
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:36,798
We need you.

521
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,511
Colonel Young, come in, please.

522
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:02,483
Colonel Young, do you read?

523
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:12,363
If you've found this, it's because
a solar flare interfered with gate travel,

524
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:16,472
and I managed
to send this Kino back in time.

525
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:21,207
All right, listen very carefully.

526
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:24,804
There is a disease in the water
we brought back from the ice planet.

527
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:29,249
It is fatal, and we have all been drinking it,
but there is hope.

528
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:35,687
There's a creature that lives on this planet,
lots of them, actually,

529
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,954
that could hold the key to saving you.

530
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:41,793
In small doses,
their venom actually cures the disease,

531
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:45,335
but be very careful. They're deadly.
They're also nocturnal.

532
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:47,028
They only come out at night.

533
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:50,004
You can get them during the day
while they're asleep in their nests,

534
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:52,507
and they're not far from the gate.

535
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:05,320
Come on!

536
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:13,027
Please believe me.
You don't have much time.

537
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:18,067
Act now, or you are all going to die.
