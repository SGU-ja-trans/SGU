00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,557
RUSH: This is what Destiny intended from
the moment it entered the star system.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,429
YOUNG: We are going to survive.
We are going to make it home.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,074
I'm telling you,
the ship came here for a reason!

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,598
RUSH: Destiny is powered
by the stars themselves.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,590
WRAY: He and Young
are bumping heads, yes.

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,194
Not sure which camp is the better choice.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,679
YOUNG: We just pretend
nothing happened?

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,399
We need to be ready
for the next encounter.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,436
For the sake of the crew.

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,873
For the sake of the crew.

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,111
- They're coming.
- Who's coming, David?

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,758
The Lucian Alliance.
They're coming to take Destiny.

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,115
They've got something to open the doors!

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,071
- Take cover!
- Grenade!

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,553
Fall back!

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,394
You'll be... You'll be okay.

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,072
- What happened?
- You were shot.

18
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,195
YOUNG: You are surrounded.

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,633
Lay down your weapons,

20
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,359
or we will vent the entire compartment
to space.

21
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,668
- Can they do it?
- Yes.

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,988
Then they should have.

23
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,559
JOHANSEN: Rush! Wait!

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,116
We will not be complying
with your request to surrender.

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,516
We have 12 missing
and presumed captured,

26
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,512
including Riley, T.J., Chloe, and Eli.

27
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,831
I am going to save
every one of those hostages,

28
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,879
and I'm going to retake this ship.
Do you understand me?

29
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,753
This is Young.

30
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,989
We've got the medical supplies
you requested.

31
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,038
We are prepared to give them to you
as a show of good faith.

32
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,155
KIVA: Thank you.

33
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,153
One condition.

34
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,558
You and I meet to make the exchange.

35
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,789
Agreed.

36
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,879
Let's do this.

37
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,708
Brody?

38
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,354
Ready.

39
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,591
Remember, quick kills, center mass.

40
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,959
Yes, sir.

41
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,714
All right.

42
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,397
You ready to do this?

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,433
We're ready.

44
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,432
Bring the medic.

45
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,113
Open the door.

46
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,948
I'm in.

47
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,913
- Who's this?
- Ronald Greer is also a medic.

48
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,391
KIVA: Another offer of good faith?

49
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,596
In exchange for Lieutenant Johansen.

50
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,398
First things first.

51
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,516
Go and check the supplies
and see they're what you need.

52
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,155
- Hold your fire!
- KIVA: Don't shoot!

53
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,034
No, no, no, no. Power just went out
throughout the whole ship!

54
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,998
I can see that, Mr. Brody.
Please step aside.

55
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,156
T.J., get behind me.

56
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,993
She takes one step in your direction,
and I will shoot her myself.

57
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,991
I've got the shot, sir.

58
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,109
My men have been ordered to
execute the prisoners if I am killed.

59
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,270
Step back in my direction.

60
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,792
Sir, I've got the shot.

61
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,279
Stand down, Sergeant.

62
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,433
Damn it.

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,433
- What happened?
- They surprised us.

64
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,033
What do you mean?

65
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,031
They surprised us.
Do you want me to explain it again?

66
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,475
The hostages are useless to us
if they're dead!

67
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,949
At least they serve a purpose.

68
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,556
Tell them. Tell them!

69
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,594
Colonel.

70
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,039
I'm here.

71
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,271
She just killed Rivers.

72
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,039
Understood.

73
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,592
Hey, don't fall asleep. It's dangerous.

74
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,072
That's a concussion.

75
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,318
Okay, then it's boring.

76
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,398
So, what do you think
they'll do with them?

77
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,275
Who?

78
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,558
The prisoners.

79
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,276
Probably drop them off on some planet.
I don't know.

80
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,430
I just hope everyone's okay.

81
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,551
I just hope it's over.

82
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,879
Well, not much we can do about it.

83
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,348
So, rest time is over.

84
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,429
ELI: Ah!

85
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,192
This feels familiar.

86
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,877
- What the hell just happened?
- We still don't know.

87
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,316
We're just getting systems back online,
then maybe we can analyze...

88
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,118
Screw analyze! Fix it!

89
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,431
- We've got to know what's broken first.
- Do it now!

90
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,398
- Rivers is dead.
- What?

91
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,874
Well, it was going to be someone.

92
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,591
BRODY: Whoa, whoa,
whoa! Whoa!

93
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,673
Would you prefer it was Chloe or Eli?
Lieutenant Johansen, perhaps?

94
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,112
Don't bloody tell me
you weren't thinking the same thing.

95
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,556
I want you to figure out
what's wrong with the ship and fix it.

96
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,278
Fix it now.

97
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,152
I have orders to help.

98
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,878
What's your name?

99
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,749
Koz.

100
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,155
I'll let you know what I need.

101
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,355
You do know there is a way to save them.

102
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,749
You're just not wired to consider it.

103
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,070
I'm not surrendering this ship.

104
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,358
And what exactly is so wonderful about it?

105
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,911
We give up, she kills everyone

106
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,911
except for those who have value to her,

107
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,436
and let me tell you,
that's not a hell of a lot of people.

108
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,314
Colonel?

109
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,389
This is Young.

110
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,994
I would like to speak to the civilian.

111
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,113
This is Camile Wray.

112
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,510
Colonel Young has proved
that he cannot be trusted.

113
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,794
Can you?

114
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,229
Yes.

115
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,153
Then why did you let them
plan an ambush?

116
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,111
I voiced my disagreement.

117
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,670
And you could not stop them?

118
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,797
No, obviously not.

119
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,316
For that, one of your men was killed.

120
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,278
If you fail to live up to your promise twice,

121
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,437
I will kill again.

122
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,112
Do you understand?

123
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,590
No, I don't understand,
but I do believe you.

124
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,555
Then I would like to take you up
on your initial offer,

125
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,916
with one modification.

126
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,354
Four of your men for four of ours,

127
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,435
and food and water for three days.

128
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,078
Will food and water be offered
to the hostages?

129
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,670
They're no good to me dead.

130
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,758
Then we're agreed.

131
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,315
Next time we take supplies with us
in the first wave.

132
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,436
If there is a next time.

133
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,950
Damn it. Flashlight, flashlight!

134
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,518
- What's happening?
- Well, I don't know, Koz.

135
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,672
I'm up to my wrists
in someone's body right now.

136
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,756
Do we have any answers yet?

137
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,798
Just the one.

138
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,869
Every crash has been exactly
46 minutes, 37.4 seconds apart.

139
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,949
So?

140
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,153
Well, it'll be easier to show you. Brody?

141
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,872
Okay, so, what am I looking at?

142
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,072
That's our problem. It's a binary pulsar.

143
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,635
It's the combination of
a rotating neutron star

144
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,759
and probably a white dwarf orbiting
around a single point in space.

145
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,876
What does that mean to us?

146
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,997
Pulsars give off gamma radiation
and x-rays as they rotate,

147
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,753
short, deadly bursts of ionized radiation.

148
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,637
The shield and the hull are
protecting us right now.

149
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,678
Right, but the pulsar is literally
feeding off of the white dwarf,

150
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,354
stripping off material and
creating an accretion disk.

151
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,715
And the white dwarf plows through
that material every orbit.

152
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,870
Which gives off
an even bigger gamma ray burst,

153
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,837
on top of
what we're already getting hit with,

154
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,559
and that's why our systems
are shutting down.

155
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,359
The shield has to draw extra power
in order to compensate.

156
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,911
And that happens every 46 minutes,
37.4 seconds.

157
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,073
It's what killed their man,
and it's going to be what kills us.

158
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,470
The Lucian Alliance just happened to
dial in when the damn thing was in range.

159
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,199
Destiny had to drop out of FTL
to make the connection.

160
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,316
It's bad timing, bad luck.

161
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,833
Well, then, why are we still here?

162
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,831
Our FTL capability has been compromised.

163
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,751
- Compromised?
- Don't yell.

164
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,955
We don't know why yet.

165
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,032
The shield is what's keeping us alive,
but sooner or later,

166
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,998
it's going to fail, and when it does...

167
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,073
We're dead.

168
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,994
Yeah.

169
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,989
The radiation burst is what's
causing the system malfunctions.

170
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,752
Which will only get worse.

171
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,798
Because the shield will fail eventually, yes.

172
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,677
Unless we can find a way
to make the jump to FTL.

173
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,469
How much time?

174
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,792
Well, according to Rush,
we can withstand two more of the bursts.

175
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,837
People will start dying by the third.

176
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,478
TELFORD: I saw what one of those bursts
did to a man

177
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,393
when he wasn't protected
by the ship's hull.

178
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,998
First we'll make the trade,
and then we'll discuss this new problem.

179
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,430
Has their medic completed
Varro's surgery?

180
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,794
Not yet.

181
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,836
Well, then find out what's taking so long.

182
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,194
I'll do it.

183
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,800
Lieutenant, she told me to
check on your progress.

184
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,872
Tell her it'd be a hell of a lot faster
if the damn lights didn't keep going off.

185
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,996
Well, that's a whole other problem.

186
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,277
The Destiny came out of FTL
within range of a pulsar.

187
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,676
We don't have much time
before the shield fails.

188
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,751
Colonel Young and his people are
trying to solve it, but...

189
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,558
She won't let them.

190
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,230
I'll do my best to convince her.

191
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,719
You do that.

192
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,032
Lieutenant Scott?

193
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,915
We've got the supplies
that they requested,

194
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,230
and we're ready to make
the prisoner exchange.

195
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,594
Copy that.

196
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,397
I'm fine, I'm fine.

197
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,638
And Varro?

198
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,790
I've done all I can for him.

199
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,834
SOLDIER 1: Hold it steady.
Here, use this one.

200
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,953
- Will he live?
- I got the bullet out

201
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,157
and stopped the bleeding,
so he should have a chance.

202
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,038
I'd like to take a look
at the other wounded.

203
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,188
Fine.

204
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,554
Let's go.

205
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,835
- You got it?
- Camile? Camile?

206
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,839
What's this?

207
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,074
A flak vest. Just in case.

208
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,708
How can I expect them to trust me

209
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,997
if I can't even demonstrate
a willingness to trust them in turn?

210
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,868
With all due respect, ma'am,
I don't think they can be trusted.

211
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,597
You tell Colonel Young
I appreciate his concern.

212
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,792
Yeah, the Colonel said
you wouldn't take it.

213
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,155
I just thought I'd try anyway.

214
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,389
- Are you sure about this, sir?
- No.

215
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,151
Good enough for me.

216
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,678
I hope you make a better impression
than I did.

217
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,596
Commander Kiva, are you ready?

218
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,588
We are.

219
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,752
Brody, open it.

220
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,396
Lieutenant, thank you.
I'll take it from here.

221
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,672
Okay, Mr. Brody.

222
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,591
I asked for civilians.

223
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,879
- These are the two we had.
- We agreed on four for four.

224
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,674
Four.

225
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,389
- What about Lieutenant Johansen?
- She stays.

226
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,313
Even if we figure out a way
to jump back into FTL,

227
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,038
and right now, the odds are not good...

228
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,599
Then we'll be right back where we started.

229
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,231
Yes, but this doesn't have to end
with one of us losing.

230
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,550
If we could just figure out a way
to work with each other...

231
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,553
I can see that you're someone
who enjoys talking through problems,

232
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,359
but if you don't solve this new one,

233
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,671
then neither of us will have
anything to talk about.

234
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,074
Brody.

235
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,949
All right, get in the infirmary.

236
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,157
Where's Chloe and Eli?

237
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,638
She said they were the only two civilians.

238
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,711
Then where the hell are they?

239
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,551
It's gonna be just...

240
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,716
Sorry, sorry. Sorry.

241
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,233
Take a break, Eli.

242
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,630
No, no, no, no.
We've got to be getting close by now.

243
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,272
You know what?

244
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,715
We should do this twice a week.

245
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,076
This is the kind of exercise
that really motivates me.

246
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,950
Carrying a wounded person the length
of the whole ship in low oxygen?

247
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,039
Good times.

248
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,072
CHLOE: Thank you, Eli.

249
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,514
Wait till it's your turn to carry me.

250
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,471
You're an amazing friend.

251
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,472
ELI: You can never have too many of those.

252
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,314
Unless you're one of
those people on Facebook

253
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,470
who just accepts
everybody's friend request.

254
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,795
It's like, come on, you know,
be a little selective.

255
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,879
Eli!

256
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,229
Damn it!

257
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,711
Sorry. Sorry.

258
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,390
- It's okay.
- Are you okay?

259
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,154
I'm okay.

260
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,474
Yeah.

261
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,274
Sorry.

262
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,479
Okay, thanks.

263
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,638
- There's no sign of Eli or Chloe.
- You know, maybe they...

264
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,996
There's no fatalities on our side
except for Rivers.

265
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,913
- They must be hiding somewhere.
- I hope so.

266
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,669
Look, that boy would take a bullet

267
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,638
before he'd let them
touch a hair on her head.

268
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,518
Lieutenant, don't get distracted.

269
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,670
I'm not, I'm not, I just...

270
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,195
I just want to get this done with.

271
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,918
And I wish the Colonel
would give the word

272
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,958
so that we can go in there
and properly resolve the situation.

273
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,555
Look, he'll do the right thing
when the right time comes.

274
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,200
You got to trust that 100%.

275
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,550
I don't know how you do it, man.

276
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,716
Well, you need to learn.

277
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,913
Thank you.

278
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,999
Your Commander already showed
her appreciation by not killing me.

279
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,958
It must be difficult to be forced
to save the life of your enemy.

280
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,191
No. I would have done it anyway.

281
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,596
- How's the pain?
- Bearable.

282
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,440
- Look, I'm trying to say...
- I don't really care.

283
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,431
I've been on my feet for far too long,

284
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,273
and I have other patients, so excuse me.

285
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,833
Conserving air or unconscious?

286
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,958
Just thinking.

287
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,719
About what?

288
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,079
I used to think I had a lot of friends,

289
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,513
but I don't.

290
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,030
They're a billion light years away,
but they're still your friends.

291
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,914
No, they don't really care about me.

292
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,312
- And I don't really care about them either.
- That's nice.

293
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,234
No, no, because until I met you,

294
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,949
I didn't really know what a friend was.

295
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,270
Do you know what I mean, Eli?

296
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,035
No.

297
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,669
A friend is someone
who will support you no matter what.

298
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,392
- Like you.
- Chloe, why don't we...

299
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,917
And I am not just saying that
because I feel like I'm going to pass out,

300
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,516
- and even if I do, I just want to say it first.
- And you did, so...

301
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,591
But whenever I say stuff like that to you,

302
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,514
you always react like I've just awarded
you some runner-up prize,

303
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,319
and it's not.

304
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,028
I know.

305
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,549
- It's just that...
- I know.

306
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,438
Of course you do.

307
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,639
Hey, there's a console over there.

308
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,514
I didn't notice that when we came in.

309
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,437
And it's got power.

310
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,119
- Can you call for help?
- I can try.

311
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,033
Dr. Park?

312
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,597
Look, it's not much of a solution,

313
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,911
but we don't have to shield the entire ship.

314
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,753
- Just the side facing the pulsar, right?
- Right.

315
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,796
We'll have to leave some shielding
on the underside of the ship,

316
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,155
but we should be able to transfer
something like 90%.

317
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,232
Should buy us enough time
to restore FTL capability.

318
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,073
So why haven't you guys done it yet?

319
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,957
Because it can't be done from
inside the ship.

320
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,474
Well, it could, if we had control of
the core systems, but we don't, so...

321
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,676
No, no, look, look, someone's gonna
have to go for a walk.

322
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,233
RUSH: I can tell you where to go,
what to do.

323
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,919
The mechanics of it are relatively simple.

324
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,958
Yeah, well, then why don't you
put on a space suit and do it?

325
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,511
Well, you get the FTL drive back online
while I'm gone, and you got a deal.

326
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,910
- We'll get it done, sir.
- I know you will. Gear up.

327
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,757
WRAY: They have only the time between
the gamma ray bursts

328
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,751
to complete their work.

329
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,354
The next one is less than
20 minutes from now,

330
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,635
so obviously time is an issue.

331
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,277
So what do you need from us?

332
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,512
There's a hull breach in the access corridor
that's under your control.

333
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,633
It's the exit point closest to the array.

334
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,756
We need you to let us in.

335
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,959
Transfer control of
all the ship systems to us,

336
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,759
and we will let them in.

337
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,070
You do understand that
if you don't help us save this ship,

338
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,513
we will all die.

339
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,511
Oh, I understand completely,

340
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,631
and I want you to transfer
the ship's systems to us.

341
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,669
When was the last time
you ran a security sweep in there?

342
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,830
Never mind, I'll do it. Radio?

343
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,433
Calvos, this is Telford.
Give me access to the damaged section.

344
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,152
You tell me. You think she's bluffing?

345
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,468
She doesn't have to.

346
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,993
She knows who she's dealing with.

347
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,117
But to be fair,
you don't have much of a choice.

348
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,231
At least they'll keep some of us alive,
for a while, anyway.

349
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,639
Yeah, like you.

350
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,188
You forget I've recently been
in their employment.

351
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,396
I wouldn't envy me just yet.

352
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,039
David?

353
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,269
Yeah, Everett.

354
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,157
It's about damn time.

355
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,159
Listen, do it.

356
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,674
Transfer control of the ship
and surrender yourselves.

357
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,751
Everyone but Rush and Brody.

358
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,274
Have them retreat to one of
the auxiliary control rooms.

359
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,873
They're going to notice Rush is missing.

360
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,155
Tell them he panicked and ran away.
They'll believe it.

361
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,674
By the time they start looking for him,
it'll be too late.

362
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,988
At the first available opportunity,

363
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,559
I'll access one of the Gate Room consoles

364
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,108
and transfer control of the ship
back to Rush.

365
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,555
The second they find out,
they're going to start shooting prisoners.

366
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,790
Then I won't let them find out.

367
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,197
Not right away, anyway.

368
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,517
I won't lock them out completely.

369
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,990
They can have control of the ship
until I decide they can't.

370
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,957
They'll herd all of the prisoners
into one compartment.

371
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,598
If they don't, I'll suggest it.

372
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,399
When they do,
I'll contact Rush on this channel.

373
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,391
I'll tell him which compartment,
then he can vent the atmosphere

374
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,038
from all the surrounding ones.

375
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,951
Where are you going to be?

376
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,759
You let me worry about that. I got to go.

377
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,033
It's all clear.

378
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,031
Best not to stick around.

379
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,349
This is Colonel Young.

380
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,431
I am prepared to surrender control
of this ship

381
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,239
provided certain conditions are met.

382
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,393
KIVA: Go ahead.

383
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,756
I need you to guarantee me
the safety of my people.

384
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,714
Agreed.

385
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:16,590
Nobody gets hurt during the changeover,
and no retribution afterwards.

386
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,553
Anything else?

387
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,839
That's all.

388
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,912
Well, Mr. Brody, time to panic and run off.

389
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,319
VOLKER: Hold on a sec.

390
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,870
We just got a message from
an unexplored part of the ship.

391
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,593
It's Eli. What are we going to do?

392
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,194
Well, you got to go. Good luck.

393
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,033
Yeah, you, too.

394
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,431
Transfer control to them.

395
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,959
Anything?

396
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,436
I wrote it in Ancient,
so it could take a while for somebody to...

397
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,955
- What is it?
- We got a message.

398
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,958
What's it say?

399
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,188
Oh, no.

400
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,991
We better stay put.

401
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,875
- Transfer complete.
- Open them.

402
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,270
No shooting. That's a good sign.

403
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,790
I think the stitching is torn.

404
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,155
You're moving around too much.

405
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,636
I understand your anger at losing the ship,

406
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,359
but it wasn't really yours to begin with.

407
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,831
When all this is settled, past sins
on both sides will have to be forgiven.

408
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,069
Truce?

409
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,193
Open them.

410
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,158
Forty-six minutes, gentlemen.

411
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,434
Yes, sir.

412
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,473
They're in.

413
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,751
Attenuating the shield strength
in that compartment.

414
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,115
Dialing back artificial gravity.

415
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,831
Commander, one of the power relays
just went down.

416
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,352
- Is something wrong?
- We just lost a power relay.

417
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,068
Then why aren't you dealing with it?

418
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,759
Go. Go. I can open and close doors.

419
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,073
This is it?

420
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,958
Yeah, it's where he said it was going to be.

421
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,872
- No, no, no, no.
- What happened?

422
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,951
The transfers just stopped.

423
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,358
What's the matter?

424
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,518
It won't lock.

425
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,912
Colonel Young, this is Scott.
How are we doing for time?

426
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,513
14 minutes.

427
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:18,355
This is Calvos.
Kiva and Telford have both been shot.

428
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,437
The Commander is still breathing,
but unconscious.

429
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,317
DANNIC: Get them to the medic.
CALVOS: Yes, sir.

430
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,994
- Is there any sign of the enemy?
- None.

431
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,073
- Where are your men?
- What?

432
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,196
Your soldiers.
How did they get into the Gate Room?

433
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,238
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

434
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,629
I've got people outside this ship!

435
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,197
The enemy has somehow
breached our lines.

436
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,794
Both Telford and Kiva have been shot.

437
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,552
I'm assuming command.

438
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,989
Colonel Young, this is Scott.

439
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,753
Ready to come back in. Lower the shield.

440
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,035
I repeat, this is Scott, over.

441
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,951
The shield is still up.
We cannot get back inside.

442
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,230
They just saved our damn lives.
Lower the shield.

443
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,914
- Keep moving.
- Lower the damn shield!

444
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,272
Lower the shield.

445
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,396
Try a different channel!

446
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,114
This is Scott. Please respond!

447
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,235
Lieutenant, something's gone wrong.

448
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,072
We have to find you another way
back inside the ship.

449
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,673
No, no, no, there's no time for that, Rush!

450
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,672
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what other way is there?

451
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,188
There's an airlock in forward section.

452
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,269
Yeah, we think it's an airlock.

453
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,191
It's in a totally unexplored part of the ship.

454
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,192
- Besides, we can't open it from here.
- Eli.

455
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,715
Eli.

456
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,837
Lieutenant, I need you to head back
towards the front of the ship.

457
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,353
Negative, negative!

458
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,953
Listen to me, that's the way in.

459
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,474
We're looking at the way in right now.

460
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,957
You need to go there
as quickly as you can.

461
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,598
Go right now.

462
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,558
We're on our way.

463
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,519
- What's going on?
- I'm getting a message.

464
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,114
- What's it say?
- That I got to go.

465
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,998
- What do you mean?
- I'm telling them where you are,

466
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,594
so you'll be safe until they come.

467
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,033
- Where are you going?
- Whatever happens, you know, right?

468
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,391
Eli, you're scaring me.

469
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,315
- I got to go.
- Eli!

470
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,948
Calvos. What happened?

471
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,638
Come on, come on.

472
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,237
DANNIC: Separate the civilians.

473
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,754
Take them to another compartment.

474
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,672
This is Varro. What are you doing?

475
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,035
I'm going to put an end to this.

476
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,755
DANNIC: Bring their injured soldiers to me.

477
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,593
Not if you expect me to
save your Commander.

478
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,869
They're not going to make it.
